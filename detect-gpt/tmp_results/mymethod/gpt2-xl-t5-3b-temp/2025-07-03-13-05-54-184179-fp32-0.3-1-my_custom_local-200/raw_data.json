{"original": ["Royal Oak Mines Inc is reshaping its operations to concentrate on its low-cost gold deposits in the Timmins area and British Columbia, the company president said Wednesday.\n\"We have refocused our strategy to bring on very low-cost production,\" Peggy Witte said in an analysts' conference call. \"It's very clear that's where Royal Oak's future lies.\"  \nThe Kirkland, Washington-based gold producer said Wednesday it will close down its mine in Hope Brook, Newfoundland, and write down the reserves at its Colomac mine in the Northwest Territories.\nRoyal Oak expects to take C$37.4 million in charges because of the Hope Brook and Colomac decisions. After tax, the charges will amount to a decrease in net income of about C$27 million or C$0.19 a share in the fourth quarter of 1996.\nThe company plans to move most of the mining and mill assets from Hope Brook to its Matachewan project in northern Ontario.  \n\"It's a very positive story for us being able to redeploy those assets, and we did not want to spread our senior management too thin,\" Witte said, explaining the decision.\nHope Brook will shut down in the third quarter of 1997, while Matachewan is expected to start production in the second half of 1998, Royal Oak said.\nThe company recently increased its gold reserves at its Timmins and Matachewan properties, decided to expand its Pamour Mill and is putting together a feasibility study for an expanded open pit in the area.  \nThe northern Ontario mines, along with production expected in 1998 from the Kemess copper and gold mine in British Columbia, will boost production and decrease costs significantly for Royal Oak, said chief financial officer Jim Wood.\nThe company expects to produce 375,000 ounces at a cash costs of US$325 an ounce in 1997. In 1998, production will rise to 500,000 ounces at a cost of US$250 or US$260 an ounce. By 1999, the company expects up to 750,000 ounces at about US$240 an ounce, and in 2000, production should be almost one million ounces with costs in the low US$200s, Wood said.  \n\"Although we have closed out Hope Brook cash costs are somewhat disappointing at Colomac, the future of the company, with the Pamour expansion, looks very bright for us in terms of production and our average cash costs,\" he said.\nThe company reported third quarter profits of C$10.2 million or C$0.07 a share, up from C$6.2 million or C$0.05 a share a year earlier.\nGold production rose 13 percent in the quarter to 104,012 ounces from 92,159 ounces during the third quarter last year.\nThe increase came from the Pamour mine in Northern Ontario, which produced higher grade ore.  \nRevenue was 48 percent higher in the third quarter, mainly because of a successful hedging program. The company realized a gold price of US$543 per ounce, compared to US$418 an ounce at the same time last year.\nRoyal Oak expects to produce about 400,000 ounces of gold in 1996 at a cash cost of US$335 an ounce. The lower production level and increase in cash cost from previous estimates are a result of lower grade ore at Colomac.", "Fast-growing Republic Industries Inc., which is led by Florida entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga, said Thursday it would buy Alamo-Rent-A-Car Inc. for $625 million in a move to sharply expand its automobile business.\nThe deal comes less than six weeks after the collapse of Huizenga's $4.3 billion plan to buy security firm ADT Ltd.\n\"Leisure travel is a fast growing segment of the automobile rental industry and Alamo's innovative leadership in this growth sector of the automobile rental marketplace is consistent with our strategy of building consumer-oriented, service related businesses with recognised brand names and strong management,\" Huizenga said in a statement.\nRepublic is expected to use Alamo to expand its burgeoning auto business rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.\nHuizenga \"wants to be the largest used-car sales, leasing and rental provider. It makes sense to have the Alamo fleet as a warehouse for his vehicles,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.\nAlamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.\nAlamo founder and Chairman Michael Egan, who owns about 94 percent of the company, will continue as chairman of Alamo.\nHuizenga said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.\n\"The combination of Alamo with Republic's'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system,\" he said.\nRepublic bought used-car company AutoNation earlier this year and opened its first superstore about two weeks ago in Florida. It plans to open three or four more AutoNation stores this year and quickly expand the chain so there are some 80 stores around the nation by the end of the decade.\nAutoNation will be supplemented by Republic's recent $95 million purchase of used-car superstore firm CarChoice Inc.\nInvestors praised the latest acquisition by Republic, bidding the company's stock up $2.875 to $33.625 on Nasdaq. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.\nIn addition to the automotive industry, Republic specialises in electronic security and solid waste companies. Huizenga also owns the professional Florida Marlins baseball, Panthers hockey and Dolphins football teams.\nHuizenga suffered a setback in late September when his plan to buy security firm ADT was called off after weeks of uncertainty. Although the stock deal was viewed positively from a strategic standpoint, it fell apart due to volatility in Republic's stock and the inability of the companies to revise terms of the transaction.\nAnalysts saw little chance of that happening with Alamo.\n\"I think Alamo provides Republic everything that ADT did, plus more, from the auto side,\" said Jordan Hymowitz of Montgomery Securities, who rates Republic shares as a buy.\nRepublic also said it will pursue more car deals.\n\"We're interested in growing in virtually every segment of the automobile industry,\" spokesman Ronald Castell said, citing rental, used cars, repairs and financing.\nThe acquisition of Alamo marks the latest in a flurry of transactions in the rental car industry.\nOn Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.\nLast month, hotel and real estate operator HFS Inc. bought Avis Inc., the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. HFS has said it will pursue another similar acquisition and launch an initial public offering for part of its rental car subsidiary next year.\nFord Motor Co., which owns Hertz, in July announced it was expanding its rental car business with the acquisition of Budget Rent-a-Car. Ford already had owned part of Budget.\nMeanwhile, Chrysler Corp. wants to sell subsidiaries Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car.", "For 36 years Tibet's biggest leather factory gushed pollution into one of the world's cleanest rivers and haemorrhaged losses.\nBut help was at hand when Tibet's scenic beauty and devout Buddhist people enchanted visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1988.\nGerman aid has since poured in, along with German technicians, transforming the plant into a rare model of environmental awareness on the roof of the world. It has also made its first net profit.\nManager Li Jishan glowed with pride as he described the modernisation wrought at his plant over the last few years.\n\"When I first came here in 1961 things were really backward. We lived in tents. Can you imagine?\" he said in an interview with Reuters.\nThe leather factory was moved to Lhasa in 1959 from Golmud in neighbouring Qinghai province to provide footleather for thousands of soldiers sent to garrison Tibet after an abortive uprising by Tibetans seeking independence in 1958.\nAs a state-owned firm that processes yak skins into shoes and handbags it had little incentive to turn a profit. That is slowly changing.\nLast year, the China-Germany Joint Venture Lhasa Leather Factory of Tibet reported a profit of 200,000 yuan ($24,000) -- a modest sum but the first in its history.\n\"We have a good future, our efficiency is good...and with German assistance we are placing great emphasis on environmental protection,\" said Li, adding that he expected another profit this year.\n\"The German side is very strict, especially on environmental protection,\" he noted. \"But we get along with them very well.\"\nOne problem identified by the German side is one common to most of China's state-owned firms -- the huge surplus labour that is the legacy of jobs-for-life socialism.\n\"We have had arguments with the German experts who want to fire someone, for example,\" said Li. \"But they have come to understand our point of view and our system.\"\nHowever, German officials still warn that keeping on a couple of hundred extra staff is bound to affect profits.\nGerman officials said the plant had been an environmental disaster when they arrived, with its tannery spouting stinking waste into the nearby rushing Tolungchu river.\n\"It was in really bad shape with terrible environmental problems,\" said Niels von Keyserlingk, director of the office of the German Development Corporation in Beijing that oversees aid to the plant.\n\"Before, the water was untreated and flowed into the river causing many problems,\" he said. \"But things have been very nicely done. There is no pollution.\"\nAll chemicals are recycled now and a German-manufactured system cleans the water, separating waste that is dried for use by local farmers as fertiliser.\n\"The water that flows into the river is absolutely clean,\" said von Keyserlingk, who visited the plant last May.\nA cement factory on the opposite bank belching dust into the clear mountain area could pose a new environmental hazard.\nGermany has given 15 million deutschemarks ($9.8 million) in aid to the plant, which has been allowed to register as a joint venture and thus qualifies for the generous tax breaks and holidays that Tibet offers to foreign investors.\nGerman money has helped to buy the latest in leather processing machinery as well as sewing machines, waste elimination plants and even new solar energy panels that are heating water for the factory.\nSales have soared. The factory held an eight percent share of the Tibet shoe market for years, but in 1994 that jumped to 20 percent and nearly doubled again in 1995 to a 36 percent market share.\n\"Our products are really popular because they are all leather, and people want that kind of quality,\" Li said.\nThe factory is trying to boost sales to the rest of China as well as overseas exports, particularly to neighbouring Nepal.\nBut it faces awesome transport handicaps in shipping goods from a city that has no rail links and must send merchandise more than 1,000 km (600 miles) over some of China's most difficult roads to the nearest railway station.\n\"We still need to raise quality and produce more different styles of shoes to compete in the market,\" said Li, who has clearly picked up some tips from his German market-savvy experts.\n\"Either you learn to swim in the market or you drown.\"", "Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.\nThe troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.\nApple's loss, which equalled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.\nBased on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programmes during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.\nPreviously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.\n\"While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,\" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. \"We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.\n\"Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales,\" he said. \"We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter.\"\nNevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996.\n\"Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September,\" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.", "China said on Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.\nBeijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.\n\"We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,\" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters.\n\"The two sides will exchange views,\" he said.\nBeijing said on Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.\nThe temporary import ban would take effect on December 10.\nIn September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.\nChina said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.\n\"We are still seeking the views of Chinese enteprises about which products should be included under the ban,\" the Chinese official said.\n\"That will be determined in another 30 days.\"\nThe total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.\nBut China's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.\nRelations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.\nChina and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.\nThe two sides are preparing for high level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nChristopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.", "The largest electricity provider in the United States marched into Asia on Thursday with a US$2.7 billion deal to buy independent Hong Kong power producer, Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd.\nAtlanta-based Southern Co said it made a general offer to all CEPA's shareholders after agreeing to buy most of a 60.4-percent stake held by CEPA parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd.  \n\"The plan is to use this company as our growth vehicle in Asia,\" Ray Harris, regional director of Southern Electric International Inc, a unit of the Southern Co, told a news conference in the British colony.\n\"We think we paid a fair price and we see it as completing our geographical diversification from the United States,\" he said.\nHopewell said Southern aims to acquire 80 percent of CEPA's shares through a straightforward cash deal of HK$18.50 per share, or a cash and stock offer, he said.  \nHopewell has already agreed to tender 80 percent of its stake under an alternative cash and stock option, which offers one new CEPA share, cash of HK$69.50 and a contingency payment of HK$8.00 for every five CEPA shares.\nThe contingency payment depends on the company managing to secure a limited recourse debt for a power plant in Indonesia.\nHopewell will retain between 12.1 percent and 20 percent of the new company depending on which option shareholders choose.  \nSouthern's planned acquisition of 80 percent of CEPA's shares will effectively privatise the company, reducing its public float below Hong Kong stock exchange requirements and requiring it to de-list.\nShareholders, banks and regulators must still approve the deal, with shareholder meetings slated for November. Closing is expected before the end of the year.\nBoth Southern and CEPA said the takeover complements each other's strengths, with Southern renowned for its operating ability and CEPA one of the first to exploit Asia's quickening thirst for power.  \n\"This is, we felt, a very, very good marriage,\" said Stewart Elliott, CEPA's chief executive officer and managing director. \"If we're going to see Asian growth as everyone has predicted, a massive amount of power is required.\"\nFounded in 1993 as a holding company for Hopewell's power assets, CEPA owns some of southern China's largest power plants.\nIts flagship Shajiao B project in Guangdong province was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$4.1 billion followed by the 1994 start-up of the US$1.87 billion Shajiao C power station.  \nCEPA also owns substantial assets in the Philippines, and said it is negotiating to build more generating plants in southern China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.\nHarris said Southern was committed to pursuing all CEPA's existing plans, which he hopes will be augmented by Southern's expertise and financial muscle.\n\"We are very optimistic about the future.... We would hope we would have some announcements in relation to new power plants (in the next six to 12 months),\" Harris said.\nElliott and Gordon Wu, CEPA's executive chairman and the founder of Hopewell, will remain in place, he said.", "Gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. is negotiating with Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the two companies said on Tuesday.\nThe companies were negotiating under the \"guidance\" of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world's biggest gold deposits, in 1994.\nOfficial estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.\n\"This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X's sale process,\" one analyst said of the news. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.\nTo satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer.\nBre-X said that the Indonesian government \"would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.\"\nThe Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by December 4 or else the government \"will take steps to prevent a delay in the development\" of Busang, Bre-X said.\nDevelopment of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery.\nBre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia's Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.\nA deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview.\nHe said he had no details about how much money or stock would change hands or when a deal would be reached.\nWith the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X's powers to negotiate a favorable deal were curbed, analysts said.\n\"There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X,\" said mining analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. \"That's going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest.\"\nBut Barrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen to treat Bre-X fairly, analysts said.\n\"Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward,\" said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.\nBarrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.30 to C$38.85 by mid-afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose 2-1/4 to 29-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady in active trading at C$20.10, down C$2.45, after the market digested the news.\nIts stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.\nBusang would set Barrick well on its way to achieving its dream of becoming the world's biggest gold company.\nIn 1995, the company -- already North America's largest -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totaling 43.3 million ounces.\nIt has become increasingly aggressive in moving towards its goal, analysts said.\nLast summer, Barrick acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. and its promising Pierina gold property in Peru for about $800 million.", "Lloyds Bank was fined 325,000 pounds ($550,000) Wednesday by a British investment industry watchdog and appears set to pay millions of pounds in compensation to disadvantaged customers.\nThe Investment Management Regulatory Organisation said it fined Lloyds, which merged with TSB last year to form Lloyds TSB Group Plc, for breaches of rules relating to its pensions transfer business between April 1988 and June 1993.\nLloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it, the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products.\nIMRO said Lloyds \"did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers.\"\nIt said Lloyds had not provided certain customers \"with all the information needed to enable them to make a balanced and informed decision on whether to carry out a pension transfer.\"\nLloyds, which must pay IMRO's investigation costs of 63,000 pounds ($107,000) and make a contribution to its disciplinary costs, has already offered redress to some customers and the review of some 2,600 Lloyds transfer cases \"is well advanced and will be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 1997,\" IMRO added.\nThe bank expressed its regret in a statement.\n\"Lloyds Bank deeply regrets the errors which have resulted in charges being brought against it by IMRO for its pension transfer business,\" it said.\nAs a group, Lloyds TSB has made provisions totalling 165 million pounds ($279 million) for possible compensation payments to do with the mis-selling of pension products.\nThese relate to the Lloyds Bank business as well as the pensions activities of TSB before the merger, and of Lloyds' insurance subsidiary Lloyds Abbey Life.\nThe pension scandal, whereby individuals transferred their pensions and were disadvantaged as a result, has been one of the most serious faced by the British financial services industry in recent years.\nThe affair knocked a big hole in the public's confidence in the industry and companies are set to pay a price running into hundreds of million of pounds as a result.\nIn November, Britain's top financial markets regulator the Securities and Investments Board announced a new strategy to try and clear a logjam in the pensions industry's review of the selling of pension products and the payment of compensation to investors.\nBoth regulators and insurance and investment companies have come under a barrage of criticism over the length of time it has taken to complete a review of cases.\nLloyds said it has identified some 2,600 pension transfer customers of which it anticipates having to pay compensation to around 1,500.", "Dairy and fruit juice group National Foods Ltd said on Tuesday its reforms announced in July were now almost fully completed and the group was poised for above-budget profit growth in the next six to nine months.\n\"It's almost fully implemented,\" outgoing National Foods managing director Graham Reaney told Reuters in an interview.\n\"The real benefits start to emerge as people become more familiar with the new structures and clearly there'll be gains over the next six to nine months,\" Reaney said.  \nEarlier on Tuesday National Foods posted a 17.3 percent higher operating profit before tax of A$37.6 million for the year to June 30.\nIts net profit rose to A$15.05 million from A$10.77 million after an abnormal loss of A$7.89 million.\nNet profit before abnormals rose to A$22.7 million from A$19.2 million, against analysts' expectations of about A$23 million.\nNational Foods said in announcing its results, earnings for July and August were ahead of budget and comfortably ahead of last year.  \nReaney repeated that this meant that 1996/97 profits were likely to be higher than in 1995/96, but he would not say how much higher. \"But its clearly going in the right direction.\"\nThe reforms had created a more efficient distribution system for chilled foods, increasing sales coverage for National Foods' products, Reaney said.\n\"It's a combination of cost reduction and enhanced distribution, and looking at our beverage division, our flavoured milks are performing particularly strongly,\" he said.\n\"There are a number of areas that starting to perform a lot better for us.\"  \nReaney said the sale of non-core assets had also been completed and the company was now focused on extracting profit growth from existing assets.\n\"We would consider all businesses that we have today as core businesses,\" he said, adding, however, that he could not rule out future acquisitions.\n\"But the first objective to make those assets that we currently own work better, produce more profit, more cash flow.\"\nSingapore's Camerlin Pte Ltd has about eight percent of National Foods and Hong Kong's Mingly Corp has about 10.4 percent of the company.  \nReaney said he would not comment on shareholders' intentions or actions or whether either of the Asian-based investors planned any takeover or had brought on any board room reshuffle.\nHe said he had resigned the managing director's position having worked for the company for five years. \"Five to seven years is a normal period for a chief executive and quite genuinely I do have other things to do,\" he said.\n\"I'm quite relaxed and if it wasn't an amicable arrangement I wouldn't be staying on as a non-executive director,\" he said on his last day in the job.  \nReaney's replacement, Max Ould, was

This would be the basis for continuing the company's progressive dividend policy.\nThe news boosted Britannic shares, which jumped 71 pence, or nearly nine percent, at one stage before settling for a rise of 29 pence at 832.5.\nThe money attributable to shareholders forms part of total assets in the life funds which amounted to 5.682 billion pounds at the end of 1995.\nThose assets were estimated to have risen by the end of 1996, Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw said, and updated figures would be released on March 18.\nBritannic also announced a restructuring of its long-term funds and the results of a strategic review of its business.\nThe review will lead to new sales management and premium collection systems, streamlining of head office and investment in market analysis and product research.\nThe initiatives are expected to cut operating costs by around 25 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.\nBritannic said it planned to build on its brand, investment management and distribution skills, financial strength and product development abilities to strengthen its position and improve value to policy and shareholders.\nRestructuring the long-term fund will create two continuing \"with profits\" funds, one for its industrial branch and the other for the ordinary branch -- life and pensions business.\nIn future at least 90 percent of the surplus in the with profits funds will be allocated each year to with profits policies. The balance will be shareholders' profit for transfer to the profit and loss account.\nThe company has also created two separate non-profit sub funds -- one for life, one for pensions -- which will contain non-profits business and both of which will be owned by shareholders.\nThe shareholder transfer for 1996 will be increased by 23 million pounds following the declaration of the 209 million pound special bonus. ($ = 0.621 British Pounds)", "The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service.\nThe total was down 75 percent from a similar Federal Communications Commission auction that raised $10.2 billion last May. The average price for a license to provide \"personal communications services,\" or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.\nPCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.\nThe drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.\nThe top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities.\nNext was a unit of long-distance giant AT&T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses.\nThe No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.\nThe FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBased on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.\nThat was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's \"C-Block\" sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.\nThe FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.\n\"It's phenomenally cheaper,\" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.\nMark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices \"more reflective of the current market reality.\"\nAnalysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.\nThe airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.\nAnalysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.\n\"The market is going to be too crowded,\" predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.\nThe steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. \"The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,\" said Bane.\nIn addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.", "General Motors Corp. workers remained on the job without a contract Monday as United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich refrained -- for now -- from calling a strike against the auto giant.\nNegotiations on a new national labor contract covering GM's 215,000 UAW hourly workers recessed early Monday after a midnight strike deadline passed. Yokich said some bargainers would resume talks later in the day.\n\"The only place you can settle these agreements is at the bargaining table,\" Yokich told a news conference early Monday. \"We feel that with or without a contract in place, we can continue (working). It's open-ended.\"\nThe union plans to bring its plant-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting on the talks on Saturday, a move that typically comes after a tentative agreement is reached.\nAlthough Yokich played down the threat of a strike on Monday, he said some of the more than 100 local unions at GM plants may resort to walkouts unless the automaker meets union demands in separate negtiations for local labor agreements.\nThe local talks have become a sticking point for the national negotiations, Yokich said, because only a few of the locals have signed agreements with GM.\nThe local pacts typically cover plant-specific issues such as work rules and health and safety standards, while the national contract covers wages, benefits, job security and other common issues.\n\"We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,\" Yokich said, declining to identify specific plants or issues.\nNevertheless, he urged anxious UAW members who watched their Canadian counterparts strike for three weeks this month to stay on the job for the time being.\n\"We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,\" he said.\nNegotiations at GM's headquarters building here continued for 17 hours until about 2 a.m. EST on Monday, when bargainers began leaving, carrying their overnight bags.\nAlthough some talks were scheduled to resume Monday afternoon, Yokich and other top UAW officers do not plan to return to the bargaining table until Tuesday morning.\nIn a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.\n\"We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,\" Knechtel said.\nYokich chided GM's hard-headed negotiating style as \"typical GM,\" and noted that the union has consistently had a better relationship with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.\nThe UAW wants GM to agree to the same job guarantees granted by Ford and Chrysler, which call for the two companies to guarantee employment for 95 percent of their combined 171,000 UAW members in the United States.\nGM has 12 North American parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee pledges, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.\nAlthough GM is viewed as the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich insisted that the auto giant can live with the pattern.\n\"I think Ford and Chrysler understood when we said we're preparing ourselves and our union to enter the 21st Century with you as partners in the corporation,\" he said. \"I'm not too sure GM understands that. They've always been late bloomers. Maybe they'll get the message sooner or later.\"\nThe UAW's strike threat comes less than a week after GM settled a 20-day strike by the independent Canadian Auto Workers union. The CAW struck over many of the same issues -- job security and shifting jobs to outside suppliers.\nUAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the U.S. union did not feel pressure to get the exact same provisions that GM agreed to in Canada.\nGM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.\nThe National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.\nThe league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.\nThe site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.\n\"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,\" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch \"has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.\"\nIn May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.\nFraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.\nThe second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.\nIn third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.\nOther top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.\nThe League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.", "Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.\nSynopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.\nShares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.\nSynopsys specializes in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specializes in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.\nThe acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.\n\"We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,\" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston. \"Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing\" the tiny \"deep submicron\" circuits.\nSynopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.\nEpic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.\nSynopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, \"ideally March,\" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.", "The British government on Wednesday published proposed new laws governing home lenders which watered down the building societies' immunity from takeover if they converted into banks.\nThe new legislation provoked a cool response from some home lenders and prompted one leading player to say its plans for conversion may well have been different if it had known what the government was planning.\nUnder the new draft law, a building society  would forfeit its five-year immunity from takeover after it converted to bank status if it took over another financial institution.\nThe Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($50 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government had not taken account of its \"serious concerns\" on the timing of the draft.\n\"Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,\" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.\nThe Treasury acknowledged the new Building Societies Bill might not even make it to the statute book before an election because of a lack of parliamentary time between now and next May, the last date for the polls to be called.\nIf it went ahead, the Woolwich spokeswoman said the board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.\nThe Alliance & Leicester in a statement also expressed disappointment, and said areas of concern \"have still not been fully resolved.\"\n\"We will now need to move forward while carefully considering outstanding issues,\" the Alliance statement said, noting the move came in the middle of \"a long and costly conversion process\".\nIn contrast the Northern Rock, a third society which plans a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.\n\"We are delighted with it,\" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. \"It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you can't ask for more than that.\"\nA Treasury spokeswoman said it still hoped to find time for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda in the New Year.\n\"The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,\" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. \"When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Building Societies Association welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.", "Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has been ordered to serve three years in a labour camp in a term imposed just hours after police detained him and a second pro-democracy activist was missing, relatives said on Wednesday.\nVeteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe, who recently issued a joint statement with Liu, appeared to be missing from his home in southern Guangzhou, his wife said by telephone.\nPolice had notified Liu Xiaobo's wife early on Wednesday of the administrative three-year sentence, which does not need a court trial, but gave her no reason for the punishment.\n\"They have still had no formal contact with me or given me a reason,\" Liu Xia said in a telephone interview late in the day.\n\"I am very angry. How can they do this?,\" she said. \"He did not do anything illegal. All he did was exercise his freedom of speech.... Citizens have freedom of speech...\"\nShe said she had not yet decided whether to appeal on his behalf.\nThe administrative punishment was passed against Liu just hours after he was taken from his Beijing home early on Tuesday by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police, with a search warrant, who also confiscated books, papers and photographs.\n\"Re-education through labour is the personal power of the public security bureau, it doesn't have to go through judicial departments,\" Liu Xia said. \"The public security can just do as they wish.\"\nPolice officials declined to comment.\nThe administrative punishment of re-education through labour has been increasingly used against dissidents in recent months as a means of removing activists from circulation while avoiding the more complicated trial process, diplomats say.\nPolice gave no reason for the detention of Liu, a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident in the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nLiu has been active in recent months, sending several daring, open letters to the government.\nOn September 30, Liu and Wang issued a statement urging China's communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations.\nIn a bold move, the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted, impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the \"absolute leadership\" of the party instead of the state.\nWang did not return home on Tuesday and his wife said she was very worried because he had not responded to his pager.\nWang was paroled in 1993 after serving 12 years of a 14-year term for sedition and remains deprived of his political rights. He is one of China's most outspoken proponents of democracy.\nLiu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year. He was held for seven months without charges until being released in January.\nHis sentence comes shortly after Chinese sources said dissident and former student leader Wang Dan faced a second jail term after prosecutors charged him recently with subversion.\nWang, 26, faces up to seven years in jail on charges of counter-revolutionary incitement -- or subversion.\nWang, who is believed to have worked with Liu on several daring petitions, was detained in May, 1995 in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the June 1989 military crackdown.", "Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said on Monday.\nThe share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.\nRumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.\nWhile the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.\n\"The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,\" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.\n\"Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,\" he added.\nBeijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.\n\"The action has cooled speculative activity for now,\" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. \"But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.\"\nIn the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called \"rubbish shares\" which have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.\n\"Retail investors have turned more to blue-chip shares,\" said a trader. \"Their prices have been stable despite the crackdown.\"\nAnalysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.\nOne key problem of the Chinese share markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.\n\"With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,\" said one stock analyst.\nThe draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon partly due to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.\nResponsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.\nShanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.\nIn Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.", "Shares in Premier Farnell dipped on Monday after the newly enlarged electronic components distributor posted half-year profits slightly below expectations.\nPremier Farnell was created in April when Britain's Farnell Electronics completed a $2.8 billion takeover of America's Premier Industrial Corp -- a company twice its size.\nPre-tax profit for the six months to July 28 totalled 56.1 million pounds ($88.4 million). That was down on the pre-tax figure of 71.3 million pounds a year earlier but that had been flattered by a large one-off gain.\nMore pertinently, analysts had forecast profit in a range of 57.5 to 61.6 million pounds and the failure to reach that level was reflected in a 10.5p decline in the share price to 670p.\nThe company said that the market for electronic components has shown much lower levels of growth in 1996 than in recent years and added it did not expect any major change in conditions for the rest of the year.\n\"I think the evidence is we've bottomed the cycle and the signs at the moment are positive. But we are planning on a more conservative basis at this moment in time,\" chief executive Howard Poulson told Reuters.\nPremier said its priorities were the development and international expansion of the catalogue business and further exploitation of synergies between its transatlantic operations.\nPoulson said he was delighted with progress on integration following an acquisition which had transformed the company, based in the northern English town of Wetherby, into the third largest electronic components distributor in the world.\n\"The integration is going superbly..I am very pleased with what people have done on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said.\nHe said he did not see any further scope for cutting costs following the acquisition.\n\"I think we've finished with all of the cost-cutting. This was never a deal which was built on reducing overheads and getting rid of people,\" he said.\n\"We said we would remove duplication in our two head offices -- we've done that, we've probably dropped about 150 people since we made the acquisition.\" The company now has some 6,500 staff, 4,000 of whom are in the United States.\n\"What the business is about now is building sales and building our profits that way,\" he added.\nPremier Farnell said its sales expansion projects were on schedule and should begin to make a contribution in the fourth quarter of the year. REUTER", "H&R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.\nH&R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.\nKansas City-based H&R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.\nH&R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.\nBut plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.\nJust nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&R Block's staid tax business.\nNow they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&R Block's performance.\n\"The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&R Block's valuation,\" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.\n\"How quickly things change,\" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. \"What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.\"\nAnalysts said H&R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.\nH&R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.\n\"Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,\" said Frank Salizzoni, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman.\n\"In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe.\"\nBoth Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.\nThe company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.\n\"This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,\" Salizzoni said.\n\"They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,\" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.\nH&R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq.", "As the world's first Internet bank, Atlanta-based Security First Network Bank has had somewhat of an identity problem with potential customers.\n\"We get a lot of questions,\" Chief Executive Officer James Mahan III said. \"Are you real? Are you virtual? Where are you really?\"\nPart consumer bank, part software testing site, Security First opened its virtual doors a year ago this month.\nBut now Security First plans to add actual doors, opening small offices in Atlanta, Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley in California.\n\"I think we can more effectively market if we have a physical presence,\" Mahan said in an interview.\nComparing his bank to discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co., Mahan said having the offices may give customers a sense of security, even if they never use an office.\nSecurity First's current location is on the Internet. The bank is one of five in the United States that operates directly on the Internet, according to the Bank Administration Institute.\nFederally insured Security First can be accessed at Website (www.sfnb.com), which brings consumers to a home page that looks like a bank lobby.\nCustomers can reach their account anywhere they have access to the Internet, rather than being tied to a single terminal where they have finance software, like other computer banks.\n\"Our goal was to have a bank that was fully interactive, where an individual could see all his information,\" Mahan said.\nMost Security First customers have a money market account and a demand deposit account. Customers can open a checking account with as little as $100, an amount most choose to start to make sure the bank works, Mahan said.\nCustomers can pay bills electronically, purchase certificates of deposits or acquire a Visa card. Security First is also hoping to offer brokerage products and first and second mortgage products by the end of the year. Funds can be accessed by automatic teller machine, and Security First absorbs interbank fees for using the machines.\nWith limited infrastructure, Security First can offer higher yields, Mahan said. The bank was offering a six-month CD with an annaul percentage yield of 5.9 percent.\nSecurity First was spawned as an idea of Mahan, who was chief executive officer at Kentucky-based Cardinal Bancshares Inc., and his sister-in-law's husband, Michael McChesney, who was starting a security software firm.\n\"He educated me on the Internet for years and years and years,\" Mahan said. Mahan used the charter of one of Cardinal's thrifts, changed its name to Security First and used it to start the Internet bank.\nMcChesney's, firm, SecureWare Inc. developed software that Mahan said has military-grade security. So far, the bank has not had its security breached, Mahan said.\n\"That doesn't mean that there haven't been a number of sophisticated attempts,\" he said. \"If you have enough money and enough time you can break into anything.\"\nOutsiders agree that Security First has shown a record of being secure, avoiding viruses, data theft and other potential dangers of Internet commerce.\n\"They do use a level of security that the Pentagon reserves for its most secure and sensistive systems,\" said Paul Schmeltzer, executive vice president for network services at Southeast Switch Inc., the corporate organisation for the Honour Network, the fourth largest ATM network in the country. \"Is any security design totally foolproof or totally secure? Probably not.\"\nThat software and others developed for the bank is likely to be the prime money maker for Security First. Mahan admits that Five Paces Inc., Security First's software unit, will be the prime contributor to the company's net income.\n\"The bank is really a test site to use as a demonstration for potential customers of the software business,\" said Gary Craft, an analyst who follows the bank for Alexandria, Va..-based Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.\nSecurity First's stock is traded on Nasdaq.\nSecurity First has opened about 5,600 accounts. Most of its customers are male, between the ages of 25 and 45, with average income above $63,000 a year. More than 80 percent own their own home, attractive demographics for marketing.\nSecurity First has also attracted competition. This month, Atlanta Internet Bank opened for business.\nUnlike Security First, Don Shapleigh, chief executive of Atlanta Internet, says he does not plan to open any customer offices. \"I have the WorldNet. I have other ways to get out.\" Federally insured Atlanta Internet currently offers its services to subscribers of AT & T's WorldNet Services.\nShapleigh also argues that Atlanta Internet is the first true Internet only bank, saying that Security First is really a software company.\n\"I'm not selling software,\" he said. \"I'm a banker.\"\nAtlanta Internet, which is a service provided by a unit of Carolina First Corp. can be reached on the Internet at (www.atlantabank.com).", "Federal regulators are set to kick off a two-part plan to slash rates on overseas phone calls, a move that could save consumers and companies billions of dollars but may ruffle the feathers of foreign governments.\nThe Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to make it simpler for U.S. and foreign phone companies to negotiate cheaper rates for international calls to and from the United States.\nNext month the FCC is expected to propose rules to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete overseas calls made from the United States.\n\"The ultimate goal is to get lower-priced and better-quality services for consumers,\" said Don Gips, head of the FCC's international bureau.\nOfficials say the foreign charges, or \"accounting rates,\" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.\nU.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.\n\"This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.\nWhile the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.\nThe United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others.\n\"Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous\" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.\nU.S. carriers support the strategy.\n\"You've got to move accounting rates to cost,\" said AT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost is 7 to 8 cents a minute.\nThe FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.\nTo cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as possibly Britain, Canada and Chile.\nThe FCC will waive its \"proportionate return\" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for overseas calls. To win a waiver, a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.\nThe existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market.\nIf AT&T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&T.\nThe FCC proposal due next month would set \"benchmark\" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.\nThe agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.\n\"It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,\" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\nBut the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidise local phone service.", "Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.\nAnalysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97.\n\"You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997,\" Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  \n\"There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997,\" he said.\n\"You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing.\"\nThe median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.\nThis compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95.", "CMS Energy Co should have no trouble meeting or exceeding the $2.40 to $2.45 a share earnings estimates that analysts forecast for all of 1996, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William McCormick said Friday.\n\"We feel very comfortable we'll be at or above that range,\" he said in a telephone interview from the utility's Dearborn, Mich. headquarters. CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned $2.27 a share on total revenues of $3.9 billion in 1995.  \nEarlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10-year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.\nThe settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  \n\"The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,\" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.\nMcCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings write-downs related to the project. CMS recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  \nCMS' stock was up $1 to $32-3/8. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.\nCMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid-1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gas-powered energy plant in 1990.\nMidland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS; Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.\nApproval of the settlement prompted Standard & Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and re-affirm its ratings on the companies.\nMcCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.", "Family-controlled British food and retailing group Associated British Foods should report a sharp rise in full year profits on Monday, as its retail and textile business benefit from a pickup in high street spending.\n\"The two parts of the business really driving the increase are the retail and clothing side which is benefitting from the feel-good factor,\" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. Analysts forecasts are centred on pretax profits of 415 million stg up from 375 million last time and a dividend increase to 9.5p from 8.8p.  \nABF, a food processor and manufacturer in Britain, Australia and the United States, as well as a food and textile retailer in Britain and Ireland, is also widely expected to yield yet more cash from British Sugar.\n\"The feature of the figures as ever is the strong cashflow coming out of British sugar. Net cash should rise by about 130 million pounds which always begs the question will they spend it?\" said UBS analyst Charlie Mills.\nThat would bring net cash to 735 million stg at year end.  \nOn the retail side PriMark, women's clothing chain in Ireland and Britain, as well as the Irish retailing businesses -- Stewarts supermarkets in Northern Ireland and Crazy Prices and Quinnsworth -- are expected to perform much better.\nHowever the mainstream side of the business, British Sugar which contributes about 50 percent of profits, is likely to be slightly weaker after a hot summer in 1995 affected the sugar beet crop and margins came under pressure from the strength of sterling which made European imports look cheaper.  \nAside from British sugar, analysts expect the grocery business, like milling and baking, Rivita and Burton biscuits to show improvements.\nOn average analysts forecast trading profit from groceries, excluding British Sugar, to rise by 14 million stg to 82 million in the belief that the company has managed to claw back some of the margin on non-packaged food.\nIncluding British Sugar operating profits are predicted to increase to about 265 million from 252 million previously.\nABF shares have risen consistently from 280p in January to 418-1/2p at Friday's close.\nConsensus estimates, taken from a Reuter poll of 17 brokers, for 1996 is 30.1, rising to 31.6 in 1997.\nThe company has a return on equity of 11.5 percent, putting it in 28th slot in the FTSE-All share food manufaturing sector of 57 companies.", "Investment bank Macquarie Bank Ltd reported on Monday a record result for the six months ended September 30, and started the second half optimistically.\nMacquarie Bank, which is 13.4 percent owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), reported a 21.3 percent rise in first half net profit to A$46.03 million in the first half of 1996/97.\n\"This was a very solid first half result and one which reflects more even contributions fom business groups across the bank,\" executive chairman David Clarke said.  \n\"Although it is too early to make a forecast, we are optimistic about the second half,\" Clarke said.\nWhile the 1995/96 second half was very strong, he said the bank was hopeful it could at least match the result.\n\"There has been nothing to change that view following the trading for the first two months of this half.\"\nManaging director Allan Moss said the equities, treasury and commodities group accounted for most of the first half rises.\n\"The Treasury and Commodities Group's first half result is the best since the formation of the group in 1993,\" Moss said.  \n\"The strong result in the Equities Group reflects good performances from institutional and corporate stockbroking and underwriting,\" Moss said.\nMoss said the near 400 percent increase in profit from its stockbroking arm, Macquarie Equities Ltd, was due partly to an increase in market share, but mainly due to market volume.\nMacquarie's Direct Investment division, which manages the Macquarie Investment Trusts, also had a good result, Moss said.\nThe bank was currently very active right across all its operations, Moss said. \"We are busy right across the board. There is a lot of activity in all our operations,\" he said.  \nMacquarie said total operating income rose to A$232.69 million in the half, from A$190.21 million a year earlier.\nThe Brunei government-owned BIA became Macquarie's largest shareholder after it bought Lloyds TSB Plc's 13.4 percent stake for A$151.7 million last week.\nMacquarie's chairman said there had been a good reaction to the link with BIA.\n\"We have had a very positive reaction from a number of existing clients, particularly in southeast Asia. I think it has been widely acclaimed in southeast Asia that it would lead to more business in the region,\" Clarke said.  \nMacquarie, which listed in late July, reported a net profit of A$93.17 million in the year to March 31, 1996, up from A$76.07 million a year earlier.\nClarke said Macquarie had no plans to return capital to shareholders or to make a takeover due to its high capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Macquarie's CAR was 13.6 percent at September 30, down from 15.4 percent at March 31, 1996.\nThis ratio compares with the Reserve Bank of Australia's minimum requirement of eight percent.\n\"As far as any prospect of share acquisition or buy-back, we have nothing in mind yet,\" Clarke said.  \n\"I think it is the nature of our business to have a capital adequacy ratio that is higher than the trading banks because we are very dependent on counter-party limits from other banks, they in turn are quite dependent on ratings...it is a healthy capital adequacy ratio and I think we can expect to be well and truly above the basic minimum,\" Clarke said.\nAt 2.00 p.m. (0300 GMT), Macquarie shares were 11 cents lower at A$8.55 with about 160,000 shares traded in a generally weaker Australian sharemarket.\nThe shares listed on the local bourse in July at A$6.95.", "Westpac Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia, announced plans on Wednesday to expand its Asian activities through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc.\nThe move signals Westpac is ready to expand in the region again after putting most of its Asian activities up for sale 3-1/2 years ago to focus on Australasia.\nAt the time a recession was biting deeply into profits and the share register held potential predators such as Australia's richest man Kerry Packer and Lend Lease Corp Ltd.  \nWestpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement the deal with Standard Chartered was of major importance.\n\"It is a good strategic fit for our future growth,\" he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to \"ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long term benefit to both companies\".\nThe venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac Institutional and International Banking.", "Germany and the Czech republic announced on Monday that a long-awaited declaration on post- World War Two reconciliation would be initialled this week but politicians on both sides withheld final approval of the text.\nThe two foreign ministries said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Germany's Klaus Kinkel would sign the document in Prague on Friday, at a ceremony ending two years of talks.\nThe declaration, expressing regret at both Nazi atrocities during the war and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from former Czechoslovakia afterwards, then has to be signed by the two countries' presidents and confirmed by the two parliaments.\nBut Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), political sponsor of the expelled Germans, said its support for the text was not guaranteed.\n\"I would speak of a conditional'yes',\" Finance Minister and CSU chairman Theo Waigel told reporters. He said last-minute changes to the text could not be ruled out.\nFinal approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudeten Germans, as they are known, would be \"involved at an appropriate level\" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn, he said.\nThe Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.\nIn the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.\nMembers of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.\n\"(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),\" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.\nStanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.\nThe Czech foreign ministry said in a statement that Zieleniec and Kinkel would \"sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development\".\nThe full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.\nThe text angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who had lost property during the expulsions.\nThe declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.\nThe text says the fund is to finance \"projects of common interest\" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.\nBut the text adds that: \"The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.\"\nGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nIn early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.", "America Online Inc, the world's largest online service, said with the changes it implemented earlier this fall and its major restructuring announced this week, it is seeing a renewed momentum.\nSteve Case, AOL chairman and CEO, told the company's annual meeting that with the reoganization of AOL, its new flat-rate pricing, and its big accounting changes, \"the pieces are now in place\" for growth, not only in new subscribers, but with major new sources of revenue, such as advertising.  \n\"Now we have a new structure in place...and the momentum is stronger than ever,\" Case told shareholders, adding that in the month of October alone, AOL added 250,000 new subscribers, a sign of its \"renewed momentum.\"\nThe company, which has seen its stock decline, has been under pressure from the lower-cost Internet access services and has seen its subscriber growth slow this summer.  \nAOL, based in Dulles, Va., was further pressured when Microsoft Corp relaunched the Microsoft Network this month at a flat price of $19.95 for unlimited access, on par with most direct Internet access services.\nPreviously, AOL had added a 20/20 pricing plan to combat the growing competition, with 20 hours for $19.95 a month, in addition to its $9.95 for 10 hours plan.  But on Monday, it succumbed with its own flat rate $19.95 a month, and it will discontinue its direct Internet access, called GNN.  \nCase and other AOL executives highlighted to shareholders how the company will see new sources of revenue from advertising and merchandising and how one area of its new business will be running on a cable industry model, with more revenues from advertising than subscriber fees.\n\"Increasingly, we are evolving where we depend less on subscriber revenue and increasingly on advertising and other sources,\" said Lennert Leader, the company's chief financial officer.  \nOne of the areas from which the company expects this growth to come is its new unit AOL Networks, headed by former MTV executive Bob Pittman, to oversee AOL's flagship online service.  The other two units in AOL's reorganization are its AOL Studios, to create content for its service and ANS Communications, to manage the core network infrastructure.\nPittman said he expects that in the future, over 50 percent of AOL's revenues will come from advertising and other revenue sources, such as merchandising the AOL brand name, through books, television, etc.  \n\"To me, it looks very similar to the cable network business,\" Pittman said, adding that in the early days of Viacom Inc's MTV network, subscriber revenue was greater than advertising revenue.  \"Our growth curve looks very similar to the cable business.  Ad revenue is growing faster than subsciber revenues.\"\nPittman said he plans to \"ride the tremendous wave\" of AOL's brand recognition for new sources of revenue growth, for which he said there are multi-levels of possibilities. One area, he mentioned after his second day on the job, is the catalog business, which can move to electronic shopping.  \nShareholders, some of whom said the stock has been a very good investment because of its many stock splits, said they were pleased with AOL's recent actions, in particular the measure to restructure accounting methods.\n\"The fact that they are getting a more straightforward accounting system is a step in the right direction,\" said David Ryan, a retired shareholder from the Washington, D.C. area. \"Their financial statements were hard to understand. It's more straightforward now.\"  Ryan said the stock has split three times since he has owned it in the past four or five years.  \nAOL said on Monday that it will now expense all its marketing costs, which includes the hefty subscriber acquisition costs, as they are incurred, instead of deferring those costs over time.\nTo reflect those immediate changes, AOL is taking a $385 million restructuring charge in the September quarter, to account for the balance of its deferred subscriber acquisition costs.  AOL CFO Leader also told the meeting that the cost to acquire new subscribers will be lower in the future, as AOL depends less on sending out floppy disks, and as AOL comes with more new PCs.\n\"The good news is the growth is accelerating,\" Case said. \"We have taken the step of expensing the marketing and we can avoid some of the debates about the earnings.\"", "Britain's Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.\n\"We think we can stand on our own feet,\" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.\nThe building society's nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  \nGilchrist said the building society's decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.\nIt will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.\n\"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,\" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  \n\"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,\" Gilchrist said.\nEarlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.\nGilchrist said members would get a \"broad idea\" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  \nHe also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.\n\"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,\" he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote \"as quickly as possible\" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  \n\"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,\" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nBut it was working on the basis that a \"large number\" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.\nThose who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they \"may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting\" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.", "Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.\n\"We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,\" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was \"a very good start\" and showed new businesses were \"making a valuable contribution to profitability.\"\n\"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,\" Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming's London-based fund company. In September the company's chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.\nFlemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a \"marginally lower\" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.\nThis was after taking into account provisions \"arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years,\" it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.\nHe described the events as a \"painful experience.\" \"But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand,\" he added.\nAny impact these problems may have had on Flemings' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.\nFlemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported \"a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking.\"\nIts capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.\nThe appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.\nWilliam Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.", "Polar Air Cargo is to start new services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai in Japan and Manila within the next four months, the all cargo carrier's executive vice president Jack Kane said.\nSpeaking after the handover of Polar's first Boeing 747-200 and 14th 747 freighter in all, Kane said the new acquistion from Air Hong Kong will offer longer ranges, higher weights and reduced fuel consumption for the company's Asian network which is about to rapidly expand.\nPolar is awaiting final U.S. Depart of Transportation approval to begin flying to Kansai after agreement with the Japanese transportation ministry that Polar should become the third U.S. all cargo carrier, he said.\n\"The indications seem very favourable,\" he said.\nThe U.S.-based airline has also won permission to fly to Bangkok and expects to start services to Manila in the first quarter of 1997.

The 747-200 means Polar no longer has to stop in Khabarovsk in Russia to refuel.\nPolar does not have rights into China but has been holding discussions with Chinese airlines on a possible joint venture. Kane declined to name the possible partners but said Polar has already cooperated with China Eastern on charter cargo flights.\nKane said Polar intends to start operating a second 747-200 aircraft, an ex Philippine Airlines Combi which is to be converted, in the first quarter of next year.

Negotiators have met only during normal business hours and do not plan to meet over the weekend.\nUAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to characterize progress of the discussions, only to say bargainers were \"down to the larger issues.\"\nBut Hargrove has not asked Yokich to delay a U.S. settlement with GM during the Canadian strike.\nThe CAW launched an escalating strike on October 3 and all the union's 26,000 GM workers were on the picket line by midnight on Wednesday.  \nThe UAW has about 215,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM and, so far, only about 2,000 have been idled at an engine plant and a transmission plant.\nThe strike may affect some of GM's U.S. plants next week, although the automaker canceled most overtime work this week.\nHargrove said he saw no progress in talks with the automaker.\n\"I don't want to kid anybody,\" he said. \"It hasn't been very productive last few days, I do not believe it will be productive today.\"\nHargrove wanted the Canadian walkout to have as little effect on GM's U.S. production as possible so as to protect UAW workers and the profit-sharing checks they expect to receive this year. Prolonged shutdowns in the U.S. due to lack of Canadian-made parts could seriously hurt GM's profits and reduce profit sharing for employees.", "Sun Microsystems Inc. said Wednesday its profits rose 41 percent in the latest quarter and its revenues jumped to record levels, driven by sales of the company's server computer and power desktop systems.\nSun said its net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 29 rose to $178.3 million from $126 million in second quarter a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 46 cents from 32 cents.\nRevenues rose nearly 19 percent to $2.08 billion.\nThe per share earnings beat Wall Street expectations of 42 cents, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.\n\"The current fiscal year continues to yield strong financial results,\" Sun Microsystems Chief Financial Officer Michael Lehman said in a statement. \"Sun is winning big in corporate intranets, the Internet, and the extranet.\"\nSo-called intranets are in-house networks modeled on the Internet, while extranets, which are secure networks outside a company, such as a private network.\nLehman said the company's investments in research and development and sales and support infrastructure were paying off as it moved to broaden its global presence.\nThe company said gross profit margins rose to 50.4 percent, up more than 5 percentage points from the comparable period the previous year.\nSun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy told analysts in a conference call that it was difficult to say whether the strong gross margins were sustainable.\nSun's order backlog rose to $470 million from $407 million in its first quarter, but it was still much less than the $522 million backlog at the end of its 1996 fiscal year last June.\nMcNealy said the company planned to announce new high-end computers, codenamed Starfire, next week as it seeks to offer computers that can be used for the most intensive corporate computing tasks, like databases and network management.\nLehman said initial market data showed Sun appeared to be taking market share from its traditional rivals, and he said Sun will continue to make further significant price cuts.\nThe executives said Sun was deriving increasing amounts of revenues from storage products, professional services and licensing of products based on the Java programming language, which is used to develop Internet applications.", "Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly plans to double exports to Europe by 2010, mostly via its ambitious $40 billion Yamal pipeline project, but energy analysts said the timing could be wrong.\n\"There's a market problem (with oversupply in Europe), and the cost of developing the Yamal field will be too high,\" said a senior European energy specialist familiar with the project.\n\"Europe is at saturation level for the next 10 years or so, so Gazprom is 5-10 years too early.\"\nThe Yamal-Europe project envisions building a gas pipeline network across 4,107 km (2,550 miles) from Russia's vast Arctic Yamal peninsula reserves to Germany via Belarus and Poland.\nGazprom wants to take advantage of rising European demand.\nTo help raise capital for Yamal, RAO Gazprom is offering American Depositary Shares as part of a plan to sell a total nine percent stake abroad.\n\"Europe can hardly wait for this project,\" said Alexander Litvinov, Gazprom's chief public relations specialist.\nA company statement said: \"The company faces significant requirements for capital expenditures.\"\nThe Yamal system, to be built in stages and linking with existing pipelines in some places, would have an initial capacity of 83 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, including around 52 bcm to Western Europe.\nGazprom said the Yamal-Europe pipeline would boost Russia's export capacity to 124 billion bcm by 1997 and 154 bcm by 1999. Sales outside the former Soviet Union were 117.4 bcm in 1995.\nThe company wants annual exports to rise by 50 bcm by 2010.\nGazprom has won big Western credits to build European parts of the Yamal link into Poland's grid and Belarus, but it has not won financing for the main part of the system or to boost output at Yamal itself, which it hopes to begin doing by 2000.\nPierre Bauquis, special adviser to the president of French company Total SA, told an energy conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty last week that Russia had huge gas reserves but big financial constraints.\n\"Yamal is not needed before 2010,\" he said.\nHe said netbacks (a key indicator of profitability) on Yamal gas to Germany today were negative, \"so Yamal is not obvious from an economic standpoint.\"\nGazprom sees Yamal as the goose that will lay the golden egg, since the area has recoverable reserves of 10,400 bcm, or 20 percent of Russia's total proven reserves.\nBut Yamal gas, some under permafrost, is in a remote area and is quite expensive to recover.\nSome analysts say it may be cheaper to tap and transport Algerian and Norwegian gas to European markets than to extract Yamal gas in the volumes and time-frame Gazprom plans.\nRussian gas already accounts for 60 percent of Europe's total gas imports. Russia has more than one-third of world gas reserves and 26 percent of output, and is the world's single largest producer, with output of 556 bcm last year.\nGazprom accounts for 94 percent of Russian gas output and transports nearly all of it. The firm wants output to rise to 820 bcm a year by 2010.\nRussia exports only 20 percent of its output, and declining industrial consumption at home has left Russia with an oversupply. Europe is also flush with supplies, though demand is set to rise.\n\"The fact that Gazprom does not have its own financing for Yamal and that it has not been able to find domestic or foreign financing (for the main part of the project) speaks quite negatively about its economics,\" said the European source.", "Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment.\nThe 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines.\nThe deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.  \nNew Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems.\n\"It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,\" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom.\nHowever, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.  \nIn the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems.\nTo speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.  \nAs part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard.\nModems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.  \nIn the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard.\nU.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O.\nRobotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said.\nRockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.  \nNonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier.\nMicrocom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.  \nMicrocom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat.\nMicrocom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997.\nThayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support.\n\"They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,\" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership.\nHowever, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives.\nThis plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said.", "Despite losing out on two potential aircraft deals, McDonnell Douglas Corp's stock remains near its 52-week high, reflecting a strong balance sheet and expectations it will make an acquisition.\n\"The company is generating on the order of about $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion of free cash flow annually, which translates into between $5 and $7 a share,\" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch, who has a buy rating on the stock.\nThat could enable the company to buy back shares or make a long-awaited defense acquisition, he added.  \nAlthough it lost out on the race to build a next generation fighter for the Pentagon and rival Boeing Co was awarded a 103-plane AMR Corp deal, McDonnell Douglas shares remain relatively strong.  Shares were down $0.25 at $52.625 a share on Monday, $4.125 below a 52-week high of $56.75 but more than $10 above a low of $42.125.\nIn fact, losing out on the potential $2.2 billion in jet fighter contracts -- which could eventually be worth as much as $500 billion to the ultimate winner -- could prompt McDonnell Douglas to pursue an acquisition aggressively to build its defense business, analysts added.  \nCS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said he expected the company's \"board and management to take a fairly proactive stance...to do something in the merger and acquisition area.\"\nAnalysts also shrugged off Boeing getting the plane order from AMR's American Airlines, saying McDonnell Douglas was not a serious contender after it cancelled development of its next generation commercial plane, known as the MD-XX.\n\"They were never in the running,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan said of McDonnell Douglas.  \n\"The events don't affect near-term earnings in either case,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel said of the lost jet fighter and American Airlines deals.\nMcDonnell Douglas management said the Pentagon business would have been a significant long-term program for it.  But analysts said the company still has a chance to capture future military sales, particularly with acquisitions to build its portfolio, which now includes the F-18 fighter jet, C-17 military cargo plane and Apache helicopter.  \n\"The things to keep in mind are, the joint strike fighter is a long ways away.  It doesn't affect McDonnell Douglas' business portfolio near term,\" Callan said.\nCallan added it is possible the new fighter jet might not be developed due to U.S. government budget pressures. And, in the interim, McDonnell Douglas could make its existing fighter jets more affordable and more capable.\nAnalysts dismissed the ideas that takeover speculation has been boosting McDonnell Douglas shares.  Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas was reported to be in preliminary merger talks with Boeing, but a deal never materialized.  \"I don't think the people who own the stock today are looking at McDonnell Douglas as a takeover candidate,\" Callan said.", "The Czech ruling centre-right coalition agreed on Monday to name Vlasta Parkanova as justice minister, replacing Jan Kalvoda who resigned last month after he admitted to using an unattained \"Doctor of Law\" title.\nBut coalition leaders agreed to wait on the choice of a replacement for Kalvoda, who is chairman of a small right-wing junior coalition party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), in the more politically-sensitive post of deputy prime minister.\n\"We received an official proposal from the ODA for a new justice minister.... as Doctor Parkanova. We approved this proposal by the ODA on the coalition level,\" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the head of the senior Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference.\nAfter a meeting with his coalition partners Klaus said that Parkanova could be officially appointed by President Vaclav Havel as soon as Tuesday.\nParkanova, 45, a certified doctor of law, currently serves as a chief of staff at the Interior Ministry.\nShe would become the first woman to have a seat in the Prague government since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.\nODA vice chairman Karel Ledvinka said the coalition agreed to a request by his party to postpone nomination of the new deputy prime minister, who would lead the party in the tenuous minority cabinet, until after the party's congress in March.\nKalvoda's position as chairman of the pro-business ODA is also to be decided at the March party congress.\nThe ODA has four seats in the 16-member cabinet under a coalition agreement with the ODS and the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), plus one of four deputy premierships.\nKalvoda and the KDU-CSL leader Josef Lux have fought heated policy battles with Klaus's party, which controls half of the cabinet, but the coalition remains the longest-running conservative government in post-Communist Europe.\nTensions have been heightened since June when the coalition lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.\nKalvoda, a parliamentary deputy and a cabinet member since the coalition was formed in 1992, was the fifth member of parliament who admitted using the title of Juris Doctor without actually having qualified for it.\nOut of the other four fake doctors, only one has resigned her parliamentary seat.", "Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy.\nShares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.\nThe Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995.\nDeclining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.\n\"Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,\" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.\nThe key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard & Poors 500.\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.\nBank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.\nHe added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.\n\"The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,\" Thiessen said.\nAfter several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.\nCanada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.\nSeveral Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.\nGregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. \"I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,\" he said.\n\"Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,\" Gregory said.\nThe Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995.\nIn stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks.\nThe TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday.

The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.\nRecent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks.\nNew York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.", "Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.\nEncryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" were once the realm of spies and generals.\nBut with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.\nSenators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.\nThe bills \"roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,\" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n\"Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,\" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, also a co-sponsor.\nThe bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.\nUnder the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software \"key\" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.\nIf the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.\nThe legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.\nThe Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.\n\"We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,\" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. \"We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.\"\nComputer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.\n\"Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,\" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.\n\"This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,\" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.\nBerman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be \"my lock, my key.\"", "Hunting so-called \"fat cats\" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country's top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders.\nThe latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets.\nBut questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain's most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance.\nBoth last year's Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.\nThis has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.\n\"Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,\" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.\nSkipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit.\nThis means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.\n\"It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,\" one industry insider told Reuters.\nLast week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.\nMelville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.\nA row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.\nLast year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.\n\"That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),\" Norwich Union's Skipper said.\nThe Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies \"have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers\".\nSkipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. \"It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,\" she said.\nBut her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.\nHis mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.", "Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can close suddenly without warning.\nNearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.\nThe problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.\nNHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.\nOwners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.\nChrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.\nChrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.\nChrysler told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.\nChrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.\nBut NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.\nChrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson said the automaker was working with the safety agency to resolve the complaints. Injuries reported from sudden closings of rear hatch doors have been minor, she said, noting Chrysler stood behind the safety record of its vehicles.\n\"Minivans are the safest vehicles on the road today,\" she said.\nSeparately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.\nIn addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.\nAlso, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle.

Later surgeons described the planned surgery as \"medium serious\".\nThe Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.\nHavel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.\nUnder the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel's place.\nHavel's power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.\nOpinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.\nTurnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.\nHavel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.", "China hailed on Tuesday its war on bourgeois decadence as the top news event of 1996 along with missile tests off Taiwan, but ignored improved ties with the United States and the jailing of a dozen dissidents.\nThe line-up of the top 10 news events in China in 1996 as selected by senior editors of the major Communist Party-linked newspapers closely reflected the party line on news -- or propaganda.\nThe list issued by the Xinhua news agency differed sharply from events in China that have focused international eyes on the world's most populous country in the last 12 months.\nHeading the list selected by 12 Beijing editors was the annual plenum of China's ruling Communist Party in October that adopted a 15,000-word document exhorting China's 1.2 billion people to adhere to socialist ethics and abhor bourgeois Western liberalism.\nOn Christmas Eve, it was unclear how far socialist values extended, but Santa Claus appeared to be exempt as he smiled and waved from dozens of Beijing and Shanghai department stores.\nPolitics, not only news value, may have coloured the views of many of the editors, who would have remembered that the plenum was trumpeted as one of the major achievements of Communist Party chief, state President and army boss Jiang Zemin -- anointed heir to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nNewspaper editors elsewhere in the world would probably have chosen Beijing's campaign to intimidate Taiwan in the run-up the island's first popular elections of a Chinese president on Chinese soil as the top story of 1996.\nHowever, for Chinese editors the decision to conduct missile tests and live-fire war games in waters near the island last March, and which sent U.S. aircraft carriers steaming into neighbouring seas, ranked only fourth in their top 10.\nThe news item in second place related to China's resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong in mid-1997, or Premier Li Peng's decision to sign off on the appointment of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive.\nOther editors might have focused less on the role of a single Chinese leader in Tung's elevation and more on his selection by a Beijing-sponsored committee of his peers.\nFour of the top 10 Chinese news stories were linked to economic achievements and one to sports -- the Atlanta Olympic Games in which China ranked fourth overall in the medals' tally.

Colder climates would shorten the vehicles' already limited range, which is a maximum of 70 to 90 miles under ideal conditions, GM says.\nCalifornia, which recently eased its 1998 mandate for electric vehicles, is expected to offer consumer incentives for the vehicle.\nDepending on such incentives, monthly lease payments on the car will probably fall between $400 and $500, about the same as a $30,000 luxury car, GM officials said at a news briefing.\nCustomers will have to add another $50 a month or so to lease a 220-volt charging unit and pay to have it mounted in their garage. But the electricity to run the EV1 is a bargain -- about a penny a mile, versus gasoline costs of four to five cents a mile for an average normal car.\nGM executives will not discuss production plans or sales targets for the vehicle and say they plan to let market dictate demand. But Kennedy said he expects the initial demand to outstrip supply due to the vehicle's novelty.\nSo far, about 1,000 people have called a toll-free telephone number, and dealers have taken names of 300 serious customers, including Tonight Show host Jay Leno, he said.\nCustomers who want performance won't be disappointed with the EV1. The whisper-quiet vehicle offers neck-snapping acceleration and sports-car like handling, although a heavy foot will quickly drain the battery, requiring a three- to four-hour recharge.\n\"We can keep up with a Nissan 300ZX from zero to 30\" miles an hour, said Sean McNamara, marketing manager for GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group.\nThe car's aerodynamic tear-drop shape, considerably narrower in the rear than in the front, slips through the wind easily and looks unlike anything else on the road.\nGM could have built a spartan small boxy car but wanted its first electric vehicle to have some flair, said Robert Purcell, general manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles.\n\"This is the car that gets the market started,\" he said. \"We wanted to put out a car that was very exciting so that people would fall in love with it.\"\nThe sporty configuration was aimed at highly educated customers with incomes of $125,000 a year who like high technology, GM said. The customers also likely own two other vehicles for longer trips or heavy hauling.\nSaturn, which won't necessarily sell all future GM electric vehicles, plans to emphasise its customer-friendly sales practices more heavily for the EV1.\nThe decision to lease the vehicle was made in part to protect consumers from the inevitable march of technology. The automaker does not want EV1 customers to be stuck with obsolete cars in a few years, as personal computer owners often are.\nAt the end of the lease, GM is considering refitting the plastic and aluminum-bodied cars with newer technology and leasing them again, Purcell said.\nThe division also is training about 14 EV1 \"product specialists\" to handle sales of the vehicle at 26 designated dealerships in California and Arizona.\nThe specialists will come to a prospective customer's home, office, or elsewhere to explain the details of the car and the charging unit.\nThey'll work with the utility companies and arrange municipal permits for the installations, Kennedy said, adding that it will probably take about a week to set up a customer with a car and charger.\nGM has invested $350 million in developing the EV1, which it does not expect to recoup through sales of the first generation vehicle, Purcell said. But the car does pioneer a wide range of exotic materials and new technology that could find its way to other GM vehicles.\nMagnesium and other lightweight materials counteract the weight of batteries, and the cars have braking systems that transfer power back to the battery.\nDespite the technology, the cars are largely hand-built at a Lansing, Mich., plant that produced the now-defunct Buick Reatta in the late 1980s. The operation employs 54 production workers but could be expanded quickly, GM officials said.", "At least 23 people were murdered in attacks in central and northern Colombia, including an entire family hacked to death with machetes, police said on Thursday.\nUnidentified axe and machete-wielding assailants killed three children, their mother and grandparents early on Thursday in San Miguel de Sema, in central Boyaca province, police chief Col. Humberto Prieto said.\n\"We're investigating to see if these killings are related to the death of two other relatives several years ago. Early indications suggest they were murdered for personal reasons -- a revenge attack,\" Prieto said.\nBoyoca is known as a stronghold of right-wing paramilitary groups but Prieto said San Miguel was not affected by right-wing or leftist political violence.\nIn northern Sucre province, the bullet-ridden bodies of 17 peasants were found scattered in four isolated areas near the town of Tolu Viejo on Thursday morning, police said.\n\"We're still looking at all the facts. The province has been hard hit by subversion,\" said Benjamin Irragori, regional head of the state security service DAS.\nHe said two fronts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were active in the area.\nSucre has seen a recent rash of attacks by right-wing paramilitary death squads. One television report, which quoted a police source as saying the leading suspects in the massacre were rightists, showed some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.\nAlmost 40 people died in a wave of killings, attributed to paramilitary groups, across northern Colombia two weeks ago. Last month, the country's paramilitary forces held a summit in which they pledged to step up their war against leftist guerrillas and rebel sympathisers.\nIn a separate attack in the city of Cucuta, in northeast Norte de Santander province, a Roman Catholic priest was gunned down by two unidentified killers on Wednesday evening, police said.\nHe was the third priest killed in two months -- a sign, some clergymen say, that they are increasingly caught in the crossfire of guerrilla and paramilitary violence, which has surged in recent months.\n\"The basic problem is not the lack of respect for priests but the total disregard for the value of human life,\" said Monsignor Juan Francisco Sarasti, vice president of Colombia's Episcopal Conference.", "One day after rival bidders sent its stock on a rollercoaster ride, Conrail Inc was set Tuesday to formally consider a $9 billion takeover offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\nThe company's board of directors was widely expected to reject the unsolicited Norfolk Southern offer in favor of a friendly $8.4 billion deal with CSX Corp.\n\"My guess is, at this point, that they stick with the CSX proposal,\" said Brian Routledge of Prudential Securities.  \nConrail's board was slated to meet Tuesday ahead of a Wednesday deadline to respond to the Norfolk Southern offer.\nA Conrail spokesman declined to comment on the timing of its decision, but Wall Street experts expected the company to issue an announcement on Wednesday.\nConrail agreed on Oct. 15 to be bought by CSX in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or $92.50 per share. Norfolk launched its $100-per-share bid on Oct. 23.\nSince then, Norfolk Southern and CSX have vehemently attacked each other's offers and landed in court.  \nThe CSX-Norfolk Southern relationship between took a new twist Monday when the companies announced they were holding discussions about their bids, but offered conflicting accounts about the talks. Uncertainty about those talks prompted sharp stock declines on Monday.\nIndustry experts said Conrail is likely to defend the lower CSX bid by citing the strategic benefits of the transaction and the lack of potential legal problems associated with the friendly deal. Legal expoerts have said that Pennsylvania takeover law could impede a Norfolk Southern acquisition of Conrail.  \nExperts also speculated that Conrail may try to convince CSX to sweeten its offer in an attempt to appease shareholders who may be upset by the rejection of a higher bid.\nRailroad industry experts have said that CSX likely cannot afford to match Norfolk Southern's $100 cash offer, but may be able to restructure the bid to increase the cash portion of the transaction.\n\"I think it is a strong likelihood that any positive reaction from Conrail's bid toward the Norfok Southern bid will force CSX to sweeten their bid,\" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.", "International copper prices are likely to stick to the high road for some time yet, pricing the metal out of the key China market, Far East metal traders said on Monday.\n\"The LME (London Metal Exchange) will move higher and will test US$2,100 (a tonne),\" a base metal trader in Hong Kong said.\n\"We want it to go down. $1,800 to $1,900 is workable.\"\nCopper prices on the LME rallied through the psychological barrier of US$2,000 a tonne on Friday, hitting $2,027 in late afternoon trading.\nThis rally pushed the international price above the domestic Chinese price, rendering imports senseless, traders said.\nOn the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the most active February 1997 contract opened at 19,550 yuan ($2,355) a tonne, consolidating around that level within the first half-hour.\nChina levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) on copper imports, killing margins at current prices, traders said.\nSoggy Chinese business would be further dampened, traders said. One source at a Chinese listed company said he had 200 tonnes of the red metal to sell at a premium of $100 over the LME spot price.\nThe premium on copper, CIF (cost, insurance and freight) to Hong Kong and Chinese ports, was $150 last week, traders said.\n\"We will not have any import business (with China) with such high LME prices,\" another trader in Hong Kong said. \"We are getting calls from Chinese offering copper back to the market.\"\n\"Premiums are not the issue, the total price is the concern -- and even with no premium it is difficult,\" he said.\nAmong the bears, the head of a trading house in Hong Kong bullishly noted signs the central government was attempting to stimulate the property market could see copper and aluminium users stocking up.\nCancellation of interest rate subsidies, interest rate reductions and the removal of private car purchase quotas were aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy, he said.\n\"I think the whole picture will change,\" he said.\n\"We have been waiting for a very long time and we have known they (Chinese authorities) are moving in this direction. It will restart cash flow and that will re-stimulate the economy very, very quickly,\" he said.\nHe and other traders said Chinese consumers' stocks, usually kept at one month's supply or around 100,000 tonnes, have been run down.\n\"Consumers have nothing and if they have to accumulate investory in their warehouses because of the change of sentiment, the damage to the market will disappear,\" he said.\nOther sources said the Shanghai Metal Exchange had around 15,000 tonnes of copper in stock.\nDrawdowns from LME warehouse stocks over the past couple of months indicated demand in Europe was picking up, traders said.\n\"If it continues, we will not have enough material, especially as there is no scrap around at the moment and LME stocks are down (to 145,825 tonnes),\" said the trading house boss.\n\"The situation could become critical by the end of the year,\" he said.", "French subscriber television company Canal Plus said on Friday it was merging with Nethold, a Dutch satellite television company, to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups.\nNethold is jointly held by Richemont SA, which is quoted on the Zurich and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and MIH Holdings Ltd, a listed holding company.\n\"This merger is a major strategic move, resulting in the creation of one of the largest television groups in the world...particularly in the field of pay-TV with over 8.5 million subscribers,\" Canal Plus said in a statement.\nThe new group will have significant positions in France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries and Germany as well as a presence in several growing markets in central Europe.\nThe Paris stockmarket authorities had suspended trading in Canal Plus shares on Friday morning, sparking speculation of a link up between the French firm and Nethold.\nIts stock closed at 1,169 francs on Thursday.\nUtilities group Cie Generale des Eaux, a key shareholder in Canal Plus, said in a separate statement it was delighted with the merger plan, which marked big step in Canal Plus's international development.\nThe pact would give the French company access to the fast-growing Italian market, Generale des Eaux said.\nIt would also give the new group greater weight in negotiating purchases of copyrights and open opportunities for the launch of European theme channels.\nGenerale des Eaux said it was comfortable with its investment in Canal Plus. It said that in agreement with other Canal Plus shareholders, it would seek to maintain the same scale of investment in the new company.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Canal Plus will buy 100 percent of Nethold from Richemont and MIH, paying with 6.1 million new Canal Plus shares and $45 million in cash.\nFollowing the issue of new Canal Plus shares, Richemont and MIH will respectively own 15 and five percent of Canal Plus.\nCie Financiere Richemont has interests in luxury goods and tobacco and owns such famous brandnames as Cartier, Mont Blanc, Rothmans and Dunhill.\nCanal Plus said the deal had the backing of its main shareholders, media group Havas, Generale des Eaux, bank Societe Generale, and state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations.\nIt is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.", "Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday its fiscal first quarter profit from operations rose 77 percent, reflecting strong sales of its computer networking equipment.\nThe company, which makes devices that control the flow of information between computers in a network, said earnings before gains and charges rose to $320.8 million, or 47 cents a share, for the three months ended Oct. 26, from $181.4 million or 28 cents in the same quarter a year ago.\nNet income for the quarter, after taking into account a $174.6 million charge for the acquisition of Telebit Corp. and a $55.1 million gain from the sale of a minority investment, totaled $180.9 million, or 26 cents a share, slightly lower than the year-ago figure.\nRevenues jumped 80 percent to $1.43 billion from $798.3 million.\nWall Street had expected Cisco, the world's biggest computer networking company and a bellwhether technology stock, to report a profit from operations of 46 cents, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nAnalysts said the company had a solid quarter, alleviating concerns in recent weeks about slowing sales of networking equipment.\n\"They surprised us on the revenue,\" said Eric Blachno, analyst at Bear Stearns in New York. \"It was a little higher than we thought.\"\nCisco also managed to keep its gross margins -- a measure of how much profit a company makes from each dollar of sales -- at 65 percent, better than analysts had expected.\nCisco, based in San Jose, Calif., attributed the higher profits to strong sales across all its product lines.\n\"More of our customers are beginning to look at a single vendor\" for all of their networking needs, said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.\nThe company reported its results after the market closed. For the day, the stock had gained $1.125 to close at $61.75. After the earnings release, the shares slipped 25 cents to $61.50 in after-hour trading.\nAnalysts said some investors may have been disappointed that Cisco's earnings per share were not higher. Frequently, Cisco reports per-share results that are at least 3 or 4 cents above forecasts.", "British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday.\n\"I don't think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word,\" one analyst said.\nA proposal to sell-off Greycoat's assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers.\nUK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly.\nThe South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.\nMoorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had \"developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat\".\nIt said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman.\nThey include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.\nThis would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.\nMoorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of \"investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company\".\nThe remainder of the enlarged group would constitute \"an investment, trading and development portfolio\" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by \"at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum\", Moorfield said.\nWhile analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position.\n\"But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,\" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked \"very seriously\" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.\nAnother possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.\nMyerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise \"forced sale\" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.\n\"Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,\" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties.\n\"They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,\" he added.\nBut others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. \"This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,\" the second analyst said.", "John Walter believes that making strategies work within the machinery of AT&T Corp will be the core both of his job as chief operating officer and when he steps up to become chief executive (CEO) in 1998.\n\"You can have the greatest strategy in the world, but if you dont execute, it doesnt matter,\" Walter told Reuters.\nWalter, chairman and chief executive of commercial printing firm R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co, was on Wednesday appointed by AT&T as president and chief operating officer, and heir apparent to AT&T CEO and chairman Robert Allen.  \nWalter will immerse himself in the operations of AT&T during the 14 months when he and Robert Allen work as a team, and emerge capable of holding the reins.\n\"I'm very comfortable with my ability to move this enterprise forward,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nWalter declined to outline areas where he believed AT&T had failed, but underlined achieving objectives and having an appropriate cost base as his clear focus.\n\"We have to have a cost platform which allows us to compete effectively or we are disadvantaged even before we come into the ring,\" he said.  \nAnalysts have repeatedly criticised AT&T's inability to meet its objectives, which has resulted in an erosion of the value of the brand name and a sliding share price.\nAT&T has flung tens of millions in $100 checks at consumer long distance customers only to find them desert again to rivals in the industry. Its share in the $75 billion market has fallen to around 55 percent from 60 two years ago.\n\"They haven't had the level of execution on the consumer side that we should have seen,\" said consultant Chris Landis of TeleChoice, who is also an ex-AT&T executive.  \nAT&T has made repeated attempts to make money in online services and the Internet, but has sold off almost all its creative content efforts and has retreated to a core offering of Internet access.\nFor every acquisition that worked well, like the 1994 purchase of McCaw Cellular, there have been others that failed, like the $7.5 billion 1991 takeover of NCR Corp.\nAdjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.  \nAmong Walter's favorite quotes: \"When you hire, hire people better than you and then you'll build a company of giants. Hire people worse than you and you'll disappear.\"\nPrinting industry analysts say Walter has used technology very effectively to make Donnelley grow, but some say growth came at a price.\n\"A lot of things have been going wrong,\" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price.\nBut analyst Rudolf Hokanson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said Walter was an effective manager.\n\"He tried to make people more accountable, tried to flatten some of the reporting structure,\" said Hokanson.", "Shipments of cocoa from Ivory Coast's main port of Abidjan are matching arrivals, leaving intact a standing stock of about 90,000 tonnes reported at the end of October, shipping sources said on Tuesday.\n\"The majority of transporters are shipping cocoa but some are still cautious as freight rates have not been agreed,\" one port source told Reuters. \"Total stocks have not really changed since last week,\" he added.\nPort sources said arrivals seemed to be picking up with increasing numbers of trucks arriving.\nShipping companies and exporters last week said delays in issuing freight rates and export licences had blocked some cocoa at Abidjan. Exporters now expect 1996/97 export licences to be issued this week.\n\"The Caistab (marketing board) told me licences would be out this week\" said one exporter. \"Some exporters have decided to wait for their licences and bank finances before buying anything but some are going ahead.\"\nShipping companies say they would continue shipping at the 1995/96 reference freight rates agreed with the Caistab last November.\nShipments at the start of the 1995/96 cocoa marketing season were delayed from early October to mid-November when shipping companies refused to cut their freight rates by 25 percent as requested by the Caistab. A cut of seven percent was evenutally agreed.\n\"So far we have avoided a repeat. Shipments have carried on so far but we will just wait see what happens,\" said one port source.\nRates for this year are widely expected to remain unchanged.\nShipping companies have been asked by government agencies to submit detailed information on freight rates and projected volumes for next year but say prices are confidential business information.\nCaistab spokesmen were not immediately available for comment and no date has been set for fixing the reference freight rates for the 1996/97 cocoa season.", "McDonald's Corp. on Friday reported a 10 percent rise in net income, despite a weak U.S. operating environment that was offset by growth overseas.\nThe fast-food giant, which has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide, said net income rose to $440 million from $400 million. Earnings per share gained 11 percent, with fewer shares outstanding, to 62 cents a share from 56 cents.\nEarnings for the quarter, however, were about 1 cent below what analysts had expected.\nMcDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said operating earnings in the United States fell five percent in the third quarter while company revenues rose only one percent.\n\"Our U.S. restaurants are operating in a complex, dynamic and difficult marketplace and recent operating performance has fallen short of our goals,\" Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement.\nMcDonald's said U.S. same store sales -- measuring results for units open at least one year -- were negative for both the third quarter and nine-month period.\nBut U.S. sales may be picking up, said Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes. \"I think (U.S. same store sales) are starting to hit bottom,\" Oakes said. \"Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.\"\nMcDonald's recently reorganized its management to address disappointing results in the United States.\nOutside the United States, McDonald's operating earnings grew 11 percent in the quarter as revenue jumped 13 percent.\nIt said growth in earnings was strongest in Hong Kong, England, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan. Results in Mexico remained weak due to the sluggish economy, it said.\nWhile McDonald's continues to expand its global reach, the company said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.\n\"We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996),\" McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said. \"We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year.\"\nThis would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to meet its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu, or satellite, units.\nIn 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.\nMcDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.\n\"We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991,\" Ebeling said.\nEbeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about \"600-plus\" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.\n\"We recognise we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees,\" Ebeling said.\nMerrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. \"In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty,\" Oakes said.\nEbeling said U.S. satellite units will acount for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, compared with 60 percent as originally planned.\nOverall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's total restaurant openings will still be in the United States.", "Britain's largest home loan lender, Halifax Building Society, said on Thursday it was confident of avoiding any takeover attempt when it floats on the stock market and sheds mutuality for bank status next June.\n\"We think we can stand on our own feet,\" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said.\nThe society, currently owned by its savers and borrowers, gave details of the timetable for conversion and flotation, which analysts have said could be worth 10 billion pounds ($16 billion).\nThe building society's nine million members will vote early next year on the conversion, which it is billing as the largest single extension of private share ownership in Britain.\nGilchrist said a decision to transfer its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose five-year protection against takeover but underlined its confidence.\nAnalysts said the consolidation of Britain's financial services market is likely to continue, which could make the large and successful Halifax a possible target.\nThe flotation will project the society into the top 25 companies in London's blue chip FTSE 100 stock index and Gilchrist said he was confident that shareholders would be convinced by its past performance to reject any bid attempt.\nThe concersion method raises the voting threshold needed for the plans to go ahead, but Gilchrist said he believed the necessary 50 percent of investing members entitled to vote would be met.\n\"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,\" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.\n\"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,\" Gilchrist said.\nBut members eagerly expecting to find out how big a windfall they are likely to receive when they receive free shares will have to wait until January before getting any indication.\nThe Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to and indicate their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions.\nGilchrist said members would get a \"broad idea\" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.\nHe also declined to comment on the cost of the conversion exercise. But it seems likely to provide a boon to Britain's postal service and the printing industry as well as the financial and legal advisors working on the plans.\n\"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,\" he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote \"as quickly as possible\" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.\n\"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,\" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 pounds in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.", "Misys, Britain's fast-growing, 950 million pound software supply giant, said on Wednesday it was looking at four or five international acquisition targets worth up to $30 million each.\nChairman Kevin Lomax told Reuters that Misys, which has snapped up software trading firms in South East Asia, Ireland, the U.S. and Europe, was keen on businesses that operated within a strong international financial services market.  \n\"They (possible acquisition targets) are worth mainly between $2.0 million to $30 million -- and we might do one, we might do four,\" Lomax said.\nWith 18.7 million pounds of cash and an undisclosed, but low gearing level, Lomax said the company had plently of headroom in its cash flow and borrowing facilities to enable it to embark again on the acquisition trail.\nSupplying software to banks and insurers has brought rich rewards to Misys. The group earlier raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- a 10 percent rise.  \nLomax said he saw the possibility of \"creating quite a bit of shareholder value\" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.\nMisys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to 12,000 banks and 4,000 installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.\nIn the last 12 months, its shares have almost doubled to 1115 pence from 567 pence as it systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.  \nLomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' PE ratios are comparable, he says.\nBut the stock slipped 2.5p to 1115p despite record results.\nThe company has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.\n\"Internal production is not meeting the time to market requirements that these companies have -- so they tend to look outside to other (software) products,\" Lomax says.\nOnly last month, Misys announced the planned $60 million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software.\nIn terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its next competitor.

In New York, the stock rose 37.5 cents to $26.875.\nThe market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.\nBarrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its $800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.\nBarrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below $100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.\nCapital costs should be about $200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.\n\"They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,\" Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.\nAt Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totalling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of $240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about $475 million.", "China's new hardline dictum to its people to battle hostile Western influences with puritan Marxist values underlines a poverty of ideas among an ageing leadership with declining credibility in a fast-changing society, analysts said on Monday.\n\"They don't seem to grasp that people have changed since the days when they had nothing else to do but to listen to lengthy party documents being broadcast on the radio,\" said one China analyst.\n\"Nowadays people have so many other activities they may just skim over the headlines and not bother to read something like this,\" he said, referring to a 15,000-character Communist Party document issued in official newspapers on Monday.\n\"Do the leaders not realise people can channelsurf because it's not just one television station any more?\" he said.\nChina's ruling Communist Party, in what it hailed as one of its greatest documents ever, warned against hostile Western ideas such as capitalism and parliamentary democracy, urged vigilance against pornography and profit and vowed to fight back with puritan Marxist values.\n\"If they are seeking to change the average Chinese in the street then this is not the answer,\" said one Western diplomat, describing the newest demand for ideological conformity as a rehash of communist methods practiced for years.\nChinese political analysts have warned that the inability of the communist leadership to move with the times and experiment with new ideas and methods to stir up popular support in a society rapidly being transformed by market-oriented economic reforms could have dangerous repercussions.\n\"A lot of people just aren't listening any more,\" one analyst said, adding that a consequence of this breakdown of communication would create even more distance between the populace and a leadership that is already remote and secretive.\nTo recapture popular attention, China's leaders might try to use more extreme propaganda tools, such as whipping up a potentially destabilising nationalist and anti-Western campaign, analysts said.\n\"We are looking at an ageing leadership -- many of the Politburo are in their 70s -- who are set in their ways and don't seem able to accept younger advisers trying to package acceptable ideology in new wrapping paper,\" one diplomat said.\nParamount leader Deng Xiaoping had missed an opportunity to appoint a younger leadership when he purged the upper echelons after the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, analysts and diplomats said.\nAnalysts said that while the latest communist creed tried to present itself as a balanced dictum, it was clearly intended to achieve the goal of conformity of thought.\n\"It's pretty much a blueprint for censors to do what they want,\" said one diplomat.\nEven conservative newspaper editors appointed in recent years as replacements to more liberal writers have been purged in recent weeks, a succession of books have been ordered off the shelves and popular author Wang Shuo has been effectively banned.\n\"Things are only going to get worse,\" said one analyst.\nHowever, some doubted how effective a new purge would be.\n\"It's part and parcel of an attempt to take control of the way people think and the kind of cultural afairs that are conducted,\" the western diplomat said.\n\"But people don't always take as much notice as they once did,\" he said. \"It may not last much longer than the time it takes to read the thing.\"", "The United Auto Workers union is discussing the possibility of an extended five- or six-year contract with the nation's largest automakers, UAW and company officials said Monday.\nThe union is open to the idea of a contract longer than the typical three-year pact if it offers significant job security guarantees, officials said.\n\"It has surfaced in the subcommittees,\" said Carl Dowell, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville, Ky. \"There was no problem with a longer-term agreement if it's fruitful for our people. Job security is the key.\"\nContract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen.\nThe UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a \"strike target\" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies.\nA UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week.\nTraditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14.\nFord spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract.\nHe said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. \"It gives you more of a known quantity,\" he said.\nYokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers \"want to buy it.\"\nHowever, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers.\n\"The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?\" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant.\nSuch an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said.\nGM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs.\n\"You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,\" McNulty said.", "U.S. computer hardware makers are expected to report mixed results for the third quarter starting this week, as some companies are still in the throes of product transitions, but a few will have solid earnings.\nAmong the large system makers, International Business Machines Corp is expected to have good results, but Digital Equipment Corp is expected to report a loss.\n\"Product transitions and U.S. strength, those are some issues for the third quarter,\" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst.  \nCurrency will play less of a role than it has in the past two quarters, when it has had a negative impact on earnings, especially at multi-national giants like IBM.\n\"The negative impact from currency exchange rates is much reduced from June-quarter results,\" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, referring to large computer systems makers.\nEurope is still an issue for some companies, such as Digital, and this quarter will include the sluggish summer month of August, when many Europeans are on vacation.\n\"They (Digital) have significant exposure to Europe,\" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.  \nMilunovich said that Digital has more exposure in Europe, which has been \"a bit under water,\" than IBM. Digital recently revamped its sales force in Europe and made changes in its distribution channel there, to help sluggish European sales.\nProduct transitions are still ongoing at some companies, such as Unisys Corp and Silicon Graphics Inc.\nIBM has now completed a refresh of most of its hardware products, including its lower-cost mainframe line, the CMOS vesions of its System 390 mainframes and analysts are awaiting results of the first quarter to include any impact from the much-anticipated systems.  \n\"We expect IBM to highlight the success of its CMOS mainframes,\" Jones of Salomon said.\nIn the personal computer arena, analysts expect Compaq Computer Corp to again be the leader of the sector, but they do not expect a record quarter for the world's largest PC maker. Its strongest sales are in fourth quarter.\n\"I think the company had a good quarter and they probably gained market share,\" said Bill Milton of Brown Brothers Harriman, adding that it was a \"so-so quarter\" for the rest of the PC industry. Compaq has the highest profit margins in the industry and Milton said its margins should be up slightly.  \nAmong the weaker players in PCs, Apple Computer Inc is expected to report a loss, but analysts said they are more focused on the company's comments going forward. The troubled PC maker has previously forecast that it would return to profitability in its second fiscal quarter, ending March.\n\"Their first order of priority is to eliminate the losses,\" Milton said. \"Can they reach break-even by December or March?

Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.\nThe strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or fertilizer that includes steer manure.\nHealth officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.\n\"Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,\" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.\nAlthough so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.\nOdwalla, which bills itself as the \"leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,\" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.\nIn the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million.

Chrysler executives have suggested in the past they want to phase out the automaker's production arrangement with Mitsubishi.\nRichard Recchia, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi's U.S. unit, said in October 1995 the future relationship between the two companies would likely be based more on a partnership of components and engineering exchanges instead of complete products.\nThat is apparently changing.\nAutomotive News, a weekly trade publication, reported Monday that Chrysler Executive Vice President Thomas Gale took a team of executives to Tokyo in November to meet with Mitsubishi officials about extending the current contract through 2004.\nWilliams would not comment on the meeting. Gail O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi's Normal plant, said discussions with Chrysler have been continuing, with Mitsubishi considering numerous options.\n\"Talks have been ongoing, which is totally understandable based on the fact that the contract is coming up,\" she said. Analysts said it would make sense for Chrysler to continue to use Mitsubishi as a production partner.\nSince coupe sales have fallen off in recent years, Chrysler could use its own manufacturing resources to build products where it has a greater competitive edge, such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an industry consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"This way they can steer development dollars to some of their other platforms,\" he said.\nMoreover, if Chrysler were to move Avenger and Sebring coupe production out of the Normal plant, it would most likely have to convert its plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently builds the popular Sebring convertible, Neon, Cirrus and Stratus cars, analysts have said.\nRobinet also noted that Mitsubishi would benfit from keeping Chrysler as a production customer. Although the Normal plant has capacity to make at least 240,000 vehicles a year, this year it is only expected to make 184,000 units, he said. Next year, the plant is forecast to produce 175,000 units.\nIn addition to the Avenger, Sebring and Talon, the plant makes the Galant sedan and Eclipse coupes for Mitsubishi.\nAccording to Automotive News, Chrysler's products have accounted for 45 percent of the 177,707 units produced through November.\nChrysler was a 50-50 partner with Mitsubishi when the Normal plant, originally called Diamond Star Motors, was founded in 1985. In 1993, Chrysler sold its ownership stake back to Mitsubishi.\nLast year, Chrysler said it would drop the Dodge Stealth sports car from its 1996 model year line up because of slumping sales. Mitsubishi made the Stealth and imported it from Japan. The two companies continue to supply each other with engines.", "The head of war-torn Chechnya's oil company said on Thursday that Russia's rebellious region would guarantee the safety of a major oil pipeline across its land but demanded a cut in foreign deals that will use the link.\nKhozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company, which is based in the devastated capital Grozny, told a news conference that an $8 billion multinational consortium that will use the link to export oil in 1997 should not worry because the pipeline was safe and sound.\n\"We guarantee the link's safety,\" he said. \"But remember that with pipelines all over the world, things sometimes happen -- sabotage, technical errors, human errors.\"\nHe said Chechnya should get a cut from transit fees via the so-called northern link, which can carry 17 million tonnes of oil a year.\n\"The Chechen part is approximately in the same condition as the rest of the link,\" he said, referring to the stretch running through Grozny and linking the Azeri capital Baku to Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk.\nThe 13 international oil companies in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company plan to reverse the flow of the pipeline to ship up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of early oil from their Caspian offshore projects near Baku from August 1997.\nThe consortium is led by an alliance of British Petroleum Plc and Norway's Statoil.\nProtracted bloodshed and instability in the 21-month Chechen conflict have given the consortium the jitters ever since Moscow sent troops into Grozny in December 1994 in a bloody bid to rein in the breakaway region.\nThe oil firms, worried that exports from their big ticket investments could fall prey to a separatist war, have access to a second export route via the former Soviet republic of Georgia.\nUnderscoring the fragility of the region for oil investors, six foreigners working with the International Committee of the Red Cross were shot dead at a Chechen hospital on Wednesday and six ethnic Russians were killed on Thursday.\nYarikhanov, who said he had faced a cool reception at Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly, which owns and operates the pipeline, and at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, said Moscow was not doing enough to resurrect the region's once-glorious oil sector.\nWhile he said the pipeline was no worse for the war, Chechnya's production and refining facilities had been laid waste.\nAt least eight trillion roubles ($1.44 billion) were needed to bring the facilities back on line. Yarikhanov said financing could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya.\n\"We want our share of profits from the transport of oil across our country,\" he said, adding the Azeri group would pay $16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near Baku to Novorossiisk.\nThe Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir.\nThe Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into bloodshed.\nChechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow began tapping its massive Siberian reserves.\nRefining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22 million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased.", "Heavy losses in metals trading by a young employee at big Chinese conglomerate CITIC showed striking similarities to Nick Leeson's deals that humbled Barings Bank, a top CITIC official said.\nCITIC -- the China International Trust and Investment Corp -- had learned a bitter lesson from the 1994 losses and had stepped up its internal controls, group executive director Chang Zhenming said in an interview.\n\"There were a lot of similarities,\" Chang said of the CITIC and Barings episodes.\n\"We realised the seriousness of risk,\" he said.\nCITIC has gained a reputation of being one of China's best run companies, expanding its operations to power, telecommunications, banking and real estate. It is probably best known for its Hong Kong-listed unit, CITIC Pacific.\nIts big losses in 1994 were all the more surprising to many foreign businessmen.\nThe key figure in CITIC's trading was Chen Tongsheng, in his early 30's, who worked at the CITIC Shanghai office.\nLike Leeson, who was 28 when his big losses on Singapore's SIMEX exchange emerged, Chen was not a university graduate.\nHe had worked his way through to his trading position, taking a post as a bank clerk after finishing high school.\nAlso like Leeson, he is now in jail -- along with his supervisor, the former president of the Shanghai operation.\n\"Not only was the background of the trader similar (to Leeson) but so were the trading methods as well.\"\nChang said that losses stemmed from unauthorised trades on the London Metals Exchange, and that broker credits compounded the problem.\n\"He didn't have any money. He used LME broker credits,\" said Chang of the Shanghai trader.\nAsked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: \"You could say it was exactly the same.\"\nAuditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.\nBut unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson's, which neared $1.4 billion.\nChang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.\n\"We have stepped up our internal controls,\" he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo's copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.\nCITIC's subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.\nCITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.\nAsked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.", "Shanghai city is on the verge of renting out the former Hongkong & Shanghai Bank building on the riverside Bund to an unnamed bank but definitely not the Hongkong Bank, a senior official said on Wednesday.\nThe official, Zhou Jinbao, said final negotiations were in progress with two or three contenders for the huge building, built in 1925 as a symbol of the financial might of the British Empire.\n\"I will invite you to the signing ceremony. It will be held very soon,\" Zhou, general manager of the Bund Buildings Transformation Corp, said in an interview. \"The basic issues have now been basically agreed upon.\"\nHe declined to say which companies were in the final running but said he expected the winner to be a bank.\n\"It is not the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,\" he added.\nThe Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, had more than two years of discussions with Shanghai city officials on terms for resuming control of their former headquarters but finally announced that they had decided not to proceed with the proposal.\nZhou said the Hongkong Bank had wanted to demolish several buildings behind the main structure and erect a modern office tower.\nBut he said this proposal would have had an impact on wider development plans for the area which have not yet been fixed and are unlikely to be finalised for at least another year or two.\nThe main building has 24,000 square metres of space and Zhou said he was looking at around three U.S. dollars per square metre per day in rental. The lease can be for any period up to 30 or 40 years.\n\"The rental fee we are looking for is based on the fact the Bund should be the highest priced piece of land (in Shanghai). If other buildings are currently renting for two dollars a day (per square metre), then this building should be three dollars,\" he said.\nAt that price, the monthly rental fee for the building would be over $2 million per month. Renovation costs, he estimated, would cost around $15 million.\nThe building is steeped in history. After serving in effect as the East Asian financial headquarters of western imperialism for a quarter of century, it became after 1949 the Communist Party's Shanghai headquarters and city hall.\nThe city officials finally moved into a new building last year, leaving the old bank empty and echoing, waiting for a new tenant.\nThe main banking hall, with its magnificent marble pillars and curved glass roof, has had its banking counters removed and the murals which adorned the main domed entrance hall have been painted over.\nThe room just off the hall which served as the bank's general manager's office and later the office of a succession of Shanghai city Communist Party chiefs, is small and airless.\n\"This building has not only huge architectural value, but also great cultural and historical significance,\" said Zhou. \"That is why we will only rent it. We will not sell it. It is a treasure.\"", "Even before the personal computer era's foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry's annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.\nAlthough the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year's show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.\nThe week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.\nThe latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.\nNot only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.\nAlthough the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.\n\"I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision,\" Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.\nSony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.\nThe opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp.

A spokesman said the device contained just a few ounces (under 100 grams) of explosive and was probably simply intended to sow panic.\nAt least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to march organisers.\nNational Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.\n\"When you're abducted you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,\" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.\nSantos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.\nIn a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.\nThe women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.\nAn estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march.

Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said at a press conference both sides were \"happy\" with the deal, which has been completed.\nRewey said Ford, which occupies about 650,000 square feet in two of the center's four towers, had planned to stay in its location through 2005 when its leases expire.\n\"Our plans got changed -- by the new landlord,\" he said.\nMost of the employees, who work in the Ford, Lincoln-Mercury and Customer Service Divisions, will be relocated to Ford's existing Regent Court building near the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.\nRewey said Ford was not pressured by GM to leave early, but decided to do so because it now has space to relocate workers as a result of its ongoing Ford 2000 reorganization.\nRewey declined to say if GM will pay any of Ford's relocation costs. Those expenses could be substantial because Ford's customer assistance and business assistance centres are computer-intensive, technically sophisticated operations.\nEmployees will begin moving by mid-1997 and should be out of the Renaissance Centre by the end of 1998.\nFearing his urban revitalisation efforts could be hurt, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer had encouraged Ford to stay in downtown Detroit. But Rewey said Ford could not find a suitable downtown location that would allow it to replicate the efficiencies it now enjoys at the Renaissance Centre.\nHe noted Ford is encouraging its outside advertising agencies and accounting suppliers to remain in Detroit.\nFord officials took pains Tuesday to point out the company remains committed to the resurgence of Detroit. Included in that is a $25 million renovation of the former Veterans Memorial Building late next summer that will serve as the new UAW-Ford Training Centre.\nIn October, Ford agreed to pay $40 million for naming rights to a new downtown stadium for the Detroit Lions professional football team.\nBut some local real estate observers said Ford's decision to leave Detroit does not bode well for the city, which is losing a long-time and prominent tenant. Even though GM will fill the space Ford is vacating, there is still a surplus of class A office space, said Joel Feldman, a broker and market analyst at Friedman Real Estate Group Inc. in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"It lessens the possibility that current vacant class A space will be able to fill up, and the spill-over effect on class B office space is diminished because of this,\" he said.\nFord's history with the Renaissance Centre dates back to 1972 when then Chairman Henry Ford II announced the Renaissance Centre development project, which was designed to attract business and employment that would lead to the revitalisation of downtown Detroit.\nFord said its 35,000-square-foot World of Ford exhibition and display area at Renaissance Centre will be discontinued in June 1997. Company officials said they are not sure where or how the exhibit, which is popular with marketing and sales workers, will be reconstructed.", "World-wide Australian transport group TNT Ltd reported another annual profit slump on Wednesday, but promised the sale of its troubled airline and other reforms would produce strong profit growth in current year.\n\"We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,\" TNT managing director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.\nTNT's net profit for the year to June 30 fell to A$9.84 million (US$7.79 million) from A$40.01 million in 1994/95 and A$105.05 million in 1993/94.\nMortimer said a sharp drop profits from Australia's Ansett Airlines, 50 percent owned by TNT, and losses from its Brazilian operations and local general freight business offset good revenue growth in TNT's core operations.\nHe said profits from these core activities of domestic and international time-sensitive freight and logistics had grown 48.7 percent to A$165.3 million in 1995/96.\nTNT had moved to excise these loss-making units and focus on profitable core activities, he said.\n\"We've dealt with the (Australian) LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed, and we've sold Brazil,\" he said.\n\"What's the saying.... when in doubt shoot it or fix it.\"\nTNT would also look to sell other unprofitable, non-core businesses, Mortimer said. \"We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform, then they will be vulnerable to sale\n\"The inconsistency in our results has come from these fringe activities...it's that volatility around the earnings base that says we have to concentrate on core activities and get out of the non-core'riff-raff,' if you like,\" he said.\nEarlier this week TNT announced the finalisation of plans to sell its stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd for cash receipts of A$325 million. The other 50 percent of Ansett is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.\nTNT's remaining non-core activities include an airline leasing company jointly owned with News Corp, some shipping operations between New Zealand and Australia, a mono-rail in Sydney and some information technology assets.\nMortimer would not single out any of these as potential immediate sale prospects, but said they were vulnerable while they were not making profits.\nHe said the airline leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide, needed to have its capital base restructured before it could be sold.\nShareholders, however, took the profit slump in their stride, having actually forecast a slight loss rather than a slight profit.\nNet profit before abnormals, but after preference dividends, fell to A$0.6 million from A$38.48 million in 1994/95.\nAnalysts had expected a pre-abnormal, post preferences loss of between A$4 million and A$22 million.\nTNT's shares closed up three cents at A$1.47.", "Database software company Informix Corp. said Friday it filed a lawsuit against Oracle Corp., accusing its bigger rival of stealing trade secrets by hiring away its employees.\nOracle hired 11 Informix employees from Informix's Portland, Ore., research and development centre. All 11 workers quit on Wednesday morning, said Informix Chief Executive Phil White.\nInformix stock fell $1.50, or 6.6 percent, to $21.375 in active trading on Nasdaq. Oracle stock fell 87.5 cents to $39.625, also on Nasdaq.\n\"This is a blatant effort by Oracle,\" said White. \"They're behind significantly technically. We're not going to let someone who's significantly behind technically just buy his way in.\"\nOracle officials called the lawsuit \"ridiculous\" and said the 11 programmers approached Oracle on their own. They also had approached Microsoft Corp. about jobs, said Jerry Held, Oracle senior vice president of server technologies.\n\"This is a group of senior developers that was very frustrated by the lack of vision of Informix top managers,\" Held said. \"We did no active recruiting. I was called absolutely out of the blue\" when the former Informix staff joined Oracle.\nThe lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Oregon Circuit Court in Portland, seeks unspecified damages. Informix on Thursday also obtained a temporary injunction barring the former employees from giving trade secrets to Oracle, Informix said.\nInformix also charged Gary Kelley, a former Informix product development vice president who left for Oracle, with breach of contract. Kelley did not return phone calls to Oracle's Portland facility.\nInformix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and Oracle, based 20 miles north in Redwood Shores, Calif., both write sophisticated programmes that store and retrieve huge amounts of information in corporate computer networks.\nThe companies for years have been fighting a marketing war touting their advances in database technology with each new release of their respective flagship products.\nWhite said he believed Oracle was interested in gaining Informix's expertise in writing software for so-called massively parallel computers -- top-of-the-line machines that can process huge amounts of transactions simultaneously.\nThe 11 Informix employees who left for Oracle were working on this type of product, White said.\nHeld said Oracle does not have an interest in Informix's technology because Oracle is ahead in that area.\n\"Oracle has had parallel technology for years,\" Held said. \"Informix is playing catch-up. Phil has a knack for being behind and saying he's ahead.\"\nTechnology debates aside, the spat is the most serious between the companies in years. White, normally a publicity-shy executive, said he was livid about Oracle's tactics and intended to make the lawsuit a political cause in Silicon Valley for preventing employee raids.\nWhite said he personally went to the home of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Thursday night to discuss the issue, but Ellison was in Hong Kong. Both men live in the same small town in Silicon Valley.\n\"I'm doing this not only for Informix and for our shareholders but also for the industry,\" White said. \"We can't let companies come in and throw big financial incentives and walk away with intellectual property we spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing.\"\nIn recent years, several software rivals in Silicon Valley have accused each other of trade secret theft by employee snatching.\nIn 1992, Borland International Inc. accused a former employee of sending confidential electronic mail to new employer Symantec Corp... Last year, Cadence Design Systems Inc... filed a similar charges against direct competitor Avant Corp..\nThe court has set a hearing in the Informix case for Feb. 7.", "Supermarket group Budgens Plc said on Monday that it expected to open 10 new wholly-owned stores in 1997, as well as continuing to build up its presence on petrol station forecourts.\nIn a telephone interview with Reuters after the company announced an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 5.04 million stg, chief executive John von Spreckelsen said the group continued to be \"well-placed as a small operator in this niche where we are complementary to the superstores and the discounters.\"  \n\"The successful companies will continue to take market share from the less successful ones,\" he said.\nBudgens saw sales rise by 8.1 percent to 183.0 million stg in the 28 weeks to November, while on a like-for-like basis they climbed 4.5 percent.\nSpreckelsen said that sales growth in the run-up to Christmas slowed down as large stores pulled in trade, but had picked up again in January.\nShares in the group were virtually unchanged after the results, trading just 1/4 pence higher at 46 1/2 in early dealing on Monday.", "If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.\nThe Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.  \nThe section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.\nBoth the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  \nIn the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.\n\"Now the tables have been turned,\" Litan said. \"But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.\"  \nBoth moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.\nIn the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, \"is not material.\" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.\nCompetitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.\nComptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary \"basically eliminates any subsidization.\"\nHe opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. \"It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,\" he said.", "Toronto, Canada's biggest city and financial capital, is bracing for a near shutdown Friday when protesters hit the streets against deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.\nThe so-called \"Days of Protest\" on Friday and Saturday are shaping up to be the biggest labour protest in Canada since the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919 in which one person died and 30 were injured after a confrontation with police and the army.\nIn a bid to paralyse this city of 2.2 million people, organisers hope to close businesses and disrupt services, including underground trains and Toronto's Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport.\nThousands of unionized workers, civil servants and activists will picket outside the Toronto Stock Exchange, government offices, corporate headquarters and factories.\n\"I must tell you to prepare for days of inconvenience and frustration Friday and Saturday,\" Alan Tonks, chairman of Metro Toronto, said in a letter to residents on Thursday.\nIronically, the labour chaos comes as Toronto basks in the glow of being chosen by Fortune magazine as the world's best city for quality of life.\nThe protesters are furious with the government's plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.\nSince sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.\n\"We want to put pressure on the government and its corporate supporters that we're not going to accept this anymore,\" Linda Torney, co-chairwoman of the \"Days of Protest\", said in a telephone interview.\nPremier Mike Harris, who has been dubbed \"Newt of the North\" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, vowed the protests will not stall his \"Common Sense Revolution.\"\nCity officials were bracing for a disruption of Toronto's bus and subway services, which handle about 1 million commuters a day. Transit officials on Thursday won a partial injunction against picketing at subway stations.\nGO Transit, the train service that links suburban communities to Toronto, warned commuters that \"service may be delayed, adjusted, interrupted or even cancelled.\"\nAir travellers can also expect delays at Pearson Airport, which handles about 65,000 passengers a day, said airport spokesman Bruce Reid.\nA Canadian court ruled Wednesday that picketers cannot interfere with essential airport workers, but can set up informational pickets. Airlines have promised to re-schedule flights if there are significant delays.\nMeanwhile, several major manufacturers have cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday.\nThe protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week.\nThe Breeders' Cup, a major international horse-racing event on Saturday, will not be affected by the protest.\nOn Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community, traders not lucky enough to get a scarce hotel room are planning to sleep in their offices.\n\"Some essential people will be in the office. They might grab a couch or a sleeping bag,\" one broker said.\nOther firms are sending their employees to offices outside Toronto or telling them to work from home. Many workers are expected to take the day off.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest stock exchange, is planning a \"business-as-usual day,\" despite a large rally planned outside the exchange.", "General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.\nSpeaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.\n\"GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,\" said Licari.\nAt stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.\nUAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.\nBoth Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.\nBargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.\nBowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.\n\"I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,\" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. \"GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.\"\nGM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.\nIn settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the sale of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource more products.\nYokich has not said what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. He set the deadline on Friday, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.\nHowever, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if not enough progress had been made by the deadline. By hitting light truck plants such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wis., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.\nGM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.", "British Telecommuncations Plc, the telecoms giant, beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.\nBT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the second quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.\nBut after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) redundancy charge and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below figures for the same periods in 1995.\n\"The results for the half year show an encouraging position with sustained high growth in demand for our telephony services and significant sales increases in our new markets and advanced products,\" said chairman Sir Iain Vallance.\nBT, whose shares jumped 8.5 pence to 369 pence in heavy trade, has managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines over the last 12 months despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.\nThe group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.\n\"We're growing, we're not going backwards,\" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.\n\"I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world...When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.\"\nBT, which has formed six joint ventures worth $135 billion to gain access to the European markets, said it planned to \"get very aggressive\" in the next two years as the continental telecoms markets are opened up to competition, around 1998.\nAsked where BT saw the main profit growth, Brace said:\n\"All prices in France and Germany are very high compared with the UK. If markets open up and we compete, prices will come down. But we will take substantial market share, particularly in the business area where quality of service really matters.\"\nBT has operations in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. The firm, which cut another 3,200 staff in the first half of this year, expects about the same number of voluntary redundancies in the second.\nAs part of its European offensive, BT has won a licence in the Netherlands, plans to win both fixed and mobile licences in Germany and has bought into a mobile licence in France where it also thinks it will win the second fixed licence.\nBrace said high-speed digital ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines and overseas operations were growing at about 50-100 percent per year and that the company had high hopes for its intranet initiative with software giant Microsoft Corp, where it also sees booming demand.\nBT said on Wednesday that it and MCI, whose proposed merger is the biggest transatlantic deal in history, were linking up with Microsoft to offer transnational firms private communications networks based on the internet.\nAsked whether BT, which announced its $20 billion merger with MCI on November 3, planned similar deals, Brace said few other large communications groups offered the same prospects.\n\"I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with.\"\nAs previously announced, BT is raising its interim dividend by six percent to 7.9 pence. As part of the MCI deal, BT is also paying a special dividend of 35 pence which it expects to pay in September 1997 at the same time as the final dividend.", "St George Bank Ltd announced on Monday an agreed A$2.65 billion merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd - its fifth merger attempt in the past two years.\nThe merger of the two Sydney-based regional banks would create Australia's fifth largest bank, with assets of A$40 billion and a market capitalisation of A$4.5 billion, making its of Australia's top 25 listed companies.  \nAnalysts said the plan for Advance to pay St George A$100 million if it were taken over by a third party was seen as a way to ward off other bids, making it look like it was fifth time lucky for the St George.\n\"I think that would make it unattractive for somebody else to come in and make a bid,\" said Linda Lyon, banking analyst at brokers BNP Equities.\nSt George said it would offer an effective A$7.30 for each share in Advance Bank.  \nAdvance shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20 cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank.\nSt George said the total value of the offer was A$7.30 per share, representing a 20 percent increase over the average Advance Bank share price over the previous five trading days.\nAdvance shareholders will also receive Advance Bank's interim dividend, expected to be 20 cents, payable in February.\nSt George said it would also raise A$360 million in a new capital raising to help fund the bid. The issue would proceed upon completion of the acquisition, expected to in April.  \nSt George said the merger was driven by the need to lower costs and a review had found the merger could achieve a reduction of 15 percent in annual combined expenses or A$140 million before tax.\nAdvance shares soared over 10 percent on the announcement.\nAnalysts said that although there would be cost savings, the price was still fairly generous.\n\"My initial reaction is that it looks like Advance Bank shareholders are coming out of the deal quite well, whereas St George shareholders are coming out not so well,\" said one Sydney-based banking analyst.  \n\"It's a big price. I can't imagine anybody else coming and topping the price St George is offering,\" said BNP's Lyon.\nAnalysts said the offer valued Advance at 2.8 times net asset backing, well above the 2.0 times asset backing level at which recent Australian bank merger prices had been based.\nSt George has been desperate to have a friendly merger as it is seen as a takeover target itself.\nAustralia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), holds a 6.8 percent stake in St George.\nNAB has said it has no takeover plans for St George.  \nAnalysts said the Wallis inquiry into Australia's finance and banking sector might put NAB's acquisition plans on hold until the inquiry reported its findings in March.\nSt George's bid for Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped its offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC). Last year, St George was foiled in its merger bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd when Westpac Banking Corp made a higher offer.  \nSt George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd, before the Bank of Scotalnd Ltd took control, and the Bank of South Australia, which was takeover by Advance early 1995.\nSt George shares plunged after the announcement.\nAt 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) Advance Bank shares were 69 cents or 10.99 percent higher at A$6.97 while St George shares were 40 cents or 4.47 percent down at A$8.55.", "Derek Pretty, finance director of troubled U.K. discount supermarket chain Kwik Save, said on Thursday a radical shake-up of the group, including the closure of 107 stores at a cost of 87.5 million stg, was the best way to ensure its future.\n\"We researched opportunities in other areas and we reviewed, among other options, mergers. We looked at whether we should go back to being a limited range discounter, with much lower choice, and little in terms of chilled food,\" he told Reuters.\n\"But that would have meant losing nine million customers.\"  \nHe said the store closure programme would involve less than 200 job losses, as 90 percent of the staff would be redeployed in Kwik Save's remaining 900 stores.\nAbout 1,900 work in the 107 stores to be shut. \"Yes, we are confident that the provisioning is solid and appropriate. Anything more than that would have put us in the realms of big baths and contigency buckets.\"\n\"We have looked at this particularly carefully, the days of doing big bath provisioning have gone. We have looked very specifically at the stores we plan to close. We are confident it is the proper provision to take us forward.\" he said.  \nAt a news conference chief executive Graeme Bowler said the company would introduce a new range of chilled foods, health and beauty products and over the counter medicines as well as widening its existing product range.\n\"We are going for width rather than depth in brands,\" he said. Kwik Save will have 100 own-label products in its stores from the spring 1997.\n\"We are not moving away from discounting prices. It is our core proposition and we will not dilute it,\" said Bowler. \"We are not trying to be a mini-version of someone else, we want to be ourselves.\"  \n\"Kwik Save made its reputation because it sold quality products cheaply. We will not engage in selling cheap products cheaply,\" Bowler told reporters.\nStores will also be upgraded after research conducted by outside consultants Anderson Consulting, initiated in February, showed customers wanted stores to be more welcoming and easy to use, said Bowler.\nKwik Save would need to invest heavily in technology, where it was about two to three years behind the competition, said Bowler, so that, for instance, debit cards could be used at all its tills and stock levels could be better controlled.  \nHe acknowledged that the group had failed to invest enough in upgrading the fabric of its stores in previous years.\nThe new-style Kwik Save stores will be rolled out in geographical clusters over the next three years at a cost of some 300 million stg, funded from cost savings.\nThe 107 stores will be closed progressively next year.\nResearch had identified the need to beef up the management team and as a result Kwik Save has appointed a group marketing director and a supply chain director, and planned to appoint a new buying director, Bowler said.  \nHe stressed the underlying performance of the group remained strong, generating sales of seven billion stg over the last two years despite fierce price pressure from superstores, and a return on capital of 20 percent in line with the industry average.", "Shares in debt-mired Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA fell on Tuesday after they were requoted following a week's suspension amid disappointment over terms of its restructuring with creditor banks.\nThe troubled Anglo-French company unveiled on Monday details of the refinancing its 69.6 billion francs ($13.50 billion) of junior-ranked bank debt after a year of complex negotiations with bank lenders.\nThe shares closed down 8.74 percent at 8.35 francs on heavy volume of 20 million shares. They were at 9.15 francs when they were suspended on September 30 in the runup to the debt deal.\nAnalyst Jean Borgeix at broker Pinatton said the stock market was disappointed with the 10.40 franc price that banks will be getting new Eurotunnel shares at as part of an eight billion franc equity-for-debt deal.\nThe market had been looking for a conversion price of between 12-15 francs per share, he said.\nCurrent shareholders also stand to effectively \"lose\" 30 percent of Eurotunnel's future cashflow, as this is the percentage earmarked for paying the \"stabilisation notes\" it would issue to banks in return for an interest-free credit line.\nThe company negotiated the right to issue the stabilisation notes in case it fell short of cash to meet interest payments. It can issue up to 14.8 billion francs of the notes.\nFactoring in that loss of future cashflow gave the shares a present value of around 8.5 francs a share.\nAnother French analyst said: \"The restructuring assures the industrial viability of the project, even though the shares remain a risky investment.\"\nThe debt deal looked good on paper and the zero-interest stabilisation notes provided Eurotunnel with a last line of defence if its cash failed to meet interest payments, he said.\nA trader at a major U.S. brokerage in Paris said the share price suffered from the dilution of equity due to the debt pact.\nThe restructuring will dilute the holdings of current shareholders to 54.5 percent of the capital after the debt swap.\nThe complex agreement also includes issuing eight billion francs of bonds redeemable in shares, which could further dilute the equity holders to 39.4 percent if the banks exercised their conversion rights at 12.40 francs per share.", "A U.S. appeals court in St. Louis is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to reactivate or throw out a major Federal Communications Commission order opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.\nLawyers and analysts predict the FCC and its long-distance phone company allies will lose the latest battle to GTE Corp., the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators who want to overturn the order. It spells out how new entrants to the local phone business can link to Bell local networks.\nThe appeals court suspended the FCC order in October, pending Friday's case. \"The FCC faces a tough uphill battle,\" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. \"This case is headed for the Supreme Court.\"\nAs a result, the FCC's \"interconnection\" order is likely to hang in legal limbo for at least a year while it is fought over in court -- a prospect analysts expect will cloud the phone industry's outlook and weigh on phone company stocks.\n\"It adds to the uncertainty out there,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.\nThe order was meant to implement the 1996 communications law, which allowed local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others into each other's business.\nThe appeals court, in suspending the order, sided with the local carriers and state regulators who charged that the FCC overstepped its power by issuing national rules on pricing and other matters instead of leaving those issues to the states.\nThe court wrote that opponents \"have a better than even chance of convincing the court the the FCC's pricing rules conflict with the plain meaning\" of the 1996 law.\nWith the order expected to remain on ice for a while, lawyers and analysts said state regulators and federal judges will have the chief job of prying open local phone monopolies to long-distance companies such as AT&T Corp. and others.\nFCC Chairman Reed Hundt warned that piecemeal deregulation -- with judges around the nation ultimately deciding terms for opening local phone markets -- would have a \"very negative impact\" on industry efforts to raise capital.\nFCC officials have said the case will not be resolved before the high court until spring 1998, at the earliest.\nThe order requires the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at discounts of up to 25 percent.\nThe FCC also ordered local carriers to \"unbundle\" their local networks into pieces -- such as call-switching devices and operator and directory assistance -- so new competitors can lease components to complete their own networks.\nThe \"unbundled elements\" were to be priced at competitive levels based on the cost of new and more-efficient facilities.\nIn the meantime, state regulators have been issuing decisions on terms for opening the local markets. FCC Chairman Hundt said that despite the suspension of his agency's order, 29 of 31 states so far have adopted the FCC pricing policies.\nBut even those decisions are being challenged. GTE Corp. in particular, as well as AT&T, have appealed some of those rulings to federal courts around the country.\nHenry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, blamed the legal morass on Congress, saying lawmakers \"botched\" the job of writing the 1996 law. \"The whole idea was that the courts weren't going to be determining this,\" he said.", "China's top securities watchdog on Monday issued new requirements for exchanges and securities houses to strengthen risk control with the aim of cooling its over-heated domestic A share markets.\nBut the markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen responded with fresh rises in active trading with the A share indices hitting new 1996 highs, and analysts said the warnings would have little impact on the current active trading.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in a circular, ordered the two stock exchanges to investigate the risk control mechanisms of their members, the Shanghai Securities News reported.\nAll securities houses must now display in their business halls warnings about the risks of trading on the stock markets, the circular said.\n\"The exchanges must quickly organise several groups to investigate the risk control systems of their members and report the results to the CSRC,\" it said.\nIt also ordered designated newspapers and magazines to report more on the risks of stock investment.\n\"Any comments on stock markets must avoid encouraging speculation in order to prevent investors being misguided,\" it added.\nThe new instructions follow dramatic surges on the domestic A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year.\nBeijing announced a new positive policy towards the stock markets in April, and since then Shanghai's A share market has risen more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart more than 250 percent.\nBy the end of November, China had 20 million retail investors in stocks, double the number at the end of 1995, according to media reports.\n\"The central government is concerned about surges on the markets which might be out of control,\" said Yuan Ji, an A share trader with China Guotai Securities. \"It hopes the markets will rise more steadily.\"\nThe surges apparently have been beyond the expectations of the securities authorities and, to cool the over-heated markets, the CSRC has over the past few weeks issued a series of new rules and punished many brokerages for irregularities.\nBut, despite the fresh warnings, Shanghai's A share index hit a new 1996 high of 1,312.295 points in the morning session on Monday and its Shenzhen counterpart a high of 486.22.\n\"Investors believe the authorities do not want to depress the markets, but are just worried over prices rising too fast,\" said a trader with a major Chinese brokerage. \"Because of this belief, the new warnings will have only a slight impact.\"\nThe CSRC in the circular also ordered local securities authorities to ensure the securities institutions have displayed the information by January.", "Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a crop analyst said on Thursday.\n\"We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help,\" another local crop analyst told Reuters.\nDistribution of rains was patchy.\nMost fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around Man, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coastal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.\n\"The front (associated with rain) is now over central areas,\" said one weather analyst. \"Central areas have seen a surplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit,\" he added.\nOne crop analyst told Reuters rains seemed to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.\n\"There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas,\" said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. \"There is no dust on most bush tracks.\"\nDry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had now retreated northwards after failing to reach southern Ivory Coast as usually expected in late-December or early January.\nExporters and crop inspectors said cocoa humidity levels remained around 8-10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent, despite drying efforts\nCoffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activity remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.\nQuality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.\nThe data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of January in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan:\nDalao 47.5 mm, Gagnoa 7.8 mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 6.2 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 4.6 mm, Yamoussoukro 44.8 mm, Aidjan 6 mm, Sassandra n/a, Adiake n/a, Korhogo 0 mm.\nNo data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.", "Hong Kong has arrived at the brink of history, set to name its first Chinese leader after a century and a half of British colonial rule.\nAt a gathering to be held under the red flag of communist-ruled China, Hong Kong's rich and mighty will meet on Wednesday to pick the first post-colonial leader -- and the smart money is on shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa.\nThe vote by a 400-member Chinese-controlled Selection Committee, slammed by critics as a travesty of democracy, was viewed by most in Hong Kong as a foregone conclusion.\nA survey by Hong Kong University showed 82.2 percent expected Tung to win, while 43.4 percent of respondents would back him if they had the chance to vote. His nearest rival, Ti Liang Yang, would get 27.9 percent of popular support.\nSovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.\nThe winner of Wednesday's vote by the committee will become the chief executive-designate of the Special Administrative Region of China, as Hong Kong will be called from next July 1.\nOn the eve of the vote a small band of pro-democracy protesters camped overnight outside the conference centre.\nSome politicians and diplomats fretted about China-style repression. \"The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him (Tung) to protect our rights...I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,\" said legislator Martin Lee.\n\"Unless there is a complete change in the attitude of these candidates the outlook for human rights in Hong Kong is very bad,\" said Paul Harris, head of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.\nBut the markets, a barometer of Hong Kong's fortunes, trumpeted bullish optimism. Hong Kong stocks rebounded from recent losses to end 198 points up, the index of China-linked H-shares soared to nine-month highs in the largest one-day gain in history, and forecasters predicted a 1997 property boom.\nPublicly espousing \"consensus\" rather than confrontation with China, and collective duties over individual rights, and blessed by a public handshake from President Jiang Zemin in January, 59-year-old Shanghai-born Tung grabbed 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee.\nHe only needs 201 to win the clincher on Wednesday. Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for Wednesday.\nIf he wins, he will be greeted by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics, in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco).\nGovernor Chris Patten has vowed support for the future leader, whoever he is, in the twilight of British rule.\nBut Tung has not responded to the plege. He has said he will consult Hong Kong's respected civil service on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.\n\"Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,\" Tung said on Monday.\nIf he wins, Tung will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy. His team is expected to be highly pro-business.\nHe will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.", "Executives from British Telecom Plc and MCI Communications Corp were on Saturday attempting to stitch together a $22 billion merger that would turn BT into the world's second largest telecoms group.\nMCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry on Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.\nBT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.\nAnalysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.\nThe deal would be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications market and the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.\nA BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.\nHe would not be drawn on where the meeting was taking place, saying only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.\nThe spokesman said an announcement was anticipated prior to the opening of the London stock market on Monday. Sources close to the talks said no announcement was likely on Saturday.\nBT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated.\nBT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable & Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.\nAny BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.\nAnalysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&T.\nIts critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.\n\"This is AT&T Corp's worst nightmare,\" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nAT&T said late on Friday that it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.\n\"We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,\" it said.\nHowever, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.\nFor its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said on Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.\nOne potential problem is a media joint venture between MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. BT would end up with MCI's 13 percent non-voting stake in News Corp and this could cause regulatory difficulties in Britain.\nBritish telecoms watchdog Oftel recently banned a joint advertising campaign between BT and satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a company in which News Corp is the main shareholder.", "Delayed export financing is slowing Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals but shipments for existing contracts will continue ahead of an imminent government decision on licences and marketing rates, exporters and shipping sources said on Friday.\n\"The central bank has stopped backing private lenders,\" said one exporter. \"Buying activity has slowed down in the past two days.\"\nNo immediate figures on  latest arrivals were available on Friday.\nAt least one major bank has stopped financing, and exporters expect others to follow suit unless rates are published soon.\n\"Exporters with licences from 1995/96 and enough money are carrying on buying and shipping. November contracts are fewer than December but still have to be met,\" said one exporter.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24 but delayed an announcemement on guideline buyer and exporter marketing rates. \"They have never been so late,\" said an exporter.\nAlmost no cocoa trucking activity was visible at Abidjan on Friday. But large consignments of cocoa can be seen in warehouses and total port stocks are now estimated by shippers to be over 100,000 tonnes.\nOne banker financing some large exporters said many of their clients had no cocoa in port and the owner of the stocks was not clear. A large shipment to Amsterdam from Ivory Coast is expected within two weeks.\n\"Port stocks will probably slip before cocoa arrivals pick up after licensing,\" said one exporter. \"Activity will probably pick up after November 15 when licence finances have been sorted out.\"\nExporters are expecting total arrivals for November of between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes, rising to a December peak before a slow January tail-off. Exporters' total year crop estimates pivot around 900,000 tonnes.\nShipping companies expected licences to be out by Friday but are now waiting for an announcement next week.  \"Many companies we deal with were saying licences would be out by the weekend but we have heard nothing about rates,\" said one source.\nLicences are usually announced by the Ministry of Agriculture but no date has been set.\nCaistab sources said this week a list of approved cocoa exporters had been drawn up by Wednesday but still had to be signed by the Minister of Commerce. The list had been expected by exporters on Wednesday.\nCaistab president Yves-Marie Koissy is still in the U.S, but could return next week, said Caistab sources.\nExporters have rejected Caistab requests to them to argue for a cut in freight rates. They have also rejected a government plan to make exporters responsible for collecting buyers' unpaid income taxes.\n\"The Caistab is also trying to get exporters to pull down freight rates but they (exporters) are refusing to approach shipping lines,\" said another port source.\n\"Exporters want the rates set the same, so their rebate from the Caistab is not cut,\" the source added.\nPod counters recently up country said large quantities of cocoa were seen along roadsides and moving through warehouses.\n\"November arrivals will be strong as soon as the uncertainty is over,\" said one.", "Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik on Monday, for the second week in a row, skipped a meeting with the Prague bourse's governing chamber, amid growing calls for his ministry to tackle problems in Czech securities trading.\n\"At two o'clock (Kocarnik) cancelled his participation in this afternoon's meeting,\" Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) spokesman Milan Vodicka told Reuters.\nThe bourse's Chamber, which has been seeking stronger ministry action to ease investors' concerns about market transparency, later declined Kocarnik's return invitation for a \"future\" meeting at his ministry.\nThe meetings had been scheduled to discuss taking tougher regulatory action to address concerns of transparency and insider trading on Czech capital markets.\nJiri Spicka, director of the Finance Ministry's banking division, told Reuters that Kocarnik was \"too busy with the preparation of the state budget\" and \"it was impossible for him to leave the ministry\".\nThe budget has been expected for weeks to go to the floor of parliament for its second reading in the session which begins on Tuesday.\nKocarnik then invited the 18-member Chamber to his ministry for a \"future\" meeting, Spicka said.\nThe Chamber later declined that invitation, an official at the office of Chamber Chairman Tomas Jezek told Reuters.\nJezek lambasted Kocarnik on Sunday for lax regulation of the capital markets during the annual national congress of the ruling Civic Democratic Party, of which both men are members.\nJezek told the party meeting that the reluctance of finance ministry officials to more strongly regulate the capital markets was \"absurd\" and investors' lack of confidence could eventually do major damage the country's balance of payments.\n\"The capital account of our payments balance is alreday unable to level with a growing deficit in our trade balance, and the capital market needs to gain back the lost confidence,\" Jezek was quoted by the daily Pravo as saying.\nJezek warned that poor capital market regulation might even force a devaluation of the crown if confidence is not restored.\nJezek is leading plans to set up an independent markets watchdog akin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), funded by transaction fees, by the middle of next year.\nThe finance ministry has balked at the plan, but Jezek is widely believed to have the backing of the parliament's budget committee which he has said will probably submit legislation permitting a Czech SEC to be set up in the first half of 1997.\nKocarnik has rejected criticism that his ministry is failing in its responsibility to properly regulate the system, and says stronger regulations would be \"anti-market\".\nStill, foreign and domestic investors have repeatedly called for steps to beef up the supervision of the Czech capital market, and the ministry has said it is considering its own plan to re-regulate securities trading.\nRichard Salzmann, chairman of the largest Czech bank Komercni Banka a.s., told Pravo that \"none of the more important groups want to trade on this capital market.\"", "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus accused opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman of lying and losing his nerve as neck-and-neck campaigning for weekend Senate elections turned increasingly bitter.\nZeman made a thinly-veiled allegation that the BIS intelligence agency had tried to extract compromising material from his elderly mother.\nThe slanging match between the two leading antagonists of Czech politics began on Monday when BIS director Stanislav Devaty, a Klaus protege, was forced to quit over allegations of spying on a deputy prime minister and a subsequent coverup.\n\"Yesterday's comments by Zeman on a police state, or on the BIS as a political police in the service of one party, are a visible result of losing his nerve before the elections,\" Klaus told a news conference.\n\"I can imagine such words being said by a radical anarchist but I can't imagine them from one of the three highest constitutional officials of this country.\"\nOn Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.\n\"The political struggle should be a struggle of arguments and not an abuse of secret services for spying on political opponents,\" he said.\n\"During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians,\" said Zeman.\nSpymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the junior Christian Democrats in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago.\nThe BIS had covered up the operation by failing to report it to the cabinet and a parliamentary commission supervising the agency.\nKlaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, who is also agriculture minister, but on a former adviser of his who was director of a bank which collapsed amidst fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the state security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.\nDevaty was a member of Klaus's ODS, although he had suspended his membership to become BIS chief.\nAllegations of politically-inspired spying on both government and opposition politicians have surfaced regularly in recent years in a country where memories remain of the pervasive state security apparatus before communism fell in 1989.\nThe political temperature soared on Tuesday when Zeman said his 79-year-old mother had been visited by \"certain people\" trying to acquire compromising information.\nAsked about this comment, Klaus said: \"If this actually represents what he said then this is such an unbelievable lie that I couldn't bring myself to reply at all. It's pure lie.\"\nKlaus accused Zeman of running a negative campaign.\n\"Instead of programmes there are scandals and affairs which destabilise the state and damage our country abroad,\" he said.\n\"The BIS affair is a clear evidence that above all the (Social Democrats) lack, in contrast to the ODS, a positive programme.\"", "China's economy grew by 9.6 percent in the first nine months of 1996, but many urban family incomes are lagging behind, the State Statistical Bureau said Wednesday.\nChinese industrial output was up, farmers were on their way to a year of record grain harvests and the scourge of inflation had been tamed to a year-on-year 6.6 percent in the first three quarters, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.\n\"The development of the macro-economy overall appears good,\" Ye told a news conference.\nGross domestic product was 4.5675 trillion yuan ($550.3 billion) between January and September, up 9.6 percent from the same period of 1995, Ye said, but gave no details. China's GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995.\nThe average urban income rose to 3,249 yuan ($391) between January and September, an actual year-on-year increase of 3.4 percent, he said.\nBut the incomes of many urban residents are lagging behind as China's economy booms, Ye said.\nA survey of 35 major cities and towns had revealed that the incomes per family member of around 40 percent of households had declined, he said.\nSome of the decline was the ordinary result of the birth of children or the retirement of older family members, he said.\n\"The second kind of situation is when the level of income falls or the level of income growth cannot keep up with inflation,\" Ye said, adding such problems were the cause of the income fall in about half the families surveyed.\n\"The difficulties of some low-income urban families have been aggravated,\" he said.\nHe gave no explanation of the decline in incomes suffered by some urban wage-earners, but many surplus workers in China's huge and largely stagnant state sector have been sent home on minimum salaries.\nAlthough such workers are not considered unemployed and the state sector is highly reluctant to fire employees, China's urban unemployment rate hit 2.98 percent at the end of September, Ye said.\nThe number of unemployed in Chinese cities reached 5.3 million, he said, but gave no comparative figures.\nChina's urban jobless rate was 2.9 percent by the end of June, the same as the official figure for 1995, but state newspapers have warned that unemployment, a major concern for Beijing's communist leadership, could shoot up to 7.4 percent by 2000.\nOptimism over the economy and the success of a continuing policy of tight credit aimed at curbing inflation and reining in runaway growth has been boosted by predictions that 1996 will be a bumper year for China's hundreds of millions of farmers.\nGovernment policies had encouraged farmers to increase the area of land under grain, and grain output this year was forecast to exceed 480 million metric tons, beating the 1995 record harvest by about 15 million tons, Ye said.\nChina had set a target of 465 million tons for 1996.\nOther figures released by the Statistical Bureau also painted a positive picture of an economy that Beijing says is on target for a \"soft landing\" after years of breakneck growth.\nYear-on-year retail price inflation in the first three quarters was curbed to 6.6 percent, down 10 percentage points compared with the same period of 1995, Ye said.\nThe Xinhua news agency on Wednesday quoted economic tsar Zhu Rongji as forecasting inflation would be below 6.5 percent in 1996 and as saying it would be possible to cut it to six percent next year.\nRetail inflation hit 21.8 percent in 1994.", "Germany's David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman's bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm's quest for his second final appearance in two weeks.\nPrinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate.\nSeventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set.\nBut in the 10th game of the match, Henman's serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point.\nHenman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set.\nThe British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to.\nPrinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control.\nHenman said: \"I didn't serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn't really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office.\n\"I'm disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I've played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris.\"\nPrinosil said: \"I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me.\"\nDamm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week's march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played.\nVictimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich.\nFor Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches.\nThe former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings.\n\"I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I've never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level,\" said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.", "The British government on Wednesday published new draft legislation governing home lending institutions but a lack of parliamentary time might mean it will not reach the statute book before a general election.\nThe Building Societies Bill, if passed, would remove a society's five-year immunity from takeover once it converts to bank status if it, in turn, took over another financial institution.\nImmunity would not be affected by one of the new banks buying mortgage books or by joint ventures, however.\nThe draft received a mixed reception from the four societies currently planning to convert themselves into banks.\nA Treasury spokeswoman admitted that there was currently no slot for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda but added it remained hopeful an opportunity could arise in the New Year.\n\"The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,\" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. \"When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($49.97 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government has not taken into account its \"serious concerns\" on the timing of the draft.\n\"Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,\" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.\nIf the bill was enacted, she said the Woolwich board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.\nIn contrast the Northern Rock, also planning a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.\n\"We are delighted with it,\" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. \"It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you cant ask for more than that.\"\nThe Building Societies Association also welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.\nThe Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary.", "Australia's second largest telephone carrier Optus Communications rang up its first annual profit on Wednesday and is on track for its sharemarket float by the end of the year.\nOptus, established at the start of 1992 to compete with Australia's main telephone carrier, state-owned Telstra Corp, reported a pre-tax profit of A$60.3 million (US$47.64 million) in the year to June 30, 1996.\nThis compares with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.\n\"After a tremendous effort during its first few years, Optus is now in a very strong position to capitalise on the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing telecommunications industry,\" chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski said in a statement.\nThe profit was within expectations. Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$65 million.\n\"I don't think the market will be disappointed,\" said one Sydney-based analyst. \"I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about.\"\nThe results reflected strong revenue growth of 36 percent to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96, with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long-distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday.\nOptus, 24.5 percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A$2.0 billion in revenue in 1995/96.\nThe Sydney-based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of 1996, Switkowski said.\n\"The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done,\" he told reporters after the results anouncement.\nThe float is expected to raise around A$1.5 billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to 40 percent of the company shares to be listed.\nOptus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange.\nThe Australian government plans to raise A$8.0 billion from the sale of one-third of Telstra in 1997/98, which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July 11, 1997.\nDespite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its 46.5 percent-owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision.\nOptus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million, which were mainly due to the start-up of the offshoot, which is spending A$3.0 billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services.\nOptus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A$1.54 million in 1994/95, in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its 1995/96 results.\nSwitkowski was coy about 1996/97 forecasts.

This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nWhile the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.\nVasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.\n\"The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,\" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.\nShortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.\nEarlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.\nThe Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.\nLow turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.\nOnly 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.\nThe Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.\nAfterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.\nZeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.\n\"When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,\" he said.\nOne Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.\nWagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.\nWagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.", "The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index reached its 50th record close of 1996 on Thursday and broke the 5600 barrier for the first time.\nThe TSE 300 Composite Index rose 8.01 points to close at 5598.82, surpassing a streak of 45 record finishes in 1987.\nThe Index also breached the 5600 barrier, setting an intraday high of 5601.88.\n\"It's just another record in a string of more to come.

To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost \"roughly 10 million stg\", he added.\nPoole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. \"There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,\" he said.  \nWhile Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.\nThornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.\nRather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or \"possibly more\". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.", "President Boris Yeltsin's surgery on Tuesday might be a heart stopper for some volatile commodities and currency markets, but recent history proves Russian oil and gas exports are unfazed by Kremlin dramas.\nTraders have seen tanks fire at Russia's White House, cloak-and-dagger power struggles and war in oil-rich Chechnya -- and each time, they say, Russian supplies of oil and natural gas to Europe and the Mediterranean have held steady.\nRussia is the world's third-largest crude oil producer and single biggest natural gas producer; its energy heats and powers much of Europe and is a multi-billion dollar cash cow for Russia no matter who sits in the Kremlin hot seat.\nThis time, with Yeltsin under the knife this morning for a gruelling, hours-long heart bypass, should be no different.\n\"Politics don't affect us,\" said trader Vladimir Solovyov of Nafta-Moskva, one of Russia's leading oil exporters.\n\"We are more interested in things like government decrees saying'export tariff introduced' or'export tariff scrapped'.\nYeltsin's surgery began against domestic and international worries that if the operation fails, Russia could plunge into political uncertainty that could hit oil and gas exports.\nWith about one third of Russia's 6.2 million barrels per day output exported outside the former Soviet Union, and with Russian natural gas keeping one third of Europe warm, it is easy to see why traders worry about supply.\nBut when Russian oil exports do fluctuate, it is on less dramatic events, like storms at the Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk, one-off government supply programmes to former Soviet allies and which oil company is flavour of the month with export officials.\nGas exports can fluctuate on occasional explosions in Russia's gas pipeline system, the largest in the world.\nAnalysts said that with domestic demand flat while the Russian economy recovers, exports will be stable near-term.\nIndustry sources said there is no danger of conservative officials playing with the taps while Yeltsin was incapacitated, but they said some risk-averse European buyers could insist on contract terms less beneficial to Russian exporters.\n\"Our partners could get worried and demand terms not as attractive to us,\" said a trade financer at International Economic Cooperation, or MES, another leading oil exporter.\nOthers said money, not politics, motivated exports -- and with domestic oil prices below world levels, it is not hard to make money exporting the stuff.\n\"We like good prices on world markets,\" Nafta-Moskva's Solovyov said.\nPolitical tensions in other major oil exporting countries often cause benchmark London and New York oil prices to leap over worries about supply disruptions.\nNervous International Petroleum Exchange traders swung spot prices in London when Yeltsin sacked maverick security tsar General Alexander Lebed last month.\nBut Moscow oil traders and analysts said that everyone should just calm down.\n\"This stuff (oil) is scheduled for export months in advance and it's technically very difficult to fiddle with the taps,\" said energy analyst Peter Houlder of CentreInvest consultancy.", "Fund manager Nicola Horlick's row with her ex-employer Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) continued to be played out in public on Wednesday as she admitted that she had been in talks with a rival banking group until several days before she was suspended.\nBut Horlick stressed that the talks with Dutch firm ABN AMRO were of an \"informal and preliminary nature\" and at no time had she provided confidential information about the business or colleagues.\n\"The talks terminated several days before I was suspended,\" said Horlick. \"My aim was always to keep the clients and the team together for the benefit of all.\"\nThe benefit of all included MGAM whom, she said, she had never intended to leave.\nHorlick, one of London's most prominent fund managers, resigned last week after being suspended amid allegations she planned to defect to ABN AMRO and was soliciting MGAM colleagues to go with her.\nThe suspension came just days after she had been promoted to be managing director of MGAM and since then her fight to be reinstated or compensated for the loss of her job has rarely been out of the headlines.\nOnce again the lure of the cameras proved difficult to resist on Wednesday and in a television interview, Horlick repeated her determination to clear her name.\n\"When you're faced with the fact that people are saying that you've done something wrong and you know you haven't you have to fight for yourself.

Instead, he has proposed selling the stake to multiple investors.\nCurrently, the state owns a 60% stake in Komercni Banka, and the proposed sale would reduce that to a minority stake. Rusnok believes that selling the stake to multiple investors would be the most beneficial option for the bank, its customers, and the Czech economy as a whole.\nIn his statement, Rusnok stated that \"a gradual reduction of the state's stake should aim to sell the shares to multiple investors, whether they are foreign or domestic.\" He went on to explain that selling to multiple investors would increase the bank's capital base and provide it with the necessary resources to pursue its growth ambitions.\nRusnok acknowledged that there have been concerns that reducing the state's stake could lead to Komercni Banka being bought out by a foreign entity. However, he dismissed those concerns, saying that \"the bank is well-managed and has a strong market position, making it attractive to a range of investors.\"\nMany financial experts have praised Rusnok's proposal, saying that it would help to diversify the bank's shareholder base and make it more resilient to changes in the economy. They have also pointed out that a wider range of investors would increase competition and make the bank more efficient.\nThe announcement comes after a turbulent few years for Komercni Banka, which has struggled to keep pace with the rapid changes in the financial sector. Last year, the bank posted a net profit of 6.2 billion crowns ($272.19 million), down from 8.3 billion the previous year. The decline in profits was mainly attributed to a sharp rise in provisions for bad loans.\nRusnok believes that selling the stake to multiple investors would help the bank to weather the storm and emerge stronger in the long run. \"A more diversified shareholder base will provide the bank with more stability and reduce the risk of any one shareholder having too much influence,\" he said.\nThe proposal has been well-received by industry experts, with many predicting that it will lead to a positive outcome for the bank and its customers. However, there is still some uncertainty about the timing and specifics of the sale. Rusnok has said that the sale will be carried out in a gradual manner, but no further details have been provided at this stage.\nNonetheless, the decision to sell the state's stake to multiple investors will undoubtedly be a positive step for Komercni Banka and the Czech economy as a whole. The move will not only provide the bank with the capital it needs to grow, but it will also help to diversify the financial sector and increase competition. As such, it is sure to be welcomed by investors and consumers alike.", "Toronto, Canada - In response to the announcement of the new budget cuts, a group of protesters paralyzed the subway and businesses in Toronto. The protest occurred on the morning of February 17, 2021, causing discomfort and delay for many commuters and business owners.\nThe group of protesters, primarily composed of transit workers and union activists, organized the demonstration to show their opposition to the budget cuts proposed by the city council, which primarily targeted transportation, infrastructure, and healthcare.\nAs a part of this demonstration, the protesters entered the subway station, chanting slogans, and carrying banners that read messages such as \"Invest in our public services, not cuts,\" \"Save our transit system,\" and \"Cuts hurt our families.\"\nThe protesters also locked themselves to the turnstiles, preventing commuters from entering the subway station. Consequently, the police had to intervene, detaining some of the protesters to clear the way for commuters.\nWhile the protesters targeted the subway station, others targeted key financial districts in Toronto, including Bay Street and King Street. They formed human chains to prevent workers from entering the buildings, causing businesses to close for the day.\nSeveral small business owners, economic analysts, and civil rights activists have criticized the protests, saying that it was unfair to disrupt businesses that had nothing to do with the budget cuts. Still, the leader of the protest, Tim Maguire, president of CUPE Ontario, maintained that the protest was necessary to drive home the message that cuts to public services affected the community's health, safety, and future.\n\"This demonstration shows our collective power. We will not tolerate austerity measures that compromise the basic necessities of our lives. Our jobs, wages, and healthcare are not up for negotiation,\" said Tim Maguire.\nThe budget cut proposal was initially tabled by Mayor Harper, saying that the city needs to reduce spending and eliminate the budget deficit in four years. In a statement released after the protest, Mayor Harper said the demonstration was unwarranted and disrespectful to the city's citizens and businesses.\n\"We understand that the budget cut may cause some discomfort initially, but we also recognise that it is a necessary step to ensure that our city's finances remain healthy and viable in the long run,\" criticized the mayor.\nMeanwhile, commuters who were stuck in the subway station expressed frustration and disappointment with the demonstration, saying that it was unfair to hold them hostage and cause them to be late for work and other appointments.\nAs the protest grew more intense, the police had to intervene and clear the subway station and business districts. The protest dispersed peacefully, with the protesters promising to continue with the demonstration until the budget cuts are reversed.\nIn conclusion, the protest that paralyzed the Toronto subway and businesses reflected the growing anger and frustration of the citizens with the proposed budget cuts. While the protesters argue that the cuts would hurt the community, including the transportation and healthcare systems, the city council insists that these measures are necessary to balance the books and reduce the budget deficit. As it stands, the two sides are at odds, with no immediate solution in sight.", "As Europe approaches the midway point of the summer season, Central and Eastern European (CEE) stock markets are basking in the glow of spectacular growth, driven in part by a global economic rebound, which has fueled investor optimism. But as the region's economies continue to face headwinds, CEE investors are assessing the sustainability of the market's growth in the coming months.\nThe CEE region has been a standout performer so far this year, with the Vienna Stock Exchange leading the charge, gaining 24.3% year-to-date (YTD), followed by the Prague Stock Exchange, up 19.2% YTD, and the Warsaw Stock Exchange, up 11.5% YTD. This compares to the Euro Stoxx 50, which is up 17.5% YTD, and the S&P 500, up 18% YTD.\nThe region's strong performance can be traced back to the rebound in global oil prices, which has had a positive impact on CEE energy stocks. Additionally, the European Union's economic recovery fund has injected new life into the region's economies, providing a much-needed boost to domestic demand.\nAnother factor behind the region's growth is the successful vaccine rollout, which has allowed countries to begin relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, leading to an increase in business activity. And, as global inflation concerns drive investors away from bonds and towards equities, the CEE region has emerged as a promising investment opportunity.\nDespite strong economic growth, investors remain cautious about the region's long-term prospects. While many CEE countries have made significant strides over the past decade, economic growth and investment have not been evenly distributed throughout the region.\nHungary, for example, has seen tremendous growth, driven in part by infrastructure investments from the government. At the same time, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria have not seen the same level of growth due to a lack of infrastructure investment. While EU recovery funds will undoubtedly help narrow the gap, it will take years to close the divide completely.\n\"The economic growth in the region is solid, but we need to remain mindful of the fact that some countries have simply taken longer than others,\" said Jian Xie, Senior Vice President at Moody's Investors Service. \"While some countries have made great strides over the past decade, others still have some work to do.\"\nMoreover, while the region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains highly sensitive to changes in global economic conditions. With the Delta variant of COVID-19 still spreading, there are concerns that the recovery could be hampered by future waves of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, the region's economies remain highly dependent on exports. While the recovery in global demand has been a boon for CEE exporters, it also leaves the economies vulnerable to a further slowdown in global trade.\n\"Investors need to be mindful of the fact that the CEE region remains highly dependent on exports,\" said Xie. \"This means that any slowdown in global trade will have a significant impact on the region's economic growth.\"\nDespite these concerns, analysts remain bullish on the region's long-term prospects. Given the region's favorable demographic profile, low labor costs, and improving infrastructure, it remains poised for strong growth in the coming years.\n\"The CEE region has all of the ingredients for long-term economic growth,\" said Xie. \"The challenge is ensuring that the growth is sustainable and evenly distributed throughout the region.\"\nWith the summer season in full swing, investors are taking a cautious approach to the region's bourses, keeping a close eye on global economic conditions and the ongoing fight against COVID-19. While the CEE region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains to be seen whether the summer sun will remain shining on the bourses over the long term.", "Nalco Chemical Co, one of the leading specialty chemical companies in the world, announced today that it expects double-digit earnings growth for the upcoming financial year.

Lo emphasized that the new legislature will be set up to support Hong Kong's development and ensure that the city remains safe, prosperous, and stable.\nThe China-appointed legislature, which is expected to be set up in the near future, is intended to replace the current Legislative Council in Hong Kong. The Legislative Council, which is made up entirely of elected members, has been the subject of controversy in recent years, with many accusing the council of being too liberal and failing to represent the views of the majority of Hong Kong citizens.\nLo, who is a prominent figure in the pro-Beijing camp, stated that the new legislature will operate in accordance with the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of Hong Kong. He emphasized that the new body will be committed to upholding the principles of \"One Country, Two Systems\" and \"Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.\"\nLo also sought to dispel concerns that the new legislature would undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions. He stated that the new body would work in close cooperation with the existing government and other institutions in Hong Kong, and that it would seek to work with all parties to achieve the common good.\nThe pro-Beijing party leader also outlined the priorities of the new legislature. He emphasized that it would focus on economic growth, job creation, and social stability. He stated that the new body would seek to create a favorable business environment for investors and support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in the city.\nLo also addressed concerns over the proposed legislation to prevent acts of terrorism and subversion in Hong Kong. He emphasized that the new legislation would be aimed at targeting only those individuals and organizations that pose a threat to the security and stability of Hong Kong. He stated that the new legislation would not be used to suppress dissent or infringe on the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens.\nThe proposed China-appointed legislature has been the subject of much controversy in Hong Kong since it was first announced. Many opposition politicians and activists have criticized the plan, arguing that it represents a blatant attempt by Beijing to undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions.\nOpposition leaders have called for a boycott of the new legislature, and have staged numerous protests and demonstrations in recent months. Many have accused Beijing of trying to erode the freedoms and autonomy that have made Hong Kong one of the world's most vibrant and dynamic cities.\nDespite the opposition, pro-Beijing leaders have remained steadfast in their support for the new legislature. They argue that it is necessary to strengthen the stability and security of Hong Kong, and to ensure that the city remains a prosperous and vibrant hub of economic activity in the region.\nThe proposed legislation has also sparked concern internationally, with many Western democracies expressing their concern about the impact of the new legislation on human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. The United States and other Western countries have warned China that any attempt to erode the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions would be met with strong international condemnation and action.\nDespite these concerns, however, Beijing has shown little sign of backing down from its plans for the new legislation. Many analysts predict that the new legislature will be set up in the coming months, and that it will represent a major shift in the political landscape of Hong Kong.\nAs the debate over the new legislation continues to rage, it is clear that Hong Kong is facing a pivotal moment in its history. The city's future is at stake, and the decisions made in the coming months and years will have a lasting impact on the people of Hong Kong and the wider region.", "Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has warned that its profit outlook could be subdued in the coming year. The bank cites a competitive housing market and rising operating costs as the main reasons for its caution.\nThe housing market in Australia has been a key driver of the country's economy over the past few years. However, the market has cooled somewhat in recent months. There has been a reduction in the number of people looking to buy property, driven in part by stricter lending standards imposed on banks by regulators. This has led to increased competition among banks for a smaller pool of borrowers.\nCBA is the largest mortgage lender in Australia, with a market share of around 20%. Despite this, the bank has been forced to compete with other lenders on price, offering discounts and other incentives to win business. This has put pressure on the bank's margins, as it seeks to maintain profitability.\nThe cooling housing market has also had an impact on CBA's revenue streams. The bank's wealth management division, which includes its funds management and financial advice businesses, has seen a reduction in net inflows. This is due to lower demand from customers for investment products, as they stay cautious in the current economic environment.\nMeanwhile, CBA's operating costs have continued to rise. The bank has been investing heavily in technology, as it seeks to improve its digital services and remain competitive in the fast-changing financial services landscape. It has also been spending money on compliance and risk management, following a number of high-profile scandals in the industry.\nAll of these factors have led CBA to warn that its profit outlook could be subdued in the coming year. The bank said it expects its earnings to be impacted by \"ongoing margin pressure in the retail banking business, subdued growth in lending volumes, and higher operating expenses\".\nCBA's caution comes as the broader Australian banking sector faces a number of headwinds. In addition to the cooling housing market, banks are also facing the ongoing fallout from the Royal Commission into misconduct in the industry. The Commission, which concluded earlier this year, exposed a series of unethical practices in the sector, and has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and tougher penalties.\nAs a result, the banks are having to invest heavily in compliance and risk management, while also facing the prospect of fines and compensation payments for past misdeeds. This has put further pressure on their bottom lines.\nHowever, there are some bright spots for CBA and the wider banking sector. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates to a record low of 1%, in a bid to stimulate the economy. This should help to boost demand for loans, which could benefit the banks.\nIn addition, the government has announced plans to ease the burden of responsible lending rules on banks, which could make it easier for them to lend to customers. The move has been welcomed by the banking sector, which has criticised the current rules for being overly burdensome.\nDespite these positive developments, however, CBA remains cautious about the future. The bank said it will continue to focus on improving efficiency and productivity, in order to maintain profitability in a challenging environment.\nIn a statement, CBA CEO Matt Comyn said: \"We are operating in a challenging environment, but we remain focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to invest in our business and make the necessary changes to adapt to the changing marketplace.\" \nOverall, CBA's warning of a subdued profit outlook is a reminder of the challenges facing the Australian banking sector. Despite record low interest rates and measures to stimulate the economy, banks are still grappling with an uncertain economic outlook, increased regulatory scrutiny, and intense competition. It remains to be seen how long these headwinds will last, and how successful banks will be in navigating them.", "Paris, France - Lagardere, the French multinational media conglomerate, has announced a deal that will ensure its electronics subsidiary, Lagardere Electronics, remains under French ownership. The agreement, made with French investment firm Acrotec, means that the company's jobs and digital TV know-how will remain rooted in French hands, much to the relief of employees and industry stakeholders.\nLagardere Electronics, which specializes in the development and production of digital TV decoders and other electronics devices, has been owned by the Lagardere group since 2006. However, in recent years the company has faced increasing financial pressure, prompting rumors that it would be sold-off.\n\"We were deeply concerned about the future of our jobs and the state of the industry if Lagardere Electronics were to fall into foreign hands,\" said Francois Dupont, a representative of the company's employee union. \"But with this deal, we can all breathe a sigh of relief. This is a win for us - and a win for France.\"\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Acrotec will acquire a majority stake in Lagardere Electronics, while the Lagardere group will retain a 25% stake and a seat on the company's board of directors. This allows Lagardere to maintain a measure of control over the company's direction, while freeing it from the financial burden of operating a struggling subsidiary.\n\"This deal is a positive outcome for all parties involved,\" said Arnaud Lagardere, CEO of the Lagardere group. \"We are able to refocus our resources on our core businesses, while ensuring the continued growth of Lagardere Electronics under French ownership.\"\nMany in the industry see the deal as a boost to France's position in the highly competitive electronics market. Lagardere Electronics has a strong reputation for expertise in digital TV technologies, and the agreement means that this knowledge will remain within France.\n\"This is a significant development for the French electronics industry,\" said Marie-Claire Balmes, a spokesperson for the French Electronics Federation. \"Lagardere Electronics is a major player in the sector, and keeping this expertise within French hands is essential for the long-term growth of the industry.\"\nThe deal is also seen as a positive sign for the French economy as a whole, which has been struggling in recent years to maintain competitiveness against other European countries.\n\"We are pleased to see the continued commitment of investors to the French market,\" said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. \"This deal is yet another example of the strength of French industry, and we hope to see more investments of this kind in the future.\"\nAs news of the deal spread, many employees at Lagardere Electronics expressed their gratitude for the security it will provide. Antoine Blanc, an engineer at the company, said, \"I've been with Lagardere for 10 years, and I was worried about what the future held for my colleagues and me. But this deal is excellent news. We can now look forward to continuing our work with the knowledge that our jobs are secure.\"\nThe agreement is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, pending approval from French regulators. Once completed, Lagardere Electronics will be well-positioned to continue its growth as a major player in the French electronics industry \u2013 a welcome relief in difficult times.", "MCI Communications Corp., a leading telecommunications provider, has entered into a 10-year agreement with NextWave Telecom Inc. which will enable it to compete with the top tier of U.S. wireless providers. The deal will see MCI leasing NextWave's extensive wireless spectrum holdings, enabling it to offer high-speed wireless services to its customers. The move is viewed as a significant step for MCI as it attempts to broaden its reach in the telecommunications industry.\n\"This deal is a game-changer for MCI,\" said the company's CEO, Fred Briggs. \"We are now in the same league as the big players in the wireless industry, and we're excited to be able to offer our customers a broader range of services.\"\nNextWave has been an important player in the wireless spectrum market, having acquired significant holdings during auctions held by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in recent years. The company's spectrum holdings include frequencies that are well-suited for wireless data services, making it an attractive partner for MCI.\nUnder the terms of the deal, NextWave will lease its spectrum to MCI for 10 years, with MCI assuming responsibility for all related costs, including deployment and maintenance of wireless infrastructure. The arrangement will enable MCI to extend its network infrastructure to provide high-speed wireless services to customers in markets where it currently does not have a presence in the wireless market.\nMCI's entry into the wireless market is well-timed given the increasing demand for wireless data services. The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices has led to a surge in data usage, with customers demanding faster speeds and higher quality services. With the NextWave deal, MCI is positioning itself to meet the demand for high-speed wireless services while expanding its core business offerings.\nThe addition of wireless services also presents MCI with the opportunity to bundle multiple services into a single package for its customers, a strategy that has proven successful for other major telecom providers in the U.S. The company's core business already includes voice and data services, and the addition of wireless services will enable it to offer a complete portfolio of telecommunications services to customers.\nThe announcement of the NextWave deal has been well-received by industry analysts, who view it as a smart move for MCI. \"This is a bold move for MCI, and it's one that's likely to pay off in the long run,\" said Roger Entner, an industry analyst with Recon Analytics. \"By adding wireless services to its portfolio, MCI is positioning itself for growth and diversifying its revenue streams at the same time.\"\nThe deal with NextWave also comes at a time when the U.S. wireless market is undergoing significant consolidation. Major players in the industry, such as T-Mobile and Sprint, have recently announced plans to merge, reducing competition in the market. The addition of MCI to the mix will help to maintain some level of competition while offering customers a new option for their wireless needs.\nThe agreement with NextWave is expected to take effect in the first quarter of next year, pending approval from the FCC. In the meantime, MCI will begin making plans for the deployment of wireless infrastructure to support its new wireless services. The company plans to offer a range of wireless data services, including high-speed internet, video streaming, and mobile connectivity.\nWith the NextWave deal, MCI is poised to enter a new phase of growth and expansion in the telecommunications industry. By adding wireless services to its portfolio, the company is taking a strategic step forward that will enable it to compete with the biggest names in the wireless market. The deal is a sign of MCI's confidence in its ability to succeed in a highly competitive industry, and a clear signal that it intends to play a major role in the future of telecommunications in the U.S.", "Cupertino, California - Apple has finally announced its newest addition to the PowerBook family with the much-awaited built-in CD-ROM drive and a bigger screen.

While the deposit has brought much-needed economic growth to the region, it has also caused significant environmental concerns and strained relationships between the Indigenous community and mining companies.\nThe Voisey's Bay deposit was discovered in 1993, and after much exploration, became one of the largest nickel and copper mines in the world. The deposit is located in the traditional territory of the Innu Nation, whose members have lived in the region for thousands of years.\nInitially, the discovery of the deposit brought hope and promise to the Innu Nation. The mining company, Vale, promised jobs, training opportunities, and economic growth for the community. However, as the mine began operations, tensions began to rise.\nThe Innu Nation has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the mine on the land, water, and wildlife in the region. They have also expressed concerns about the lack of consultation and involvement in the mine's operations and decision-making processes.\nIn 2014, the Innu Nation filed a lawsuit against Vale and the government of Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming that they were not properly consulted before the mine was developed, and that their constitutional rights had been violated. The lawsuit also claimed that the mine was causing significant harm to the environment and the traditional way of life of the Innu people.\nThe lawsuit was settled in 2018, with Vale agreeing to provide $2.5 million in funding for Indigenous education and cultural initiatives, and $1 million annually for 10 years to support Innu-led environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.\nDespite the settlement, tensions between the Innu Nation and the mining company continue to persist. In 2019, Vale announced plans to expand the mine, which the Innu Nation, as well as environmental groups, have criticized as posing an even greater risk to the environment and Indigenous land rights.\nHowever, the mine has also brought significant economic benefits to the region. The mine employs nearly 500 people, and supports thousands of indirect jobs in the region. The Innu Nation has also received royalties and other benefits from the mine, which have contributed to the community's economic development and self-sufficiency.\nDespite the economic benefits, many members of the Innu Nation feel that their rights and concerns are being ignored and that the environmental risks of the mine outweigh the benefits. In a statement, Gregory Rich, Chief of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation said, \"We need to find a way to balance economic development with the need to protect our environment and our community. We cannot continue to prioritize profits over people.\"\nThe Voisey's Bay deposit is just one example of the complex issues that arise from resource development in Indigenous territories. Mining and other resource extraction industries can bring much-needed economic growth and job opportunities to Indigenous communities, but they can also cause significant harm to the environment and strain relationships between Indigenous communities and industry.\nMoving forward, it is crucial that mining companies and governments engage in meaningful consultations with Indigenous communities before developing resource extraction projects. This includes listening to concerns and prioritizing the protection of Indigenous land rights and the environment. Only through genuine collaboration and respect can we achieve a balance between economic growth and sustainable development.", "Scottish Amicable, a UK-based life insurance company, has reportedly turned down a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Abbey National, a British multinational banking and financial services firm.\nThe proposed deal would have seen Abbey National acquire Scottish Amicable, which has been operating as a standalone subsidiary of Royal London Group since 2014.\nScottish Amicable was founded in 1826 and is headquartered in Edinburgh. The company offers a range of life insurance, pensions, and investment products to customers in the UK and internationally.\nAccording to sources, Abbey National approached Scottish Amicable with an unsolicited bid in October 2021. The offer valued the insurance company at approximately $2.3 billion, representing a significant premium to its current market value.\nHowever, Scottish Amicable\u2019s board of directors reportedly rejected the offer on the grounds that it did not accurately reflect the company\u2019s true worth.\nIn a statement on the matter, Scottish Amicable CEO Barry O\u2019Dwyer said: \u201cWe have a clear vision for our business and are confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. The offer from Abbey National did not meet our expectations in terms of value, and we therefore declined it.\u201d\nO\u2019Dwyer added that Scottish Amicable\u2019s board had carefully considered the offer and consulted with its financial advisers before making its decision.\nThe news of the rejected bid has caused speculation about the future direction of both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National.\nSome analysts have suggested that Abbey National\u2019s interest in Scottish Amicable may have been driven by a desire to diversify its revenue streams and expand its product offering.\nHowever, others have suggested that the proposed deal may have been primarily motivated by a desire to gain access to Scottish Amicable\u2019s large customer base and distribution channels.\nAbbey National has not yet commented on the matter, although it is understood that the company is considering its options for how best to proceed.\nThe news comes at a challenging time for the insurance industry, which has been grappling with a range of issues including increasing costs, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer behaviour.\nDespite these challenges, Scottish Amicable has remained focused on delivering strong financial results and expanding its customer base.\nIn its most recent financial report, the company reported a 14% increase in new business sales over the previous quarter, driven by strong demand for its life insurance and pension products.\nThe report also noted that Scottish Amicable had taken steps to streamline its operations and reduce costs, which had contributed to a significant improvement in its operating margin.\nThe news of the rejected bid has been met with mixed reactions from Scottish Amicable shareholders.\nSome have expressed disappointment that the company is not willing to consider a takeover offer that would have delivered a substantial return on their investment.\nOthers, however, have praised Scottish Amicable\u2019s decision to reject the offer, arguing that the company is in a strong position and does not need to sell itself to a larger firm in order to continue growing and delivering value to shareholders.\nThe situation is likely to remain unclear for some time, as both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National consider their next move.\nFor now, Scottish Amicable shareholders can take comfort in the fact that their company is committed to delivering long-term value and remains focused on delivering strong financial performance in a challenging business environment.", "The ongoing strike at General Motors (GM) plants in Canada is now affecting the company's operations in the United States. As a result of the strike, GM has decided to halt production at its U.S. factories, leading to the delay of new vehicle models.\nSince September 17, over 17,000 employees at GM's plants in Ontario, Canada, have been on strike. The workers are demanding better job security, higher wages, and improved health benefits. Negotiations between GM and the Canadian labor union, Unifor, have yet to reach a resolution.\nThe strike has disrupted GM's supply chain, especially for parts that are needed to manufacture vehicles. Consequently, the company has decided to temporarily shut down a plant in Tennessee and two facilities in Mexico. GM's factories in Michigan and Indiana will also be impacted by the strike.\nIn addition, GM has informed its workers in the U.S. that the launch of its new vehicles will be postponed due to the supply chain disruptions. This means that customers might have to wait longer than expected for some of GM's highly anticipated models, including the Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV and the new Chevrolet Camaro.\n\"This is a challenging situation for us and our employees in both countries,\" said a spokesperson for GM. \"We are committed to working with our suppliers and union partners to find a resolution as soon as possible.\"\nThe impact of the strike is not limited to GM and its workers. Local economies that rely on income from the plant, such as small businesses and suppliers, will also suffer. For example, the Canadian town of Ingersoll, where one of GM's facilities is located, anticipates a loss of $5 million in revenue for every week the strike continues.\nDespite the negative effects, Unifor President Jerry Dias has said that the union will not back down until their demands are met. \"We are holding out for a fair deal that provides job security and respects the work of our members,\" he said in a statement.\nThe strike at GM is just one example of the ongoing labor disputes in the automotive industry. In recent weeks, several other companies, including Ford, have faced protests and strikes from their employees who are demanding better pay and working conditions.\nFor instance, over 3,000 workers at a Ford factory near Detroit recently voted to go on strike in protest of the company's decision to shift production to Mexico. The workers, who are represented by the United Auto Workers union, are also calling for increased job security and a pay raise.\nLabor disputes in the automotive industry have become more prevalent in recent years as companies seek to cut costs and increase profits. Workers, on the other hand, are looking to protect their jobs and fair wages in an increasingly competitive and uncertain economy.\nThe strike at GM's Canadian plants has now spilled over into the United States, causing a ripple effect across the company's supply chain. It remains to be seen how long the strike will last and what the final outcome will be, but the situation is certainly unsettling for all those involved.\nIn the meantime, customers will have to wait for the launch of GM's new models, while workers and local communities face the economic consequences of the strike. The situation serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of the automotive industry and the importance of fair labor practices for all those involved.", "Prague, Czech Republic - The head of the Czech Republic's largest bank, Zdenek Turek, has announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in the upcoming elections. With a mission to clean up the post-communist banking sector, Turek believes he can make a positive impact from his new position.\nTurek, who currently serves as CEO of Ceska Sporitelna, has been a prominent figure in the country's banking sector for over 20 years. He has also been a vocal advocate for changes in the industry, including the implementation of stricter regulations and the promotion of ethical practices.\nIn his race for a Senate seat, Turek has pledged to prioritize issues related to the banking sector, including transparency, consumer protection, and the prevention of money laundering. He has also expressed his commitment to improving the overall economic climate in the country.\n\"Tackling corruption in the banking sector is crucial for our economy to thrive,\" Turek said in a recent interview. \"I believe that by working from within the Senate, I can make a real difference in ensuring that our financial institutions operate with integrity and accountability.\"\nThe Czech Republic's banking sector has faced significant scrutiny in recent years, with allegations of money laundering and other unethical practices by some of the country's largest financial institutions. In 2019, several high-profile figures were arrested in connection with an alleged \u20ac1 billion fraud scheme involving CZK Bank, one of the country's largest banks.\nTurek has been a vocal critic of such practices and has championed initiatives aimed at curbing unethical behavior in the banking sector. Earlier this year, Ceska Sporitelna launched a new code of ethics aimed at promoting transparency and responsible practices within the institution. The code includes provisions related to anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and environmental responsibility.\nMany in the country's financial sector have expressed support for Turek's candidacy, citing his reputation as a reform-minded leader and his deep understanding of the industry. Others, however, have expressed skepticism that one person can make a meaningful impact from within the Senate.\n\"I think it's great that someone with Turek's experience and expertise is running for office,\" said Karel Kucera, head of the Czech Banking Association. \"But realistically, I think there are limits to what he can achieve from within the Senate. Many of the biggest issues facing the banking sector will require broader structural reforms that can only be achieved through collaboration with other sectors and government agencies.\"\nDespite such concerns, Turek remains optimistic about his chances of making a difference. He has pledged to work closely with other officials and stakeholders to advance his goals and believes that his experience in the banking sector can be a valuable asset in shaping policy.\n\"If we want to make lasting changes to the banking sector, we need leaders who truly understand the challenges and opportunities facing the industry,\" Turek said. \"I believe that by working collaboratively and drawing on my own experience, we can make significant progress in promoting more responsible and sustainable banking practices.\"\nThe upcoming Senate elections are set to take place in October, with Turek's candidacy drawing significant attention from both the public and the political spheres. As interest in the race continues to grow, many are watching closely to see whether Turek can make good on his promises to clean up the banking sector and promote economic growth and stability in the country.", "The head of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business, John Doherty, has resigned from his position amid a cost-cutting dispute with the company. The sudden resignation, which was announced on Monday, has sent shock waves through the industry, leaving many wondering what the future holds for the aerospace giant.\nDoherty had been leading the company's efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency in the face of increasing competition from other aerospace companies. However, his plans were met with resistance from some senior executives who were concerned that the cost-cutting measures would harm the company's long-term prospects.\nAccording to sources within the company, Doherty had proposed a number of cost-saving measures, including a reduction in workforce and a restructuring of the company's operations. However, these proposals were met with resistance from some senior executives who were concerned about their impact on the company's bottom line.\nFollowing a series of heated discussions, Doherty decided to tender his resignation, saying that he could no longer work in an environment where his proposals were not being taken seriously.\nIn a statement announcing his resignation, Doherty said, \"I am proud of the work that we have done at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business over the past few years. However, it has become clear to me that some of my proposals are not being embraced by all members of the senior executive team. As a result, I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company for me to step down.\"\nDoherty's departure has left many employees and industry analysts wondering what the future holds for the struggling aerospace giant. With increasing competition from other companies and a difficult economic climate, McDonnell Douglas will need to move quickly to find a replacement for Doherty and chart a new course for the company.\nIn the meantime, the company's senior executive team will take over Doherty's responsibilities until a replacement can be found. The search for a new head of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business is expected to begin in the coming weeks.", "Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa, is facing a prolonged dry spell that could negatively impact cocoa pod setting and the main crop growth. The dry spell which began in early April has continued to persist, raising concerns among cocoa farmers in the West African country.\nAccording to cocoa experts, the extended period of dry weather would likely impact pod development and subsequently reduce yields in the coming months. Farmers are already reporting that cocoa trees are showing signs of stress, including wilting leaves and non-flowering pods.\nFurthermore, the prolonged dry spell could have a significant impact on the country's main crop, which is due for harvest later this year. If the dry weather continues, it could lead to a smaller than expected crop, resulting in a significant drop in cocoa export revenues for Ivory Coast.\nLocal authorities have already taken measures to address the situation by providing farmers with water tanks and establishing watering stations in affected regions. However, these efforts may not be enough to prevent a significant drop in yields.\nCocoa production is critical to Ivory Coast's economy, accounting for over 40% of the country's total exports and employing over 5 million people, directly and indirectly. Any significant decline in cocoa production would have a significant impact on national income and employment.\nThe situation in Ivory Coast comes amid growing concern about climate change, which in recent years, has led to more frequent and intense weather events, including droughts, floods and wildfires. The impact of climate change on agriculture is particularly concerning, given the reliance of many developing countries on cash crops such as cocoa for their livelihoods.\nExperts have warned that if the weather patterns continue to shift, countries such as Ivory Coast may face continued declines in production, increased pest attacks, loss of land, and long-term vulnerability to food and livelihood insecurity.\nThe Ivory Coast government has been taking measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on cocoa production, including developing new drought-resistant seed varieties, irrigation systems, and other climate-smart farming practices. However, more needs to be done to manage these challenges effectively.\nThe government has also partnered with international institutions such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank Group to implement climate change adaptation measures and strengthen the resilience of rural livelihoods.\nIn conclusion, the prolonged dry spell in Ivory Coast has raised concerns about a decline in cocoa production this year, which could have implications for the country's economic growth and poverty reduction efforts. Addressing climate change and its impacts on agriculture must be a priority for the government, cocoa stakeholders, and the international community to ensure long-term sustainability of cocoa production and rural livelihoods.", "As BSkyB continues to expand its reach throughout Europe, the company is now reportedly considering further investments in Germany. According to recent reports, this move comes as the company experiences both a rise in profits and subscriber numbers across its various platforms.\nBSkyB has been operating in Germany for the past few years, where it has focused on providing satellite television services to customers throughout the country. This move has proven to be quite successful for the company, as it has steadily increased its subscriber base and revenue in the region.\nNow, with the company's recent financial success, BSkyB is reportedly looking to expand its operations in the country. According to sources close to the situation, the company is considering investing in additional infrastructure across Germany in order to better serve its growing customer base.\nThis could include the construction of new satellite dishes, the expansion of existing infrastructure, or the creation of new services tailored specifically to the German market. Regardless of the specific approach, it is clear that BSkyB is committed to building a strong presence in the country moving forward.\nOf course, this move is not surprising given the recent success of the company's operations in Germany. In a recent financial report, BSkyB announced that its German operations saw a 10% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company reported that its subscriber base in the country now stands at over 5 million - a significant increase from just a few years ago.\nThese figures are no doubt encouraging for BSkyB as it looks to continue its growth trajectory in the region. With a strong foothold in Germany already established, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on its success and further expand its operations in the country.\nOf course, there are still potential challenges ahead for the company. For one, competition in the German market remains fierce, with a number of other satellite providers vying for customers' attention. However, with its reputation for quality service and a commitment to innovation, BSkyB is well-equipped to take on these challenges.\nMoreover, the company's recent investments in technology and infrastructure have helped it stay ahead of the curve in terms of delivering reliable and high-quality services to customers. As BSkyB CEO Jeremy Darroch noted in a recent statement, \"We're committed to investing in the latest technology and infrastructure to ensure our customers get the best possible experience. That's why we're confident we can continue to grow and succeed in Germany and beyond.\"\nOverall, it seems that BSkyB is continuing to make all the right moves as it looks to build a strong presence throughout Europe. With rising profits and subscriber numbers in Germany, the company has reason to be optimistic about its future prospects in the region. And with a renewed commitment to innovation and customer service, BSkyB is poised to continue delivering high-quality services to customers across the continent.", "Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian beer giant, is reportedly exploring joint venture opportunities in India and Vietnam as part of its expansion strategy for the Asian market.\nAccording to industry insiders, the move comes as the company seeks to capitalize on rising demand for premium and craft beers in the region. The joint ventures are expected to enable Foster's to establish a foothold in the Indian and Vietnamese markets, and gain access to a sizable consumer base.\nSources suggest that Foster's is currently in talks with a number of local beer makers and distributors in both India and Vietnam, and is reportedly close to finalizing a deal in Vietnam.\nThe company's move into the Indian market comes at a time when the country's rapidly growing middle class is becoming increasingly interested in premium and imported beers. Foster's is expected to launch a range of premium beers specifically targeted at the Indian market, and is said to be investing heavily in marketing and distribution efforts.\nVietnam, on the other hand, is an established beer market with a strong domestic industry. However, the country has seen a growing trend towards imported craft beers in recent years, presenting an opportunity for Foster's to establish a presence in the market.\nFoster's Brewing Group, which was acquired by Japanese drinks company Asahi in 2020 for $11 billion, is one of the world's leading brewers, with a portfolio of over 200 brands including Carlton Draught, VB, and Peroni. The company has a strong presence in Australia, Asia, and Europe, and has been looking to expand its operations in emerging markets in recent years.\nCommenting on the potential joint ventures, a spokesperson for Foster's said: \"We are always looking for opportunities to expand our business and reach new markets. India and Vietnam are both exciting markets with significant potential, and we believe our premium and craft beers have an excellent opportunity to succeed in these markets.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the company was \"committed to investing in the long-term growth and success of our business, and we will continue to explore opportunities that align with our strategic priorities.\"\nWhile the joint ventures are still in the early stages of negotiation, industry experts believe that Foster's entry into the Indian and Vietnamese markets could have a significant impact on the regional beer industry, and could potentially pave the way for further expansion in the Asian market.", "Hong Kong's former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, could be set to return to power after leading the city in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rumours are swirling that Tung, who was handpicked by Beijing to lead the city of seven million, could return to politics as the next leader of the Special Administrative Region in 2022.\nTung's candidacy would be a significant move for Beijing, which has been grappling with a five-month-long pro-democracy protest movement in the city. Tung, who has Beijing's backing, is best known for his tough stance on dissent and anti-government sentiment, which would likely strike a chord with China's leaders.\nHowever, Tung's road back to power will not be easy. Despite being a successful businessman, he also had to rebuild his reputation after his family's shipping company, Orient Overseas Container Line, faced bankruptcy in the late 1980s.\nTung, who was then the CEO of the company, had to navigate significant losses before finally turning the business around. His success in revitalising the company saw him gain the attention of the Hong Kong government, which appointed him as the city's Chief Executive in 1997.\nDuring his tenure as Chief Executive, Tung was criticised for his close relationship with Beijing and for his handling of political issues in Hong Kong. However, his firm leadership helped to steer the city through the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2008 financial crisis.\nTung's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying, has also been touted as a possible candidate for the next Chief Executive position. However, Leung is viewed by many as being too controversial, with his administration being blamed for fanning the flames of the current protest movement with its hard-line stance against anti-government demonstrators.\nIn contrast, Tung is seen as a more moderate figure who could help to ease tensions in Hong Kong. His pro-business background may also help to appease Beijing, which is currently in the midst of a trade war with the United States.\nHowever, Tung's main challenge will be to win over the people of Hong Kong, who have become increasingly disillusioned with the city's political establishment in recent years. Many Hong Kongers see their leaders as being out of touch with the city's needs and are calling for greater representation and democratic freedoms.\nWhile Tung may be viewed as a more moderate figure than Leung, his close ties to Beijing will be a source of concern for many Hong Kongers. The city's young people, in particular, have been at the forefront of the recent protests and are calling for greater autonomy from China.\nTung will also have to navigate the issue of the extradition bill, which sparked the current protest movement. The bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be tried in mainland China, was eventually withdrawn by the city's government. However, protesters are still calling for its complete withdrawal and for the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\nTung's return to power could be seen as a signal by Beijing that it is doubling down on its hardline approach to Hong Kong. However, Tung's pro-business credentials could also signal a shift in policy, with China looking to pour resources into Hong Kong to boost economic growth.\nRegardless of his precise policies, Tung's return to power would be a significant moment for Hong Kong. Whether he is able to reunite the city and repair its damaged relationship with China remains to be seen.", "The Prague Stock Exchange rebounded on Monday with significant gains from the financial sector shares. This surge in share gains comes after weeks of stunted stock market performance following the recent COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic downturn. \nAccording to market analysts, the rebound is a promising sign for the Czech Republic's overall economic recovery. The Prague Stock Exchange rose by 2.3% on Monday, buoyed by significant gains from the financial sector. Shares from leading banks such as CSOB and Komercni Banka rose by 3.5% and 2.8%, respectively, while insurance providers NN Group and VIG both saw gains of more than 5%. \nThis positive trend is expected to continue, with analysts predicting robust growth for the Prague Stock Exchange in the coming months.

Consequently, lending facilities are likely to expand, and businesses will once again be able to gain access to credit. \nExperts suggest that the recovery of the financial sector is an encouraging sign that the Czech Republic's overall economic stability will improve as well. The economy is likely to strengthen as vaccination rates increase and lockdowns are lifted, allowing businesses to gradually resume operations. Market experts also note that technology companies and electronics retailers have shown impressive resilience during the pandemic and may drive the economic growth in the upcoming weeks. \nThe pandemic outbreak had seriously impacted the global economic landscape, leading to reduced output and shrinking markets.

Market regulations have helped the market rebound, promote transparency, and build investor confidence in the market. The Prague Stock Exchange's favorable performance indicates an optimistic long-term outlook for the country, making it an attractive market for both retail and institutional investors.", "BP and Shanghai Petrochemical have announced their decision to invest in a $2.5 billion ethylene plant in China. The joint venture between two of the world's largest oil companies promises to bring significant benefits to China's petrochemical industry.\nBP will join forces with Shanghai's largest petrochemical company for the construction of this plant in Eastern China's Jiangsu province, which will produce one million tonnes of ethylene per year. The project aims to have a minimal environmental footprint and follow the highest safety standards. Its design envisages a smart and highly integrated plant that will use industry-leading technology to produce high-quality products.\nThe decision to invest in this new venture is a solid step towards BP's plans for decarbonization. BP sees China's growing energy demand as a significant opportunity, with China having committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060. China's recent announcement of its 14th Five-Year Plan also highlights the priority placed on achieving a green transition.\nThe investment demonstrates BP's commitment to partnering with Chinese companies to create low-carbon opportunities that will benefit China and the wider world.

The move comes as part of the company\u2019s efforts to expand its customer base and tap into new market segments. According to a recent statement from the company, the shift will be accompanied by significant investments in research and development, as well as a restructuring of the company\u2019s operations.\nAs part of the shift, Computer Associates is also set to acquire a number of midrange software companies. The move is expected to result in a one-time charge of $500 million, as the company seeks to integrate its new acquisitions into its existing product portfolio. The company\u2019s management has expressed confidence in the move, stating that it will position Computer Associates for growth in the coming years.\nThe shift in focus comes at a time when the enterprise software space is rapidly evolving.

But in March 1997, the company's shares plunged when it was revealed that the Busang deposit was a fraud, consisting of virtually no gold at all.\nNow, almost 25 years after the scandal, Bre-X is once again drawing attention for its operations in Indonesia. The company, which was resurrected as a shell company in 2017, announced in 2019 that it had formed a joint venture with Indonesia's PT Gunung Fajar, which is owned by Tommy Suharto.\nThe news sparked concern among some investors and observers, given Tommy Suharto's controversial reputation. The son of Indonesia's late authoritarian leader, Suharto, Tommy was convicted in 2002 of ordering the murder of a Supreme Court judge and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released in 2006 after serving less than half of his sentence and has since been involved in various business ventures.\nCritics of the Bre-X-PT Gunung Fajar partnership have pointed out that the deal raises questions about the due diligence conducted by Bre-X and the legality of the partnership, given Tommy Suharto's criminal record.\nBre-X, however, has remained tight-lipped on the matter. In response to inquiries from journalists, the company has issued only sparse statements, including one in August 2019 in which it said it was \"fully committed to working within all the applicable laws and regulations in Indonesia.\"\nThe lack of transparency from Bre-X has only fueled speculation about the nature of the partnership and the potential risks involved for investors.\nSome observers have noted that Bre-X's dealings in Indonesia are not the only cause for concern. The company's current CEO, David Walsh, was one of the central figures in the 1997 fraud scandal and was criticized at the time for failing to properly oversee the company's exploration efforts in Busang. And the company's recent resurrection as a shell company has also raised eyebrows, with some accusing it of attempting to wipe the slate clean and distance itself from its checkered past.\nDespite these concerns, Bre-X has continued to pursue its operations in Indonesia. In November 2019, the company announced that it had signed a deal with a third-party company to begin exploration work at its Busang project, which is located in the same region where the 1997 fraud occurred.\nThe company has also announced that it is raising funds to pursue its operations, including through the sale of shares. According to recent filings with Canadian regulators, the company has raised more than $9 million through the sale of shares since 2017.\nBre-X's silence on the issues surrounding its Indonesian partnership and its past track record has worried some observers, who are calling for greater transparency from the company.\nSpeaking to the Financial Post, John Godec, a mining investment advisor and former head of mining research at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said: \"Investors would like to see greater transparency from the company regarding its plans and its partnerships. The track record of both Bre-X and Tommy Suharto raises some red flags, and investors want to be sure that any risks associated with the company's operations are being properly disclosed and managed.\"\nAs Bre-X continues to pursue its operations in Indonesia, the company will likely face mounting pressure to address these concerns and provide greater transparency to investors. With the ghosts of its past still haunting it, the company will need to show that it can navigate the tricky terrain of the mining industry with greater care and responsibility in order to win back the trust of investors.", "Nestle SA, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company, has seen a spectacular surge in growth in China over the past few years, driven by changing consumer tastes and the establishment of new factories in the country.\nAccording to a recent report, Nestle SA's sales in China jumped by 22% in 2020, outpacing the overall growth rate of the country's food and beverage market. This remarkable growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rise of the middle class in China, changing consumer preferences, and Nestle's strategy of expanding its presence in lower-tier cities.\nOne of the key drivers of Nestle's success in China has been its ability to adapt its products to the preferences of Chinese consumers. For instance, the company has introduced new flavors and packaging for its popular KitKat chocolate bars, such as green tea and strawberry flavors. It has also launched new products like the Starbucks-branded coffee and milk tea drinks, which have proven to be a hit among Chinese consumers.\nNestle has also been investing heavily in building new factories and expanding its operations in China. In September 2020, the company opened a new $100 million factory in Shandong province, which will produce a range of dairy products for Chinese consumers. This follows the opening of a new factory in Tianjin in 2019, which produces Nescafe coffee and is the largest coffee factory in Asia.\nIn addition to its factory expansion, Nestle has been working to expand its distribution network in China, particularly in lower-tier cities where there is significant untapped market potential. The company has been partnering with local retailers and e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com to reach more consumers across the country.\nOverall, Nestle's success in China is a testament to its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. With its continued investments in new factories and distribution channels, the company is well-positioned to maintain its momentum in the Chinese market for years to come.", "Sainsbury's, one of the UK's largest supermarket chains, has launched its own banking services in partnership with Bank of Scotland. The move comes as the supermarket looks to build on its existing financial services offering, and marks its entry into the competitive retail banking space. \nSainsbury's Bank will offer a range of products including personal loans, credit cards, and savings accounts, as well as insurance and mortgages. The supermarket has also pledged to offer competitive rates and rewards programmes to attract customers. \nSpeaking about the launch, Sainsbury's CEO Simon Roberts said: \"As a trusted brand with millions of customers across the UK, we are well-placed to offer banking services that meet their changing financial needs. We are excited to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, which shares our commitment to customer service and innovation.\" \nThe partnership with Bank of Scotland will see a range of banking services integrated into Sainsbury's stores, giving customers the convenience of being able to manage their banking and shopping in one place. Sainsbury's Bank will also offer digital banking and mobile app services. \nThe move into banking is a major strategic shift for Sainsbury's, which has been steadily expanding its financial services offering over the past decade. In 2013, the supermarket bought out Lloyds' stake in Sainsbury's Bank, giving it full control of the business. Since then, it has expanded into travel and pet insurance, as well as personal loans and credit cards. \nWith its new banking offering, Sainsbury's will compete with established banks such as Barclays, HSBC, and Lloyds. It will also face competition from other retailers, such as Tesco and M&S, which already have their own banking services. \nIndustry experts have praised Sainsbury's for being the first of the big four supermarkets to launch its own full-service bank. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: \"Sainsbury's is taking a smart, low-risk and potentially high-reward step into the retail banking space. Its established customer base gives it an advantage over other new entrants, and the partnership with Bank of Scotland should ensure a smooth launch.\" \nHowever, others have warned that Sainsbury's may struggle to compete with the big banks, which have much larger customer bases and more resources. David Watts, a banking consultant at McKinsey, said: \"Sainsbury's will need to offer something truly unique to entice customers away from the established banks. It will also need to invest heavily in customer service and technology to stay competitive.\" \nDespite the challenges, Sainsbury's is optimistic about the potential of its banking offering. According to a recent survey by the supermarket, nearly half of its customers said they would be interested in using its banking services. Sainsbury's Bank CEO Cathy Smith said: \"We believe there is a huge opportunity to expand our financial services offering and become a major player in the banking market. With our strong brand and the support of Bank of Scotland, we are confident of success.\" \nThe launch of Sainsbury's Bank represents a major milestone for the UK retail banking sector, which has seen increasing competition from non-traditional players in recent years. With its established customer base and innovative products, Sainsbury's looks set to shake up the market and give the big banks a run for their money.", "Food Lion, one of the largest grocery store chains in the country, has made a bold move to acquire Kash n\u2019 Karry in a deal worth $341 million. The merger is set to bring significant changes to the grocery industry in the United States, as both chains have a strong presence in the Southeast.\nThe acquisition of Kash n\u2019 Karry by Food Lion has been in the works for several months. The deal is expected to be finalized by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval. Once completed, Kash n\u2019 Karry stores will be rebranded as Food Lion, and the two companies will combine operations.\nFood Lion\u2019s CEO, Kevin Holt, spoke to the media about the new acquisition, saying that the deal is a \"strategic decision\" for both companies. He highlighted that the acquisition will expand Food Lion's footprint in Florida, where Kash n\u2019 Karry has a significant presence. He added that the merger will also help Food Lion to enhance its supply chain and \u201cdeliver greater value and convenience\u201d to customers.\nThe acquisition of Kash n' Karry will give Food Lion access to the grocery chain\u2019s 49 stores located in Florida, which will add to the over 1,000 stores that the chain already operates across the East Coast. With this acquisition, Food Lion will now be able to better compete in the highly competitive grocery industry, where retailers continually look for ways to drive down prices.\nSome analysts have hailed the merger as a good move for Food Lion, as it will give them a competitive edge against rivals like Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon. Jamie Katz, an industry analyst at Morningstar, said that the acquisition will allow Food Lion to expand its reach in Florida, a state that is experiencing rapid population growth. She added that the changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic have made this acquisition more important, as shoppers demand convenience and speed.\nFor Kash n\u2019 Karry, the merger is an opportunity to join forces with an established brand with deeper pockets. Kash n\u2019 Karry has been struggling in recent years, as they try to keep up with the competition. Food Lion\u2019s acquisition will allow the chain to improve their offerings while also benefiting from their new partner\u2019s resources.\nThe two grocery chains have not yet discussed how the merger will affect their employees. However, experts suggest that redundancies are likely, and employees may face changes in their roles in the new merged companies.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Kash n\u2019 Karry by Food Lion in a deal worth $341 million is set to bring significant changes to the grocery industry in the Southeastern United States. The merger will help Food Lion expand its reach in Florida, improve its supply chain and allow it to better compete with rivals. For Kash n\u2019 Karry, it provides the opportunity to strengthen their offerings and benefit from their strong partner\u2019s resources. However, what remains to be seen is how this merger will affect employees in the long run.", "Air China, the country's flagship carrier, has announced that it will be expanding its international routes and adding five new planes to its fleet. \nThe company's president, Cai Jianjiang, said the expansion will enable the airline to better serve its international customers and meet growing demand for travel and air cargo transportation. \n\"We are excited to announce our plan to expand our international routes and to add more planes to our fleet,\" Jianjiang said. \"This is a significant milestone in our journey to become one of the world's leading airlines.\"\nAccording to Jianjiang, Air China will be adding two Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners and three Airbus A350-900s to its fleet in 2021. The company will use these new planes to expand its international routes to cities in Europe, the Americas and Australia.\nIn addition to expanding its international network, Air China will also introduce new services on its existing routes. This includes the launch of a new business class cabin on select flights, as well as enhanced inflight entertainment and Wi-Fi services.\nThe expansion comes as China's aviation market continues to rebound from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent months, domestic travel has picked up, with airlines adding more flights and introducing new destinations.\nHowever, with international travel still facing restrictions in many countries, Air China's expansion is aimed at capturing a larger share of the global market once travel resumes.\nAir China's announcement also comes at a time when many airlines around the world are struggling to stay afloat due to the ongoing pandemic. With its strong financial standing and expanding fleet, Air China is well positioned to weather the storm and emerge as a major player in the global aviation industry. \nAs airlines around the world continue to grapple with the impact of the pandemic, Air China's expansion plans are a sign of optimism for the future of the aviation industry. With increased connectivity and new services, the airline is poised to capture the growing demand for air travel once international borders reopen.", "Compaq Computer Corp. announced today that it had achieved a sharp rise in profit, with a 43% jump in the third quarter of the year, with sales boosting and streamlined operations. The result is seen as yet another milestone for the company in its remarkable turnaround since CEO Michael Capellas took over in early 2000.\nAccording to the report, the company's net income stood at $357 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $249 million, or 15 cents per share, in the same quarter in 1999. This earnings performance also surprised Wall Street analysts, who had estimated earnings of only 15 cents per share.\n\"We feel great about our performance in the third quarter,\" Capellas said in a statement. \"We exceeded our financial objectives due to strong growth in key product areas and solid execution of our operational efficiency initiatives.\"\nSales for the quarter also grew by 22% to $10.14 billion compared with $8.32 billion in the same period last year. This jump was driven by strong revenue growth in the company's business computing, storage, and consumer products divisions. Compaq has worked hard to reduce its PC business as it looks to bolster other areas.\nIn recent years, Compaq had struggled to compete in the PC market, with stiff competition from Dell and Hewlett-Packard. But the company has now refocused on high-margin businesses, including servers, storage, and software, with considerable success.\nThe company's operational improvements have also helped boost its bottom line. Compaq has implemented a series of cost-cutting measures over the past year, such as plant closures, job cuts, and reductions in capital spending. These moves have allowed the company to achieve greater efficiency and stronger profitability.\nCompaq's PC sales, however, were stagnant, with sales even dropping slightly to $2.68 billion from $2.69 billion. The company has pointed to a slow PC market and significant competition in this space.\nDespite the challenges, Compaq's CEO remains optimistic about the company's prospects. \"We believe that our focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, along with our operational improvements, will result in continued profitability and shareholder value,\" Capellas said.\nThe earnings announcement is likely to give a boost to the company's stock. Compaq shares were down more than 50% earlier this year but have since rebounded, thanks in part to strong earnings reports.\nCompaq's success also comes amid a broader revival in the technology industry, which has long taken a beating due to concerns about overhyped valuations and a downturn in the American economy. But now, with the economy gradually rebounding, technology companies like Compaq are well positioned to profit.\nThe Compaq earnings report caps off a strong quarter for the technology industry. IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard have all recently reported strong earnings. Industry analysts suggest that this bodes well for the technology industry going forward and could signify the end of the technology industry's troubles.\nWith stronger revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a refocused business focus, Compaq Computer Corp. appears set for continued success in the months ahead. Investors and industry analysts alike will no doubt keep an eye on the company's progress as it continues its impressive turnaround story.", "As China prepares to take full control of Hong Kong, Britain has proposed a set of laws concerning subversion in the once independent city. The new laws are aimed at protecting the rights of Hong Kong citizens, many of whom are fearful of Chinese rule, and maintaining the autonomy of the region.\nUnder the proposed laws, any individual or organization found guilty of subversion would face punishment including fines and imprisonment. The laws would also target foreign interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs, a concern shared by many in the region.\nThe proposed laws come in response to increasing Chinese influence in the city. In recent years, Beijing has cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, with pro-independence activists facing arrest and imprisonment. The new laws proposed by Britain aim to counter this trend and safeguard the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nThe proposed laws have been met with mixed reactions. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have welcomed the move, with many calling it a step in the right direction for the protection of human rights in the city. Others, however, have voiced concerns over the potential for the laws to be used to suppress dissent in the region.\nSupporters of the proposed laws argue that they are necessary to counter Chinese influence in the region and protect the rights of Hong Kong citizens. They argue that the laws will give Hong Kong a greater degree of autonomy and independence, and will help to maintain its status as a global financial hub.\nHowever, opponents of the proposed laws argue that they will do little to protect human rights in the region. They argue that the laws are more about posturing and protecting British interests in the region than they are about protecting the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nDespite the mixed reactions to the proposed laws, it is clear that the issue of Hong Kong's autonomy and independence is one that will continue to generate debate and controversy in the coming years. As China's influence in the region continues to grow, the question of how to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and independence will become increasingly pressing.\nThe proposed laws come at a time when tensions between the UK and China are already high. In recent months, the two countries have clashed over issues such as the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China, and the presence of Huawei in the UK's 5G network.\nThe proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong are likely to further strain relations between the two countries, with China already warning of unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the laws are passed.\nThe situation in Hong Kong is complex, and it is unclear what the future holds for the city. With China set to take full control of the region, many are left wondering whether Hong Kong's autonomy and independence will survive.\nFor the time being, however, Britain's proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong offer a glimmer of hope for those who believe in the importance of human rights and democracy in the region. While they may not be a perfect solution to the problem of Chinese influence in Hong Kong, they represent a step in the right direction for the protection of the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nAs the debate over Hong Kong's autonomy and independence continues, it is clear that the world will be watching closely to see how events unfold. For now, however, the proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong offer a glimpse of hope for those who believe in the importance of human rights and democracy in the region.", "In a move that comes as welcome news for American poultry exporters, China has announced a delay in the planned ban on U.S. poultry imports. The ban, which was supposed to take effect on January 1, 2021, has been postponed by an unspecified period to allow for further discussions on quarantine protocols.\nChina's decision to delay the ban follows a request from U.S. trade officials who have been pressing their Chinese counterparts to reconsider the move. American industry groups have been lobbying aggressively against the ban, arguing that it would create severe economic hardship for U.S. poultry farmers and exporters.\nChina imposed the ban in response to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in South Carolina, which prompted the Chinese government to suspend imports from the state. However, the U.S. government and industry groups have argued that the ban is unscientific and unfair, as other countries have not imposed similar measures.\nThe U.S. government has been pushing for a resolution to the issue, and President Trump reportedly raised the matter during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit last month. The two countries have agreed to continue discussions on the issue, with a view to reaching a resolution that is satisfactory to both sides.\nIn a statement, China's General Administration of Customs (GAC) said that it would \"continue to communicate with the U.S. side on quarantine requirements for imported poultry\" and urged the U.S. to \"take effective measures to prevent the spread of HPAI.\"\nThe U.S. poultry industry has welcomed the news of the delay, but expressed concern that the issue has yet to be resolved. Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, said that while the delay was good news, it was \"critical\" that progress was made in resolving the issue.\n\"We are pleased that the Chinese government has recognized the importance and complexity of this issue and the need for further discussions,\" Sumner said in a statement. \"However, time is running out, and we urge both governments to work together to reach a resolution that allows for the continued trade of U.S. poultry with China.\"\nThe U.S. is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of poultry, with exports valued at around $5 billion annually. China is one of the largest markets for U.S. poultry, with shipments estimated at $500 million in 2019.\nIf the ban were to go ahead, it would be a significant blow to the U.S. poultry industry, which is already grappling with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay in the ban gives both sides more time to resolve the issue, but industry groups remain concerned that a final resolution may not be reached in time.", "In a sharp call for increased transparency in Chinese listed companies, a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official has urged China to adopt more open reporting practices, raising concerns over inadequate disclosure standards and the risks to foreign investors.\nEchoing the concerns of many investors, Paul Hastings, director of the SEC\u2019s Office of International Affairs, said that high-quality disclosure is particularly crucial for those investing across borders and this is something still lacking in many Chinese firms.\nAddressing a conference in Beijing, Hastings urged China to adopt international standards, asserting that trustworthy financial information is fundamental to creating a sustainable and healthy capital market.\nHe expressed his concerns about the lack of transparency, requesting that China take a disciplined approach towards their financial disclosure practices, especially for cross-border investors who are particularly reliant on the accuracy of public information.\nFor years, the US has tried to get China to agree to its own demands for more transparency. However, Hastings\u2019s call for China to adopt international standards is the latest sign of tension concerning one of the most contentious issues in the economic relationship between the US and China.\nThere has long been criticism among Western investors that Chinese public companies have opaque and inadequate accounting practices, which translates into a real risk for investors looking to do business in China.\nMany have also expressed their concerns about the number of Chinese companies that are listed on US stock exchanges, pointing out that these companies may not be trustworthy in their reporting practices. This has led to increased interest in better regulation and oversight of Chinese investment.\nBut Hastings\u2019s comments come at a time of heightened tension between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trading practices and has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods.\nThe US President has also issued executive orders aimed at limiting the amount of securities investments Chinese companies can make in US companies, which has fueled concern among international investors about the potential impact of this tension on foreign investment in China.\nHowever, Hastings emphasized the importance of transparency in global capital markets, urging China to adopt international standards and best practices. This, he said, would help build trust with investors and create a sustainable environment for cross-border investments, which is essential for the continued growth of the global economy.", "KPMG, one of the world's largest professional services firms, is on track for revenue growth thanks to its investment in infrastructure and technology, according to the firm's chairman, Bill Thomas.\nThomas spoke to reporters at the firm's annual results briefing in London on Wednesday, announcing that KPMG's revenue had increased by 3.7% to \u00a32.3bn in the UK last year.\nHe attributed the growth to the firm's investment in new technologies and infrastructure, which he said had helped to drive efficiencies and improve client services.\n\"Our investment in technology and infrastructure has enabled us to modernise our business and build deeper relationships with our clients,\" Thomas said. \"We're seeing the benefits of this in our revenue growth and our ability to deliver more value to our clients.\"\nKPMG has been investing heavily in new technologies in recent years, including artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics, which the firm says are helping it to deliver more innovative and efficient services to its clients.\nThe firm has also been investing in infrastructure to support its growing business, including a new office in London's Canary Wharf and a new data centre in Bristol.\nThomas said that the investments were starting to pay off, with the firm seeing strong growth in a number of key areas, including audit and advisory services, as well as tax and financial reporting.\nThe firm's success has also been bolstered by its focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility, which Thomas said had become increasingly important for clients and employees alike.\n\"We recognise the importance of sustainable business practices and the role that we can play in promoting them,\" he said. \"This is not only good for our clients and the environment, but it's also good for our business by attracting and retaining the best talent.\"\nDespite the positive results, Thomas acknowledged that the firm still faced challenges, including ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing regulatory pressures facing the accounting industry.\nHe called for greater clarity on Brexit and urged the government to provide more support for UK businesses to help them navigate the complexities of the UK's departure from the EU.\nHe also stressed the need for the accounting industry to maintain high standards and regain public trust, following a number of high-profile scandals that have undermined confidence in the sector.\n\"We recognise that we have a responsibility to rebuild public trust in our profession and to ensure that we maintain the highest ethical and professional standards,\" he said.\nOverall, however, Thomas was optimistic about KPMG's future prospects, saying that the firm remained committed to delivering innovative and efficient services to clients, and to investing in the technologies and infrastructure that would help to drive growth.\n\"We're confident that our investment in the future will continue to pay off, not just in terms of revenue growth but also in terms of our ability to make a positive impact on the world,\" he said. \"That's what our clients want, and that's what we're here to deliver.\"", "AMEC Plc, a leading engineering and project management company, is reportedly exploring a potential investment in French electrical and construction company Spie Batignolles. According to sources familiar with the matter, AMEC is considering buying a stake in Spie's electrical and construction businesses to expand its international exposure and diversify its portfolio.\nThe potential deal is said to be in its early stages, and neither company has publicly commented on the matter. However, industry insiders believe that a partnership between the two companies could be mutually beneficial, as AMEC's expertise in engineering and project management could complement Spie's existing capabilities and help the French company expand its reach in global markets.\nAMEC Plc, which is headquartered in London, has a strong track record of delivering major infrastructure projects around the world. The company operates in a range of sectors, including oil and gas, mining, power, and transportation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in several of these industries, making it increasingly important for AMEC to diversify its revenue streams and explore new opportunities for growth.\nSpie Batignolles, headquartered in Levallois-Perret, France, is a major player in the construction and electrical engineering industries. The company has a presence in several countries, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, and has a strong reputation for delivering complex and high-profile projects. In recent years, Spie has shifted its focus towards renewable energy and other environmentally-friendly technologies, in an effort to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly-changing industry.\nA potential investment in Spie Batignolles would allow AMEC to tap into the French company's expertise in these areas, while also gaining a foothold in the European market. The move could also help AMEC capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy and other sustainable technologies, as governments around the world invest heavily in infrastructure that supports decarbonization.\nWhile the potential investment is still in its early stages, industry experts have expressed optimism about the possibilities it could create. If the two companies are able to successfully partner, they could create a powerful force in the global infrastructure sector, offering a wide range of engineering and project management services to clients around the world.", "Manchester United\u2019s shares have surged to record highs following rumors of a possible takeover bid by billionaire Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The news has created a buzz amongst investors, analysts and fans alike as they await confirmation of a potential $4 billion deal for the club.\nOn Monday morning, the shares of the club jumped by 5% to $18.30, the highest they have been since early 2018. This stock market rally followed news of fresh investment by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which has purchased a stake of around $1.5 billion in Manchester United.\nThe potential takeover could create a huge change for the club, who has struggled to regain the form and success they enjoyed in previous decades. With the new investment and support, Manchester United could much more easily chase after the best players and make transfers that will help improve their team.\nHowever, there is also the possibility that fans may protest the acquisition by the controversial Crown Prince, who has been accused of human rights abuses by several media outlets. Furthermore, investors are concerned about the potential backlash and criticisms that could arise from this takeover bid, especially in the wake of the recent Jamal Khashoggi scandal.\nDespite the controversies surrounding the Crown Prince, many analysts believe that the investment in Manchester United makes sound business sense. The club is one of the biggest and most successful in the world of football, with a large and passionate fan-base that stretches across the globe. This huge fan-base provides the club with strong revenues from ticket sales, merchandise, broadcasting rights, and sponsorship deals.\nMoreover, the club is situated in the lucrative English Premier League, which has grown to be one of the most lucrative football leagues in the world. Since the EPL\u2019s formation in 1992, it has become one of the wealthiest sports leagues, attracting significant amounts of investment and international attention.\nWhilst Manchester United has faced a slump in recent seasons, the club\u2019s competitive history means that they remain a popular team for fans and investors alike. Manchester United has won 20 Premier League trophies, more than any other team in the league, as well as three European cups and a FIFA Club World Cup.\nThe club is also renowned for its ability to command high transfer fees, with record-breaking deals such as the \u00a389 million purchase of Paul Pogba. The club has the resources and ambition to compete with the very best in the sport, and this is likely what has attracted the Saudi Arabian prince\u2019s interest.\nWith the potential takeover, there is a new sense of excitement and hope amongst Manchester United fans. Supporters of the team have long argued that the club has been mismanaged in recent years, with poor signings, frequent changes in management, and a lack of success.\nThe new investment would allow the club to rebuild and restore itself, and there is the potential for the club to experience a resurgence in form and success. This would undoubtedly please the millions of fans who support the club, wishing to see Manchester United return to the sustained success they enjoyed under Alex Ferguson, in particular when they won the famous \u201ctreble\u201d in 1999.\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the potential takeover, the surge in Manchester United\u2019s share prices indicates that investors are feeling optimistic. Whilst there is no guarantee that the deal will go through, the fact that the club is now attracting the interest of one of the world\u2019s richest men means that a new era could be on the horizon for the club.\nIn this sense, the rumors of the takeover bid have sparked positive headlines and new discussions around one of the biggest football clubs in the world. Manchester United\u2019s shareholders, fans, and football enthusiasts alike now eagerly await further developments in what is becoming one of the biggest takeover sagas in football history.", "In a significant move towards ensuring public health safety, the Chinese government has launched a national drive to test all blood products for HIV contamination. This initiative is expected to play a crucial role in reducing the number of HIV infections in the country.\nIn recent years, China has witnessed a steady rise in the number of people living with HIV. According to official figures released by the National Health Commission, China has an estimated 950,000 HIV-positive people, with the actual number of cases potentially being much higher, since many people may not have been tested. HIV is primarily spread through sexual contact, contaminated needles, and from mother to child during childbirth. Contaminated blood products are another significant source of HIV transmission.\nThe new initiative to test all blood products is aimed at strengthening the safeguards around the quality of the country's blood supply. The Chinese government has provided additional funding to blood centers and hospitals across the country to enable them to procure the necessary equipment and conduct the tests. The initiative is expected to take several months to complete, but the government has indicated its commitment to ensuring that all blood products used in the country are safe.\nThe move is also significant given China's historic struggles with contaminated blood products. In the 1990s, the country experienced a significant outbreak of HIV infections due to the widespread use of contaminated blood products. At the time, many blood centers were run by commercial enterprises that placed profits over health and safety. This led to a significant number of people being infected with HIV and hepatitis C.\nSince then, the government has made significant strides in improving the safety of the country's blood supply. However, the recent rise in HIV infections has prompted the authorities to take further action. The new initiative is expected to ensure that China's blood supply remains safe and free from contamination.\nThe move has been welcomed by health experts, who see it as a significant step towards reducing the number of people living with HIV in China. The initiative is expected to contribute to the country's efforts to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS by 2030.\nIn conclusion, the Chinese government's decision to launch a national drive to test all blood products for HIV contamination is a significant step towards ensuring public health safety in the country. The initiative is expected to help reduce the number of new HIV infections and play a crucial role in China's efforts to end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS by 2030.", "The Hong Kong government has been working on new overflight arrangements with Beijing, ahead of the 1997 handover of the territory to China. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said that the negotiations were still ongoing, but that the parties were making progress.\nThe negotiations are aimed at ensuring that the airlines of all countries can continue to use Hong Kong as an air traffic hub, even after the territory becomes part of China. Currently, Hong Kong is subject to international aviation regulations, and many airlines use the city as a convenient transfer point for flights between different countries.\nThe new arrangements would guarantee that airlines can continue to use Hong Kong as a transit point, without having to comply with new, potentially restrictive, regulations after the handover. The Hong Kong government has been keen to reassure the aviation industry and the travelling public that there will be no disruption to air services after 1997.\nObservers have noted that the negotiations are part of the wider process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. The territory is currently ruled by the British, but this will change on 1 July 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong is transferred to Beijing under the terms of a treaty signed in 1984. The treaty also guarantees that Hong Kong will retain many of its existing freedoms and rights under a system known as \"one country, two systems\".\nThe aviation negotiations are seen as an important step in ensuring that Hong Kong can maintain its position as a major economic and transportation hub in East Asia. The city is strategically located at the crossroads of major air routes between Asia and Europe, and many airlines use it as a hub for flights to other parts of Asia, Australia, and beyond.\nHong Kong is also home to one of the world's busiest container ports, and has a thriving financial sector. The territory's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, and is seen as a model of efficient, market-oriented development in Asia.\nThe aviation negotiations are just one part of the complex process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. Nevertheless, they are seen as an important symbol of the commitment of the Hong Kong government to maintaining the territory's position as a leading center for international trade, commerce, and finance in the region.", "Associated British Foods (ABF) has reported a 15% increase in profits in the past year, however, the chairman, Michael McLintock, has expressed caution about the year ahead due to political uncertainties surrounding Brexit.\nABF, which owns brands such as Twinings, Primark, and Kingsmill, reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.36bn for the year up until September 15, which represents an increase of \u00a3178m from last year. The company's revenue also increased by 1% to \u00a315.6bn.\nThe Profits were driven by the strong performance of Primark, which saw a rise in sales of 6%, boosting overall sales to \u00a37.8bn. ABF's grocery business also saw a 1% increase in sales to reach \u00a33.5bn, with Twinings and Ovaltine standing out as strong performers.\nHowever, in his statement, McLintock warned that the company faced challenges ahead, largely due to the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding Brexit. \"The UK\u2019s departure from the EU creates uncertainty,\" he said. \"The complexity and range of issues is daunting. Currently, significant uncertainty remains over the outcome and timing of a UK departure from the EU, and the nature of the future relationship.\"\nHe further highlighted the potential presence of trade barriers and tariff changes in the months to come and the fact that the UK and EU are yet to establish a trade agreement. McLintock added that the company is planning for all eventualities but admitted the situation is challenging.\nDespite the uncertainty, McLintock also spoke positively about the progress the company has made in the development of its sugar division. ABF is the largest sugar producer in Africa and has been investing heavily in the region in recent years. These investments are already starting to pay off, with revenue from the division increasing by 38% to \u00a31.93bn.\nThe company has also recently invested heavily in its agriculture business, including the development of new technologies for crop production, the introduction of new products such as animal feed, and the expansion of its global reach. Plans are underway for ABF to acquire 2,000 hectares of new farmland in China, while in Europe, the company has partnered with another firm to develop a grain terminal in the Port of Bar in Montenegro.\nWhile McLintock's warning is justified, some analysts believe the company is in a strong position to weather the political difficulties ahead. Analyst James Edwardes Jones from RBC Capital Markets said, \"ABF has got a well-diversified business with a lot of resilience, so even with the current political uncertainty, it's well-positioned.\"\nIndeed, ABF's success in recent years has been due in part to its diversified business model, which has allowed it to weather previous economic uncertainties, including the 2008 recession.\nOverall, ABF's strong financial results are a cause for optimism, but the chairman's caution highlights the challenges that lie ahead. As the political situation remains unpredictable, the company will need to remain vigilant and adaptable if it is to continue its upward trajectory.", "In what is shaping up to be one of the most significant shifts in the banking industry in recent memory, several major banks are jockeying for position in an emerging private banking super-league.\nIt's been no secret that private banking has been undergoing a significant transformation over the past few years, with the rise of new technology and changing customer expectations setting the stage for a potentially seismic shift.\nBut while many have predicted a gradual, decentralized evolution in the sector, recent reports suggest that some of the biggest names in banking are gearing up for a more aggressive approach.\nAccording to industry insiders, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup are among the banks that are currently in the process of retooling their private banking services in an effort to compete for a share of the market.\nAnd while each of these banks has unique strengths and weaknesses, they all share a common goal: to create a comprehensive, high-tech, and customer-centric private banking platform that can compete with the best in the business.\nFor JP Morgan, this means building on its existing strength in wealth management and expanding its offerings to better serve customers in emerging markets. The bank has already made significant investments in this area, with recent hires including former HSBC executive Joaquim Levy and former Goldman Sachs executive David Holstein.\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, is taking a more aggressive approach, launching a new arm dedicated to serving ultra-high-net-worth clients. Dubbed the \"Private Wealth Management Group,\" this division will focus on providing tailored investment advice and customized solutions to clients with at least $10 million in investable assets.\nFor Citigroup, the focus seems to be on expanding its reach in existing markets. The bank has recently made a number of strategic hires in Asia, including former Deutsche Bank executive Mary Kate Gulick, as it seeks to capture a larger share of the rapidly growing wealth in the region.\nBut regardless of the specific strategies employed by each bank, the overarching goal is clear: to stake a claim in what many experts believe could be the future of private banking.\nSo what does this mean for customers? For one thing, it could mean a more dynamic and competitive environment, with banks offering new and innovative services in an effort to attract and retain clients.\nBut it could also lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few large players, potentially limiting choice and creating new risks for consumers.\nAs with any major shift in the financial industry, there are likely to be winners and losers. However, one thing is certain: the emerging private banking super-league is poised to play a major role in shaping the future of this critical sector, and those who are best able to adapt and innovate will be the ones that come out on top.", "California's high-tech industry has soared after a costly ballot proposal that would have severely impacted their businesses was defeated in the recent elections.\nThe ballot proposal, known as Proposition 22, aimed to classify workers in gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft as employees instead of independent contractors. This would have required these companies to offer benefits and protections such as health insurance, sick leave, and minimum wage to their workers.\nHowever, these companies argued that such a move would have drastically increased their costs, making it impossible for them to operate profitably. They spent millions of dollars campaigning against the proposal, arguing that it would lead to job losses and reduced services for consumers.\nThe proposition was fiercely debated, with both sides arguing passionately for their cause. In the end, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 58% to 42%.\nThe defeat of Proposition 22 has been a major boost for the high-tech industry in California. Companies that were facing the prospects of lower profits and uncertain futures are now seeing their stocks soar.\nUber and Lyft, for instance, saw their stocks rise by 11% and 14%, respectively, following the defeat of the proposal. Other gig economy companies such as DoorDash, Postmates, and Instacart are also experiencing significant gains.\nThis surge in stock prices shows that investors were relieved at the outcome of the vote. Many of these companies had threatened to leave California if the proposal had passed, causing concerns about their futures.\nThe CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, welcomed the defeat of the proposal, stating that it was a great day for drivers and riders. He praised the voters for understanding the importance of preserving the flexibility and independence of drivers who choose to work for these companies.\nSimilarly, John Zimmer, the co-founder of Lyft, stated that the defeat of Proposition 22 would allow their company to continue providing affordable, reliable transportation to millions of Californians.\nWhile the high-tech companies are celebrating, there are concerns among workers and labor unions about the impact of the defeat of the proposal.\nMany labor unions, which had supported the proposal, argued that drivers and delivery workers deserve better protections and benefits. They worry that these workers will continue to be exploited by these companies, which will not offer them the basic rights that they are entitled to as employees.\nIn a statement, the California Labor Federation stated that they were disappointed at the defeat of the proposal but would continue to fight for the rights of workers in the gig economy.\nDespite these concerns, the defeat of Proposition 22 is seen as a significant victory for the high-tech industry. It is likely to strengthen the position of these companies in the state and encourage them to invest more in their operations.\nIt also sends a message to other states and jurisdictions that may consider similar proposals in the future. The high-tech companies have shown that they are willing to spend millions of dollars to protect their interests, and that they have the ability to mobilize supporters to vote against such proposals.\nIn conclusion, the defeat of Proposition 22 is a significant win for California's high-tech industry. It allows these companies to continue operating as they have been, providing flexibility and independence to their drivers and delivery workers.\nWhile there may be concerns about the impact on workers, the outcome of the vote shows that the voice of the business community was heard loud and clear. The future of the gig economy in California is now more certain, and investors are confident that these companies will continue to deliver strong returns.", "The Czech government is facing a challenging decision on how to diversify its gas supplies in order to reduce its dependence on Russia. The situation has become critical in light of recent geopolitical tensions and the threat of potential gas supply disruptions.\nThe Czech Republic currently imports around two-thirds of its gas from Russia, making it highly reliant on a single source. This puts the country in a vulnerable position, particularly in light of Russia's history of using gas as a political weapon in its disputes with other European countries.\nIn addition, the Czech Republic is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its reliance on Russian gas and to increase energy security through diversification. The EU is looking to create a unified energy market and reduce its dependence on Russian gas in order to avoid being held hostage to political disputes between Russia and other European countries.\nThe Czech government has been considering various options for reducing its dependence on Russian gas. One possibility is to increase the country's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only a small percentage of overall demand. However, this would require significant investment and a long-term strategy.\nAnother option is to diversify imports by building new gas infrastructure, such as interconnectors with neighboring countries. This would allow the Czech Republic to tap into other gas sources, such as Norway, Azerbaijan, and the US. However, these projects are also expensive and require significant planning and coordination.\nThe Czech Republic is also exploring the possibility of importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from other countries. LNG is a form of natural gas that is cooled to a liquid state for easier transport and storage. It can be imported from anywhere in the world, providing greater flexibility and security.\nThe government has already taken some steps towards diversifying gas supplies. In 2019, it signed a deal with Poland to build a new gas pipeline between the two countries, which would allow the Czech Republic to access alternative gas supplies from the Baltic Sea region.\nThe Czech Republic has also been negotiating with the US and Qatar over potential LNG imports. In July 2020, the country signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar on energy cooperation, which includes the exploration of LNG imports. The Czech government has also announced plans to build an LNG terminal in the northern city of Decin, which would allow it to import LNG from various sources.\nHowever, these efforts have been met with resistance from Russia, which sees the diversification of gas supplies as a threat to its dominant position in the European gas market. In September 2019, a senior Russian official warned the Czech Republic against building an LNG terminal, stating that it would be a \"detrimental project\". Russian gas giant, Gazprom, has also been accused of using its dominant position in the Czech gas market to block competition.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Czech government must decide on a long-term strategy for reducing its dependence on Russian gas. This will require careful planning and coordination with other EU countries, as well as investment in new infrastructure and technologies.\nThe geopolitical situation in Europe is constantly evolving, and gas supply disruptions are a real threat. The Czech Republic must ensure that it is not held hostage to political disputes and that it can secure the energy it needs to power its economy. Diversifying gas supplies will be a challenging process, but it is essential for the energy security of the Czech Republic and the stability of the wider European energy market.", "The father of a Chinese dissident is protesting his son's innocence ahead of his trial, as he believes the charges against him are politically motivated.\nThe dissident, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested earlier this year on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\" after he wrote an article critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been held in detention since then and is set to stand trial in the coming weeks.\nHowever, his father, who also cannot be named for fear of reprisals, has been speaking out in defense of his son. \"My son is innocent,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse where the trial is set to take place. \"He simply exercised his right to free speech and expressed his opinions. He is not a criminal.\"\nThe father has also accused the authorities of targeting his son for his political views. \"The charges against him are baseless,\" he said. \"They are simply a pretext to silence him and intimidate others who dare to speak out.\"\nThis is not the first time that Chinese authorities have been accused of cracking down on dissent. Human rights groups have long criticized the government's use of vague charges such as \"inciting subversion of state power\" to silence political opponents, journalists, and activists.\nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, Chinese authorities have detained and prosecuted thousands of people for politically motivated reasons, including peacefully expressing their opinions online or on social media.\nThe father's protests have garnered support from other activists and dissidents, who have called for the charges against his son to be dropped. \"We stand behind this father and his son and demand that the government respect their right to free speech,\" said one activist. \"The charges against him are a clear violation of his human rights and must be dropped.\"\nThe trial of the dissident is set to take place against a backdrop of rising tensions between China and the West. The US and other countries have been increasingly vocal in their criticism of China's human rights record, especially with regards to its treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.\nChina has bristled at this criticism, accusing Western countries of interference in its internal affairs. Chinese officials have also accused the US of \"double standards\" and hypocrisy, pointing to its own human rights abuses, such as police brutality against Black Americans and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.\nHowever, critics argue that China's human rights abuses are on a much larger scale than anything the US has ever done. The Chinese government has been accused of forced labor, genocide, and cultural erasure against the Uyghurs, as well as cracking down on democratic protests in Hong Kong and silencing dissidents within its own borders.\nAs the trial of the Chinese dissident approaches, there are fears that it could further strain China's relations with the West. The US and other countries have already imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the treatment of the Uyghurs and other human rights abuses, and there are concerns that the trial of the dissident could be another flashpoint.\nDespite this, the father of the dissident remains defiant. \"My son is innocent and I will continue to speak out for him,\" he said. \"I believe that justice will prevail in the end.\"", "Harvard economist, Professor Larry Summers, has warned that the ongoing uncertainty in Hong Kong could compromise the city's position as the world's second most competitive economy, behind Singapore.\nProfessor Summers, who served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, told a forum in Hong Kong that the uncertainty created by the recent protests and turmoil could deter investment and undermine the city's economic fundamentals.\n\"Hong Kong has been a beacon of stability and a gateway to the Chinese market for many years, and its success is built on the rule of law, a transparent and efficient system of governance, and a world-class infrastructure,\" Professor Summers said.\n\"But the recent protests and the ongoing political uncertainty raise concerns about the future of those pillars, and if investors and businesses start to lose confidence in Hong Kong as a hub of commerce, it could damage the city's long-term prospects.\"\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of protests, triggered initially by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China's mainland for trial. The protests have evolved into a broader movement calling for democratic reforms, and have seen violent clashes between protesters and police.\nThe turmoil has taken a toll on Hong Kong's economy, with the government forecasting a contraction in gross domestic product for 2019, the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.\nHowever, Hong Kong still boasts many advantages that contribute to its competitive edge, including a highly educated workforce, attractive tax regime, and strategic location as a gateway to the Chinese market.\nSingapore, which topped the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2019, also faces its own challenges, including an aging population, a tight labor market, and rising geopolitical risks.\n\"Singapore has been very successful in building a knowledge-based economy and attracting global talent, but it also faces some structural challenges that could limit its long-term growth potential,\" Professor Summers said.\n\"Both Hong Kong and Singapore are facing headwinds, and they will need to be proactive in addressing these challenges and capitalizing on their strengths if they want to remain at the forefront of the global economy.\"\nA recent report by the Asian Development Bank noted that while Hong Kong has a \"highly competitive and open economy,\" it faces challenges in \"adapting to new technologies and business models, enhancing labor productivity, and attracting and retaining talent.\"\nThe report called for Hong Kong to \"redouble its efforts to create an innovation-friendly environment, invest in education and training, and promote a more diversified economic structure.\"\nProfessor Summers echoed those recommendations, noting that \"the key to Hong Kong's success is its ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay ahead of the curve.\"\n\"If Hong Kong can maintain its commitment to the rule of law, transparency, and openness, while also investing in innovation, education, and human capital, it could continue to be a powerhouse of the global economy,\" he said.\n\"However, if the current uncertainty persists or escalates, it could undermine the city's economic stability and diminish its competitive advantage. The stakes are high, and the time to act is now.\"", "Computer Associates (CA) announced on Tuesday its plan to expand its systems management software to new platforms and strengthen ties with Microsoft and other technology companies.

These include introducing flat-rate internet pricing and hiring Robert Pittman as the head of their online service.\nAs AOL announced this new direction, they made it very clear that they intend to become a powerful and influential player in the media world. To accomplish this, AOL will be shifting its focus from being a subscription-based internet service provider to creating and distributing high-quality content across multiple platforms.\nIn order to compete with other mass media companies like Netflix and Amazon, AOL is investing heavily in its original content and multimedia capabilities. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with other major media corporations, such as NBC Universal and Twentieth Century Fox, to help them expand their reach.\nBut the most significant change that AOL has made is the introduction of flat-rate internet pricing. This move is aimed at making their service more accessible and affordable for the average consumer.\nAccording to Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AOL, they are doing away with their old pricing model because it was \"too confusing and too expensive.\" The new plan is much simpler, with just two options: a basic plan that costs $20 a month for up to 20 hours of internet usage, and a premium plan that costs $30 a month for unlimited usage.\nThis new pricing plan is a major shift for AOL, which has historically charged by the hour for its dial-up internet service. But as the world has moved towards more high-speed and always-on internet connections, AOL has had to adapt. With this new flat-rate pricing model, AOL hopes to attract a wider range of customers, including those who may have previously shied away from the service due to high and complicated pricing.\nThe final major change that AOL has made is the hiring of Robert Pittman as the head of their online service. Pittman has an impressive background in media, having previously served as the CEO of both MTV Networks and Clear Channel Communications. His expertise in both traditional and digital media will be a huge asset to AOL as they continue to navigate their new focus on becoming a mass media company.\nPittman's appointment comes at a critical time for AOL, as the company tries to expand its reach and presence in the media world. According to Armstrong, Pittman will play a key role in helping AOL to \"create and distribute the best possible content for our consumers.\" With his experience and expertise, Pittman is expected to bring a lot to the table in terms of creative leadership and strategic planning.\nOverall, the changes that AOL has made are a clear signal of the company's ambition to become a major player in the media world. By shifting their focus from subscriptions to content, and by introducing new pricing options and hiring fresh talent, the company is positioning itself for real success in the years to come.\nHowever, it is important to note that this shift will not happen overnight. AOL will need to put in a lot of hard work and invest substantial resources if they wish to truly become a mass media company. But with these changes in place, they are certainly off to a strong start. We can expect to see continued growth and innovation from AOL in the months and years to come.", "The family of Chinese dissident Wang Dan has finally found a lawyer to represent him at his upcoming trial. Initially, Wang Dan\u2019s family had struggled to find a lawyer as many lawyers in China are hesitant to take on high-profile political cases out of fear of retaliation from the Chinese government.\nWang Dan, an activist from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was arrested on July 1st after sharing a petition on social media in support of the Hong Kong democracy movement. According to Chinese officials, Wang is facing charges of \u201cattempting to subvert state power\u201d, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\nWang Dan\u2019s family had pleaded for help from human rights organizations and lawyers to represent him at his trial, but they received little response due to the Chinese government\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent and civil rights activists.\nHowever, Wang Dan\u2019s family did not give up hope and continued to search for a lawyer to represent him. Eventually, Beijing-based human rights lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan agreed to take on the case.\nLiu Xiaoyuan is a well-known human rights lawyer who has represented other political dissidents such as Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in custody in 2017. Liu Xiaoyuan has also defended Chinese activists who have protested against the Chinese government\u2019s policies in Tibet and Xinjiang.\nLiu Xiaoyuan has stated that he will do his best to defend Wang Dan, but he is also aware of the challenges he will face due to the Chinese government\u2019s strict control over the judicial system. Liu has stated that he believes Wang Dan is innocent and that his arrest is an example of the Chinese government\u2019s growing intolerance of dissent.\nWang Dan\u2019s arrest has been widely condemned by international human rights groups and politicians. The United States has called for Wang\u2019s immediate release, and the European Parliament has also expressed its concern over his detention.\nWang Dan\u2019s case is just one of many examples of China\u2019s growing crackdown on dissent and civil rights activists. Thousands of Chinese activists, lawyers, and dissidents have been arrested in recent years, as the Chinese government tries to maintain its grip on power and suppress any form of opposition.\nThe Chinese government has defended its actions, stating that it is necessary for national security and stability, but critics argue that it is a violation of basic human rights and freedom of expression.\nAs Wang Dan\u2019s trial approaches, his family and supporters are calling for his release and for the Chinese government to respect human rights and the rule of law.\nWang Dan\u2019s case is a reminder of the ongoing struggle for human rights and democracy in China. Despite the challenges and risks, activists and dissidents continue to speak out, hoping to bring about change in a country where dissent is met with repression.\nThe outcome of Wang Dan\u2019s trial remains uncertain, but his family and supporters are determined to continue fighting for his release and for the recognition of human rights in China.", "As Beijing gathers for a key meeting, Hong Kong is waiting nervously to see what the outcome will mean for its future. The gathering will set the tone for the post-colonial government of the city, and there are fears that it could be a major turning point in the ongoing struggle over Hong Kong's autonomy.\nThe meeting in Beijing is known as the \"Two Sessions\", and it is the annual gathering of China's top legislative and political advisory bodies. This year's meeting is particularly important for Hong Kong, as it comes just months after the city was rocked by widespread protests in support of greater autonomy from China.\nThe protests, which began in June 2019 and continued for months, were sparked by a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the protests continued, with demonstrators calling for universal suffrage and greater protections for civil liberties.\nThe Beijing gathering will be closely watched by both Hong Kong residents and the international community, as it is expected to lay out the Chinese government's plans for the city in the coming years. Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, is also expected to attend the meeting, and she will likely face pressure from Beijing to crack down on dissent and maintain order in the city.\nMany in Hong Kong fear that the Chinese government will use the meeting to further erode the city's autonomy and crack down on dissent. There are already signs that this is happening, with several prominent pro-democracy activists and lawmakers arrested in recent months on charges of \"subversion\" and other vague crimes.\nThe Chinese government has also been cracking down on the city's media and educational institutions, with many journalists and academics facing pressure to adhere to the Communist Party's ideology.\nProtests have returned to the streets of Hong Kong in recent weeks, with demonstrators calling for the release of those arrested in the government crackdown. The protests have been met with a heavy police presence, and there are concerns that the situation could escalate if the Beijing meeting results in further restrictions on civil liberties.\nDespite these concerns, there are also some who remain optimistic about Hong Kong's future. Some analysts believe that the Chinese government may be willing to compromise on some aspects of its policies in order to maintain stability in the city.\nThere have also been calls from Hong Kong residents for the city to focus on developing its own economy and fostering greater cooperation with other countries in the region. This could help to reduce the city's reliance on China and strengthen its position as a global financial hub.\nWhatever the outcome of the Beijing meeting, it is clear that Hong Kong is at a crossroads. The city is facing significant challenges as it seeks to maintain its autonomy and protect its civil liberties, while also navigating its relationship with the Chinese government.\nThe coming months will be crucial for Hong Kong, and it remains to be seen what the future holds. For now, residents are watching and waiting with bated breath, hoping for a positive outcome from the Beijing gathering.", "The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to expand bank activities has stirred up a wave of reactions from analysts and industry officials, who believe that the move has further intensified the push towards an overhaul of the US banking regulations.\nThe Federal Reserve voted last week to alter its rules regarding the Volcker Rule, which was implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading and making certain types of speculative investments. The Volcker Rule had long been viewed by banks as a burdensome regulation that limited their ability to generate profits.\nThe change to the Volcker Rule will now allow banks to invest in venture capital funds, broaden their trading activities, and simplify their compliance regulations. The Federal Reserve noted that the changes will allow banks to better serve their customers and strengthen the financial system.\nHowever, critics of the changes argue that the deregulation of the banking sector could lead to risky behavior and increase the likelihood of another financial crisis. They believe that the changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unravel the post-crisis regulatory framework that was established to protect consumers and prevent future economic disasters.\nBanks and industry groups, on the other hand, have lauded the changes, arguing that they will provide greater flexibility and clarity to their operations. They believe that the modifications will enable them to more effectively manage their risks and generate higher returns for their investors.\nAnalysts and experts have weighed in on the implications of the Federal Reserve's decision. Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University, stated that the alterations to the Volcker Rule could exacerbate the structural problems in the US financial system, increasing the risk of another systemic shock.\nOthers believe that the changes highlight the ongoing conflict between the need for stability and the desire for growth in the financial sector. The forthcoming changes to the regulations, including the proposed overhaul of Dodd-Frank, will continue to shape the banking landscape in the US and the world at large.\nIrrespective of the differing viewpoints, there is no denying that the changes to the Volcker Rule are part of a larger trend of deregulation and loosening of the reins on the financial industry. While the effects of this shift may not be visible immediately, it is certain that its consequences will shape the direction of the US banking sector and the economy for years to come.", "The CEO of ITT Automotive Inc, Richard Calore, made a contentious announcement at the company's annual shareholder meeting. He stated that the company is planning to pay its workers less than $10 an hour by 2000. This move is part of the company's cost-cutting measures, as it struggles to remain profitable in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe announcement was met with shock and anger from the company's employees and union representatives. Many of them expressed concern that such a low wage could jeopardize the livelihoods of ITT Automotive's workers. They argue that a lower wage could lead to a reduced quality of life for their families, and that it sets a dangerous precedent for other companies to follow.\nOne union representative was quoted as saying, \"This is unacceptable. The workers at ITT Automotive deserve fair compensation for their hard work. We will fight tooth and nail to make sure that they receive a living wage.\"\nCalore defended the decision, stating that the company could not maintain its current wage structure and remain competitive in the market. He added that the company was committed to providing competitive benefits packages to its employees, including healthcare and retirement plans.\nThe announcement comes as ITT Automotive faces stiff competition from other automotive suppliers, both domestic and foreign. The company has seen its profits decline in recent years as a result of these challenges. In response, ITT Automotive has been implementing a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at improving its bottom line.\nSome experts have expressed concern that a wage reduction could have a negative impact on the company's overall operations. They argue that a lower wage could lead to reduced morale and productivity among workers, resulting in decreased quality and consistency in the company's products.\nOthers, however, have praised ITT Automotive's decision, arguing that it is a necessary step in order to remain competitive in a global market. \"This is just the reality of the situation,\" said one industry analyst. \"If you want to succeed in this business, you have to make tough decisions and cut costs where you can.\"\nAs of now, it is unclear how ITT Automotive's workers and union representatives will respond to the company's announcement. However, the announcement has certainly generated significant controversy, and it remains to be seen how it will impact the company's operations going forward.", "Russia, being one of the world's largest producers of oil, has been experiencing some ups and downs in its oil production levels. However, recent data suggests that the country's oil output is steadily stabilizing, though an increase remains elusive.\nAccording to the Russian Energy Ministry, the country pumped an average of 10.41 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in August 2020, which is a decline from the 11.29 million bpd in the same month last year. While it is still a drop, it shows signs of stabilizing, as July's production was 10.39 million bpd.\nThe decline in oil production is attributed to the country's agreement with OPEC+ to cut production levels in order to stabilize global oil prices. Russia, together with Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries, have implemented a series of production cuts throughout the year to address the oversupply of crude oil in the market.\nDespite the decrease in oil production, Russia is still one of the leading oil producers in the world and has been sustaining its ranking year after year. In 2019, the country produced around 11.25 million bpd of oil, making it the second-largest producer after the United States.\nBut with the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc on global oil demand, Russia, like many other oil-producing countries, has had to adjust its production levels to match market demand. The production cuts, which were implemented in May, have been extended until the end of 2020, and this has contributed to the stabilization of Russia's oil output.\nHowever, the stabilization does not necessarily mean an increase in oil production. It is still unclear when Russia's oil production levels will return to pre-pandemic levels since the pandemic's impact on oil demand remains unpredictable.\nSome experts remain optimistic, hoping that the increasing demand for oil from China will provide a much-needed boost. China, which is the world's largest oil importer, has been actively importing oil from Russia, increasing its imports by a staggering 170% in the first quarter of 2020. This increase in demand could help Russia's oil industry recover from the pandemic-related slump.\nAdditionally, Russia's recent efforts to boost investment in its oil sector could also lead to higher output levels in the future. The government has been rolling out measures to attract more foreign investors to its oil industry, with the ultimate goal of increasing production levels. The country aims to double the production of oil and gas condensate by 2035, from the current levels of around 11 million bpd.\nHowever, the industry's potential for growth faces several challenges, such as the country's ageing oil fields, which require significant investments to maintain production levels. Furthermore, the country's oil infrastructure, such as pipelines and refineries, needs extensive upgrades to support higher output levels.\nAnother issue is the US sanctions that have limited foreign investment in Russia's oil industry. Recently, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of the world's largest investors, announced that it would divest from companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas in Russia. This move highlights how international sanctions continue to impact Russia's oil sector.\nIn conclusion, while Russia's oil production levels show signs of stabilizing, growth remains elusive. The country's agreement with OPEC+ to cut production levels, the COVID-19 pandemic's unpredictable impact on oil demand, and the challenges involved in increasing production pose significant hurdles for Russia's oil industry. However, with the recent efforts to attract foreign investment and the growing demand from China, there is hope for the industry's future growth.", "In a joint statement released yesterday, technology giants Netscape and Microsoft agreed that the so-called \"browser wars\" of the past few years have been \"silly\" and \"counterproductive\". The two companies, which have been locked in a bitter battle for dominance in the world of internet browsing software, expressed a desire to put their differences behind them and move forward in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration.\n\"Looking back, we realize that the browser wars were a distraction from what was really important - providing users with the best possible web experience,\" the statement read. \"We both believe that there is a lot of room for innovation and growth in this field, and that by working together we can create products that are more secure, more reliable, and more user-friendly than ever before.\"\nDespite this conciliatory tone, however, observers noted that the sparks still seemed to be flying between the two companies. Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, for instance, took the opportunity to criticize Microsoft's business practices, saying that the company's dominant market position had been gained through \"anti-competitive\" tactics.\n\"It's no secret that Microsoft has done everything in its power to squash competition in the browser market,\" Andreessen told reporters. \"They've abused their dominant position to force users to use their software, and they've stolen our ideas and incorporated them into their own products without permission.\"\nMicrosoft, for its part, was quick to deny these accusations. \"We've always competed fairly and honestly in the browser market,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We believe in offering users a choice, and we've worked hard to innovate and provide the best possible products. We're glad that Netscape recognizes the importance of competition, and we look forward to continuing to compete with them and other players in this space.\"\nDespite the lingering tensions between the two companies, experts say that the agreement to work together is a positive sign for the technology industry as a whole. \"The browser wars have been one of the most bitter and prolonged battles in the history of the tech industry,\" said analyst Peter Williams. \"By coming together and acknowledging the silliness of the whole thing, Netscape and Microsoft are setting an example for other companies to follow. They're showing that even bitter rivals can find common ground and work together for the greater good.\"\nIndeed, the joint statement released by the two companies outlined a number of initiatives they plan to undertake together in the coming months. These include:\n- Collaborating on new web standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability between their respective browsers.\n- Sharing security information and best practices to help protect users from online threats.\n- Exploring new ways to make web browsing faster, more efficient, and more intuitive.\n- Partnering on research and development efforts related to the future of the internet and the role of browsers in that future.\n\"By working together, we believe that we can create products that are better and more innovative than either of us could create alone,\" the statement read. \"We both recognize the importance of the internet and the role that browsers play in shaping its future. We're excited to see what we can achieve by combining our strengths and expertise.\"\nReaction to the agreement has been mostly positive, with many technology industry experts praising the companies for putting aside their differences and working together. \"This is a win-win for both companies and for the industry as a whole,\" said tech analyst John Smith. \"It shows that even companies that have been bitter rivals for years can find common ground and work together for the good of their users.\"\nOthers, however, remain skeptical about the deal. \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" said software developer Sarah Lee. \"These companies have been fighting tooth and nail for so long, it's hard to imagine them suddenly becoming best friends. There's still a lot of bad blood between them, and I'm not sure that's going to go away overnight.\"\nIt remains to be seen how successful the Netscape-Microsoft partnership will be in the long run. But regardless of the outcome, it's clear that the agreement marks a significant shift in the tech industry - a shift away from bitter rivalries and towards a more collaborative, cooperative future. Whether or not the sparks continue to fly between these two giants, it seems likely that we'll see more partnerships and alliances emerge in the years to come. In a world of rapidly-changing technology and ever-increasing competition, the only constant may be the need to work together in order to stay ahead.", "Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), one of the largest utilities companies in France, has announced higher profits due to strong growth across its key segments. The company has also revealed plans to reorganise its troubled construction business, which has been a source of concern for investors for several quarters.\nAccording to the financial reports released by CGE, the company recorded a net profit of \u20ac585 million in the first quarter of 2021, up by 10% compared to the same period last year. This result was driven by improved performance across the group's core businesses, including water, waste management, and energy.\nIn particular, CGE's water division saw a significant uptick in profits, increasing by 12% to \u20ac2.3 billion, due to strong demand for the company's services amid rising awareness around water scarcity and sustainability. Similarly, the waste management unit saw a 7% increase in profits to \u20ac690 million, underpinned by increased investments in recycling and waste-to-energy projects.\nHowever, the company's construction business, which represents a small but critical part of CGE's portfolio, continued to underperform, recording a net loss of \u20ac40 million in the first quarter. This figure follows a string of disappointing results for the division, which has struggled with low margins, cost overruns, and project delays.\nTo address these challenges, CGE has announced plans to restructure its construction business, including the creation of a new subsidiary that will focus on high-margin construction projects, such as airports, railways, and power plants.\n\"We recognise that the construction industry is going through a difficult phase, with intense competition and margin pressures,\" said Jean-Pierre Fournier, chairman of CGE. \"To address these challenges, we are taking steps to reorganise our construction business, streamline our operations, and focus on projects that offer higher profitability and better risk profiles.\"\nFournier added that the company was confident in its ability to turn the construction division around, citing a strong backlog of projects and a skilled workforce as key advantages.\nInvestors welcomed the news of CGE's strong profits and plans to restructure its construction business, with shares in the company rising by 3% in early trading on Tuesday. The company's stock has been under pressure in recent months due to concerns over the weak construction business, as well as uncertainty around the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the utilities sector.\nHowever, analysts caution that CGE still faces a challenging operating environment, with mounting regulatory pressures, rising raw material costs, and a rapidly changing competitive landscape.\n\"The utilities industry is undergoing significant transformation, driven by the shift towards renewable energy, the digitisation of infrastructure, and increasing regulatory scrutiny,\" said Yves No\u00ebl, an analyst at investment bank BNP Paribas. \"CGE will need to remain agile, innovative, and adaptable to capitalise on opportunities and mitigate risks in this dynamic environment.\"\nDespite these challenges, CGE remains one of the strongest players in the utilities sector, with a sizable and diversified business model, a track record of innovation and investment, and a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The company operates across 70 countries and employs more than 300,000 people worldwide.", "In a major move that could have significant implications for businesses and investors, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has announced he is considering cutting tax credits on dividends as part of his upcoming budget speech.\nThe tax credits on dividends, which are paid to shareholders in companies, currently stand at 10%. However, under the Chancellor\u2019s proposal, that figure could be reduced or even eliminated altogether. The move is part of a wider effort to overhaul the UK\u2019s tax system and raise revenue for public services.\nSpeaking ahead of his budget speech, Mr Clarke said that he believes the tax credit system is \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d He argued that the current system disproportionately benefits wealthier investors who are able to take advantage of tax loopholes and avoid paying their fair share.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about building an economy that works for everyone, we need to make sure that our tax system is fair and equitable,\u201d Mr Clarke said. \u201cAt present, the tax credits on dividends are an outdated and unfair system that benefits the wealthiest in our society at the expense of everyone else. By reforming the system, we can raise vital revenue and ensure that everyone pays their fair share.\u201d\nThe move has been welcomed by some experts, who argue that the current system is long overdue for reform. They point out that many wealthy investors use tax credits on dividends to avoid paying income tax, which places a disproportionate burden on middle and low-income earners.\n\u201cFor too long, the tax system has been rigged in favor of the wealthiest in our society,\u201d said John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. \u201cBy cutting tax credits on dividends, we can ensure that everyone pays their fair share and that public services are adequately funded.\u201d\nHowever, the proposal has also been met with opposition from some quarters. Business leaders have warned that the move could discourage investment in UK companies and harm the economy. They argue that reducing tax credits on dividends could lead to a decrease in investment, which could in turn have negative consequences for the wider business community.\n\u201cInvestment is the lifeblood of the economy,\u201d said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry. \u201cBy cutting tax credits on dividends, the Chancellor risks discouraging investment in UK companies and undermining our competitiveness. We urge him to reconsider this move and instead focus on creating a tax system that rewards investment and promotes economic growth.\u201d\nThe Chancellor\u2019s budget speech is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen whether he will proceed with his proposal to cut tax credits on dividends, or if he will take the concerns of businesses and investors into account and pursue a different approach. Either way, the proposals are likely to have a significant impact on the UK economy and the wider business community.", "Market research firms are divided in their predictions for the demand of personal computers in the third quarter of the year. While some believe in a half-empty scenario, others see a half-full outcome.\nAccording to a report by Gartner, personal computer shipments will decline by 2.1 percent in the third quarter of 2021, reaching 71.6 million units. However, another research firm, IDC, predicts a growth of 14.2 percent in the same period, with 87.8 million units shipped.\nThe contrast between these two predictions stems from different factors that could impact the personal computer market in the coming months. One of the main reasons for Gartner's pessimistic outlook is the global chip shortage, which has affected the production and shipment of various electronic devices, including personal computers. This issue has led to higher prices and longer waiting times for customers.\nMoreover, Gartner highlights the shift in consumer preferences towards tablets and smartphones, which offer better mobility and functionality for everyday tasks compared to traditional desktop and laptop computers.\nOn the other hand, IDC points out the increase in demand for personal computers from remote workers and students who need reliable devices for online learning and telecommuting. The pandemic has forced many individuals and organizations to adapt to new ways of working and studying, which has boosted the sales of computers, particularly those with advanced features such as touchscreens and convertibles.\nAccording to research by Statista, the global market for personal computers was valued at over 300 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, with an estimated growth rate of 4.5 percent for 2021. This indicates the importance of personal computers as essential tools for various industries and segments of society.\nDespite the contrasting views on personal computer demand in the third quarter, it is clear that the market is undergoing significant changes influenced by technological advancements, economic factors, and social trends.\nFor instance, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is transforming the way personal computers are used for data analysis, automation, and decision-making. This has implications for businesses, government agencies, and academic researchers looking for innovative ways to meet the demands of a digital economy.\nMoreover, the increasing focus on cybersecurity and privacy concerns is driving the demand for personal computers with enhanced features such as biometric authentication, data encryption, and anti-virus software. This represents an opportunity for computer manufacturers to differentiate their products in a crowded market and meet the evolving needs of customers.\nAs the personal computer market evolves, it is important for market research firms to keep abreast of the latest trends, innovations, and challenges. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that draws on insights from technology, economics, sociology, psychology, and other fields.\nMarket research firms need to leverage data analytics tools and methodologies to collect, analyze, and interpret data from multiple sources, including surveys, polls, social media, search engines, and customer feedback. This will enable them to build accurate and reliable forecasts that inform strategic decision-making for businesses, investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, the disagreement between market research firms on third-quarter personal computer demand reflects the complexity and dynamism of the market. The trends and drivers shaping personal computer sales are multifaceted and interdependent, requiring a holistic understanding and analysis.\nRather than taking a half-full or half-empty approach, market research firms should adopt a nuanced and evidence-based perspective that considers the long-term prospects, opportunities, and risks of the personal computer market. This will enable them to provide valuable insights and advice that help businesses and other stakeholders navigate the changing landscape of technology and society.", "Toronto, Canada - The Toronto stock market closed at a record high for the 51st time in 1996 on Tuesday, amid a rally in interest-sensitive issues and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada.\nThe benchmark S&P/TSX composite index finished the day at 14,363.11, up 67.69 points from the previous day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose by 2.4 percent, driven by the strong performance of Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco.\nThe jump in global equity markets was triggered by a rally in interest-sensitive stocks as investors bet on a cut in interest rates by the Bank of Canada, which is expected to support economic growth. The rally was also fueled by strong earnings reports from some of the biggest banks in Canada.\nBank of Montreal reported a third-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, beating market expectations, while Bank of Nova Scotia reported a third-quarter profit of $2.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion in the previous year.\n\"The strength of the banks' earnings is an indication that the Canadian economy is performing well and it is likely that the Bank of Canada will follow the US Federal Reserve and cut interest rates,\" said David Redford, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities.\nThe rally in interest-sensitive issues was led by the gold and energy sectors, with shares of Barrick Gold Corp, Goldcorp Inc, and Suncor Energy Inc rising by 2.1 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.8 percent respectively.\nThe performance of the Toronto stock market was also driven by a string of positive economic reports, including better-than-expected employment data and strong retail sales figures. Canada's unemployment rate fell to 7 percent in July from 7.1 percent in the previous month, while retail sales rose by 0.7 percent in June, beating expectations.\n\"The Canadian economy is showing signs of strength, with improvements in employment and retail sales, and this is reflected in the performance of the stock market,\" said Redford.\nThe positive sentiment also spilled over into the Canadian dollar, which climbed to a one-month high against the US dollar on Tuesday. The loonie rose by 0.5 cents to close at 77.90 cents US.", "Shanghai's iconic Hongkong & Shanghai Bank (HSBC) building, located on the famous Bund promenade, has been put up for rent after being vacant for over a decade. According to sources, the government has decided to lease the historic property to an unnamed bank, which has expressed interest in occupying the space.\nBuilt in the neo-classical style, the HSBC building was completed in 1923 and served as the bank's headquarters for over six decades. The building was the first high-rise on the Bund and was designed to be a symbol of modernity and prosperity in China.\nThe building's interior features stunning marble floors, ornate stained glass windows, and an impressive bank vault in the basement. The exterior boasts columns and pediments inspired by ancient Greek architecture, while the iconic clock tower rises above the city skyline.\nFor many years, the HSBC building was a landmark in Shanghai, a symbol of the city's rise as an international financial center. But the bank moved its headquarters to Hong Kong in 1986, and the building was left vacant for years.\nIn 2001, the Shanghai government announced plans to turn the HSBC building into a museum, showcasing the city's history as a financial center. However, these plans were put on hold due to the high costs of renovation and maintenance.\nNow, with the city's real estate market booming, the government has decided to lease the property to a bank that will not only pay rent but also take on the costs of the building's upkeep.\nThe unnamed bank has reportedly been selected after a rigorous bidding process, with several banks showing interest in occupying the space. According to sources, the bank has agreed to pay a record-high rent for the building, as well as take on the costs of renovation and maintenance.\nThe move has been welcomed by many in the city, who see it as a positive step towards the revitalization of the Bund. The HSBC building is one of the most iconic structures on the promenade, and its occupancy by a bank is seen as a fitting tribute to its history.\nThe move is also seen as a sign of the city's growing importance as a global financial center. Shanghai is home to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is the headquarters of several major Chinese banks. The leasing of the HSBC building to a bank is seen as a further indication of the city's ambitions to become a leading financial center in Asia.\nHowever, some have raised concerns about the impact of the move on the Bund's heritage. The Bund is home to many historic buildings, and there are fears that the leasing of the HSBC building to a modern bank could detract from the area's historical charm.\nNevertheless, the government has assured the public that the building's historic features will be preserved, and the bank will be required to maintain the building's original appearance.\nThe leasing of the HSBC building to an unnamed bank is set to inject new life into one of Shanghai's most iconic landmarks. The move is seen as a positive step towards the revitalization of the Bund, as well as a sign of the city's growing importance as a global financial center.", "Republic Industries, the Florida-based conglomerate, has recently defended its plans to acquire ADT, the security company, amidst reports suggesting that the potential deal has been canceled.\nThe proposed acquisition has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. Reports emerged earlier this month that suggested ADT was either seeking alternative acquisition offers or considering not going through with any sale at all.\nHowever, Republic Industries remains steadfast in its intention to purchase ADT for around $7 billion. The conglomerate has released a statement defending its stance and reiterating the benefits that the acquisition would bring to both companies.\n\"Republic Industries firmly believes that acquiring ADT would create a stronger, more versatile business that is ideally positioned for long-term success,\" the statement reads. \"We have had productive discussions with ADT's management team and we remain committed to pursuing this acquisition.\"\nThe statement also highlighted the strategic advantages that the acquisition could offer. By combining ADT's expertise in home security with Republic's expertise across a wide range of industries, the new company would be well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for internet-connected security systems.\nHowever, some industry analysts have expressed concerns about the potential acquisition. They point to ADT's recent financial struggles, with the company's stock price having fallen significantly over the past year. Some fear that the acquisition could be a risky move for Republic Industries, particularly given the uncertainty in the current economic climate.\nDespite these concerns, Republic Industries appears to be undeterred. The company's CEO, Marc Lefar, recently confirmed in an interview that the acquisition is still on the table. He also emphasized the importance of ADT's brand and its customer base, suggesting that these factors would be key drivers of growth for the new company.\nAs the acquisition saga continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Republic Industries will be successful in its bid to purchase ADT. However, the conglomerate's decision to stick to its guns suggests that it is confident in the potential of the deal \u2013 and that it is willing to weather the current uncertainties in order to achieve its strategic goals.", "A new high-society magazine called \"The Chinese\" is set to rival popular publications like Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair in the ethnic Chinese communities worldwide.

The new company, which will be called Cable & Wireless Connect, will combine Cable & Wireless' existing fibre-optic network with Virgin Media's cable network to create a new infrastructure that will be capable of supporting even higher internet speeds and greater reliability.\nBT has long been the dominant player in the UK telecoms market, controlling much of the country's infrastructure and providing services to millions of customers. However, the company has come under increasing pressure in recent years from smaller, more agile players, who have challenged its position in the market.\nCable & Wireless has been one of these challengers, building a strong presence in the UK market by offering high-quality internet services to businesses and consumers alike. With the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect, the company is now seeking to take on BT on an even bigger scale, providing a new network that will offer faster speeds, greater reliability, and more choice to customers.\nThe new company will be led by Cable & Wireless CEO Phil Dance, who said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect was an \"exciting development\" for the company, and would help it to better serve the needs of its customers. \"By combining our existing fibre-optic network with Virgin Media's cable network, we will be able to offer a range of new services and capabilities that simply aren't available from our competitors,\" he said.\nSome analysts have said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect could have significant implications for the UK telecoms market, and could mark the beginning of a new era of competition in the industry. \"This is a big move for Cable & Wireless, and it's one that could help to challenge BT's dominance in the market,\" said Peter Mandelson, a telecoms analyst with consultants Ovum.\n\"By creating a new network that can offer higher speeds and greater reliability, Cable & Wireless Connect could really make a dent in BT's market share, and even steal customers away from the company.\"\nHowever, others have said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect will not be enough to challenge BT's dominance in the UK market, and that the company will need to do more if it really wants to take on the telecoms giant. \"While Cable & Wireless Connect is certainly a step in the right direction, it's not going to be easy to take on BT,\" said John Delaney, a telecoms analyst with research firm IDC.\n\"BT has a huge amount of infrastructure and experience in the market, and it's going to take more than a new network to truly compete with the company.\"\nDespite these challenges, Cable & Wireless is confident that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect will be a major success, and that it will help to significantly grow the company's market share in the UK. \"We believe that there is huge demand for high-quality, reliable internet services in the UK, and that Cable & Wireless Connect is perfectly positioned to meet that demand,\" said Phil Dance.\n\"We have a talented team of engineers and technicians who are working hard to build a network that will offer a new level of speed and reliability to our customers, and we're confident that we can make a real difference in the UK telecoms market.\"\nWith the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect, the UK telecoms market is set for a new era of competition, as Cable & Wireless seeks to take on BT and other major players in the industry. Whether the company will be able to truly challenge BT's dominance remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the battle for control of the UK telecoms market is heating up, and Cable & Wireless is well-positioned to play a major role in that battle.", "A recent survey revealed a significant increase in internet usage worldwide, but online services are struggling to add new customers. The study, conducted by the Pew Research Center, showed that 81% of adults in the United States use the internet, with similar figures seen in other advanced economies.\nThe study noted that the increase in internet usage was driven by the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices. Despite this, online businesses are struggling to convert this increased usage into revenue growth.\nThe study found that the biggest challenge facing online businesses was attracting new users. Many respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their current online services and saw no need to switch to new providers.\n\"Competition is fierce in the online space,\" said John Smith, a marketing analyst at the Pew Research Center.\u00a0\"Online businesses need to constantly innovate and offer unique products or services that can set them apart from their competitors.\"\nAnother factor contributing to the challenge of attracting new customers is the high level of trust that users have in their current providers. This trust leads users to be hesitant to switch to new providers, even if they offer better pricing or services.\nThe study also revealed that online businesses were struggling to retain their existing customers. Many users reported feeling dissatisfied with the level of customer service they received from their online service providers. Businesses need to prioritize customer service and ensure that their users feel valued and supported.\nDespite these challenges, online businesses remain optimistic about the future. Many are investing heavily in new technologies and products that they believe will help them attract and retain customers. They are also looking to expand into new markets and offer a broader range of services to their users.\n\"Online businesses have come a long way in the past decade,\" said Smith. \"But they need to continue to evolve and innovate if they want to stay competitive and grow their user base.\"\nIn conclusion, the survey highlights the need for online businesses to prioritize customer satisfaction and differentiate themselves from their competitors. Increasing internet usage presents an opportunity for online services to grow their customer base, but they need to understand their users' needs and offer unique products and services that demonstrate their value.", "BT Beats Analyst Forecasts with Strong Profits and Growth Despite Competition\nBT Group, the UK's largest telecoms operator, has reported better-than-expected profits and growth, despite facing stiff competition in the industry. The company, which is in the midst of a major transformation programme, revealed a 7% increase in revenue in its latest financial results.\nThe telecoms giant recorded a pre-tax profit of \u00a32.6bn ($3.4bn) for the financial year ending March 31, beating analysts' forecasts. This represented a 12% increase in profits compared to the previous year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 2%.\nBT's strong performance was driven by growth in its consumer division, which includes BT TV and EE mobile, as well as its Openreach infrastructure unit. The company saw significant growth in fibre broadband, with over half a million customers signing up over the past year.\nBT's CEO, Philip Jansen, said the company had demonstrated \"resilience\" in the face of tough market conditions. \"It was an extraordinary year, with Covid-19 impacting every aspect of our business,\" he said. \"Despite these challenges, our colleagues have worked tirelessly to keep the nation connected.\"\nJansen said that the company's investment in new technologies, such as 5G and full fibre, would help to secure its long-term future. \"We have accelerated our plans to roll out full fibre across the UK, and we are investing in 5G to bring the latest mobile technology to our customers,\" he said.\nHowever, BT's strong performance was overshadowed by concerns about its ability to continue growing, as it faces increased competition from rivals such as Virgin Media and Sky. The company's share price has dropped by more than a third over the past year, as investors fret over declining revenues and margins.\nAnalysts have also raised concerns about BT's pension deficit, which stood at \u00a37.9bn at the end of March. The company has pledged to make \u00a33bn in cash contributions to the pension fund over the next three years, but some experts have questioned whether this will be enough to meet its obligations.\nNevertheless, some analysts were upbeat about BT's prospects. Jefferies analyst, Jerry Dellis, said the company had shown \"early signs of being able to deliver on its transformation plan\".\n\"BT's consumer business had a good year, with a solid performance from EE mobile and better-than-expected growth in BT TV,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, Openreach is benefiting from the roll-out of fibre, which is helping to drive revenue growth.\"\nBT's strong performance comes amid a rapidly changing landscape in the telecoms industry. The UK government is urging telecoms operators to invest in full fibre, with the aim of achieving universal coverage by 2033. Meanwhile, there are increasing calls for greater competition in the sector, with some experts calling for the break-up of BT's Openreach division.\nIn response to these challenges, Jansen said the company was committed to investing in new technologies and making its operations more efficient. \"We are transforming the way we work, using data and technology to improve our services and reduce costs,\" he said.\nBT's results were also buoyed by strong growth in its international business, particularly in Asia and Africa. The company's global services division recorded a 5% increase in revenue, driven by demand for cyber security and cloud services.\nDespite the challenges facing the telecoms industry, BT's performance shows that there are still opportunities for growth and profitability. Whether the company can continue to compete effectively in an increasingly crowded market remains to be seen, but for now, it appears to be on a solid footing.", "The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) announced today that its pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2021 rose significantly compared to last year, but fell short of analysts' predictions.\nThe UK-based bank reported \u00a3946m pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year, up from \u00a3288m during the same period in 2020. However, this figure was still lower than the expected pre-tax profit of \u00a3968m, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe bank credited its higher profits to a number of factors, including a boost in mortgage lending as the housing market in the UK continues to perform strongly. In addition, RBS said fewer customers were defaulting on loan repayments, which helped to increase its net interest margin.\nHowever, the bank also highlighted the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, with uncertainty still prevailing in the global economy.\n\"Our results this quarter demonstrate the resilience of our business in the face of ongoing challenges,\" said RBS CEO Alison Rose in a statement. \"While we are encouraged by the progress we have made, we remain mindful of the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\"\nRBS also reported a significant increase in its capital position, with its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio rising to 18.2%, up from 16.2% in the previous quarter. This ratio is a key measure of a bank's financial strength and ability to absorb losses.\nDespite the higher profits and improved capital position, RBS's share price fell in early trading on Friday, indicating that investors were disappointed with the bank's results. The share price was down around 4% when markets opened.\nAnalysts had expected RBS to outperform its rivals in the first quarter, given its strong presence in the UK market and the recent recovery of the stock market. However, the results were seen as a mixed bag, with some positives and some disappointments.\n\"The bottom line is that RBS's results are not as good as they could have been, but they are still quite good in the current environment,\" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\nHunter said that RBS's performance was likely to be closely monitored by investors in the coming months as the bank undergoes a major restructuring plan, which involves reducing its staff and closing hundreds of branches across the UK.\n\"RBS is still in the middle of a turnaround plan, which is going to take time to fully play out,\" he said. \"Investors will want to see more progress in the next few quarters before they make any major decisions about the bank's future.\"", "Norwegian engineering company Kvaerner ASA announced that it is planning to increase its portfolio in the Asia Pacific region, which it believes will be a significant growth area in the coming years. The company, which specializes in the design, engineering, and construction of oil platforms and related structures, said it sees strong demand for its services in the region amidst a growing demand for oil and gas.\nKvaerner has been focusing on the Asia Pacific market for several years now, and it has secured several key contracts in the region. The company is currently working on several major projects in the region, including the Johan Sverdrup platform in Norway, which is set to be one of the largest oil platforms in the world.\nThe company recently signed a contract with Japan's Yinson to provide the engineering and procurement services for a new floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel that will be installed in the Marlim oil field in Brazil. The vessel will be built in Singapore, and the work will be handled by Kvaerner's office in Malaysia.\n\"We are very excited about the opportunities in the Asia Pacific region and are actively looking for new projects to add to our portfolio,\" said Kvaerner's CEO, Karl-Petter L\u00f8ken. \"The region is a key growth area for the oil and gas industry, and we believe that we can play a key role in helping our clients to meet their production goals.\"\nKvaerner's move to expand its portfolio in the Asia Pacific region comes as the company is already experiencing strong growth in other markets.

The platform is set to be one of the largest in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and it will be operated by Equinor.\nKvaerner has a long history of working in the oil and gas industry, with more than 40 years of experience in the field. The company has a reputation for delivering high-quality projects on time and on budget, and it has a strong focus on innovation and sustainability.\n\"We are confident that we have the expertise, experience, and technology to deliver world-class projects in the Asia Pacific region,\" said L\u00f8ken. \"We look forward to working with our clients to help them achieve their goals and to help them navigate the challenges of the industry.\"", "The Director-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Tim Davie, has called for an increase in the television licence fee. In a speech made on Wednesday, Davie argued that the current fee of \u00a3157.50 per household per year was necessary to maintain the quality of BBC programming and expand its services.\nDavie's call comes amid increasing pressure on the BBC's finances. The corporation has faced criticism for its management of funds, with allegations of excessive executive pay and wasteful spending on programming. However, Davie argued that the BBC's role as a public service broadcaster required it to maintain high standards and provide a broad range of content for its viewers.\nIn his speech, Davie said, \"The BBC is facing significant financial challenges, but we cannot compromise on the quality of our programming or the range of services we offer. We need to invest in new technology and content to stay competitive in an increasingly digital world. This requires an increase in the licence fee to ensure that we can continue to deliver valued and trusted services to all our viewers.\"\nDavie's proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some commentators have praised his willingness to confront the financial challenges facing the BBC, while others have criticized his call for an increase in the licence fee. The fee is mandatory for all households in the UK that own a television set, and failure to pay can result in fines or even imprisonment.\nOpponents of the licence fee argue that it is an outdated system that unfairly burdens households with an unnecessary expense. They point to the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime as evidence that viewers are no longer reliant on the BBC's programming. Proponents of the licence fee, however, argue that it provides a stable source of funding for the BBC and ensures that it remains independent of commercial interests.\nThe government has not yet responded to Davie's proposal. The licence fee is set by the government, and any change would require legislation. The last increase in the fee came in 2017, when it was raised from \u00a3147 to \u00a3150.50.\nDespite the controversy surrounding the licence fee, the BBC remains a beloved institution in the UK. Its programming reaches millions of viewers every day, and its news coverage is considered to be among the most reliable in the world. Davie's call for an increase in the licence fee is just the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the BBC's role in British society and its future funding.", "Data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) indicates that the growth of personal bank deposits in the country has slowed over the past few months. While this may seem like a positive development, analysts warn that it still poses a significant inflation threat.\nAccording to the PBOC, personal bank deposits grew by 7.3% in August, a significant drop from the 8.5% growth seen in July. This trend has continued over the past few months, with the growth rate falling steadily since May.\nOn the surface, this slowing growth may seem like a good thing, as it indicates that Chinese citizens are consuming more and saving less. However, analysts warn that it could actually be a sign of inflationary pressures building in the economy.\nInflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds the supply, driving prices higher. As consumers have more money to spend, they are willing to pay more for goods and services, putting upward pressure on prices. If personal bank deposits are growing at a slower rate, it could be a sign that consumers are spending more, which could lead to inflation down the road.\nThis is a significant concern for the Chinese government, which has been struggling to contain inflationary pressures in recent years. Inflation in China has been stubbornly high, averaging around 2.5% in recent years, despite efforts by the government to bring it under control.\nOne of the main drivers of inflation in China has been its massive housing market, which has experienced a significant boom over the past decade. However, there are concerns that this market may be overheated, and the government has been implementing policies to slow its growth.\nDespite these efforts, analysts believe that inflation remains a significant threat to the Chinese economy, and the slowing growth of personal bank deposits is a worrying sign. While it may be a positive development in the short term, it could indicate deeper underlying problems in the Chinese economy that could lead to inflation down the road.\nOne potential solution to this problem would be for the government to implement measures that encourage Chinese citizens to save more. This could be done through policies such as offering tax incentives for saving or increasing interest rates on savings accounts. By incentivizing savings, the government could help to reduce the amount of money that is flowing into the economy, which would help to control inflation down the road.\nOverall, the slowing growth of personal bank deposits in China is a worrying sign for the Chinese economy. While it may seem like a positive development in the short term, it could indicate deeper underlying problems that could lead to inflation down the road. As such, it is important for the government to take proactive measures to encourage saving and reduce inflationary pressures in the economy.", "Wolseley Plc, the UK's leading distributor of heating, plumbing, and building materials, is set to announce a slight drop in profits for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021. However, it is expected to increase its dividend payout due to strong cash flow and improved efficiency.\nAccording to analysts, the company's profits are likely to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted the construction industry. The company had also incurred significant one-off costs due to restructuring, which impacted its earnings.\nDespite the decline in profits, the company's revenue has remained stable due to its diversified product portfolio and strong market position. The company's recent acquisition of Merritt Plastics, a US-based supplier of plastic pipes, is expected to further strengthen its position in the North American market.\nCommenting on the results, CEO Adrian Barden said, \"We are pleased with our performance in a challenging year. We have made significant progress in simplifying our business and improving efficiency, which has helped us to weather the impact of the pandemic. We remain committed to our long-term strategy of expanding our presence in key markets and providing value to our customers.\"\nInvestors are likely to be pleased with the company's decision to increase its dividend payout, which reflects its confidence in its ability to generate cash and maintain a strong balance sheet. The company has a track record of paying consistent dividends, and the increased payout is expected to be well-received by shareholders.\nWolseley Plc is set to release its full-year results on September 14, 2021. The company's shares have been trading steadily in recent weeks, and investors will be watching closely for any updates on its growth plans and strategic initiatives.", "Barclays' investment banking arm, Barclays Investment Bank, has announced a major restructuring of its Global Markets division in a bid to compete with its rivals. The move comes in the wake of a string of disappointing financial results, with Barclays' investment banking division having been hit hard by tougher regulations, lower profits, and increased competition.\nThe restructuring is designed to streamline the Global Markets division, which is responsible for the sale and trading of financial instruments such as bonds and currencies. The division will be reorganized into three main areas: Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), Equities, and Prime Services.\nThe FICC division, which has been struggling in recent years due to lower trading volumes and increased competition from electronic trading platforms, will be split into two separate groups: Rates and Credit, and Macro. The Equities division, which has been performing better than the FICC division, will be expanded to include cash equities, equity derivatives, and structured products. The Prime Services division, which provides clearing and settlement services to hedge funds and other institutional clients, will remain unchanged.\nAccording to a statement issued by Barclays Investment Bank, the restructuring will \"position the firm for improved growth and profitability, while also enabling us to better serve our clients.\" The statement also noted that the new structure will allow the division to \"capitalize on emerging trends in the global financial markets.\"\nThe restructuring is part of a broader effort by Barclays Investment Bank to cut costs and increase profits. The division has been struggling to keep up with its rivals, particularly in the face of increased competition from smaller, more nimble firms. Barclays has also been hampered by regulatory challenges, as regulators have cracked down on risk-taking and proprietary trading.\nThe move comes as other investment banks have been making similar changes in response to the changing market environment. Goldman Sachs recently announced that it was merging its bond trading and interest rate swap trading operations, while JP Morgan has been cutting costs and streamlining its operations in an effort to boost profits.\nThe restructuring is also likely to lead to job losses, as the division seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Barclays Investment Bank has not provided specific numbers, it is expected that several hundred jobs will be lost as a result of the restructuring.\nWhile the move is seen as a necessary step for Barclays Investment Bank to improve its performance and remain competitive, it is also likely to face criticism from some quarters. Unions and employee groups are likely to argue that the job losses are unnecessary, and that the bank should be doing more to protect its workers.\nOverall, the restructuring of the Global Markets division is a significant move for Barclays Investment Bank, as it seeks to navigate the rapidly changing financial markets. The move is likely to help the division to compete more effectively with its rivals, but it will also come at a cost, with job losses and other changes causing disruption for employees and customers alike.", "In recent weeks, Chinese soybean buyers have been defaulting on and cancelling contracts as international prices for the crop have fallen sharply. The move is causing concern among farmers, traders, and analysts as it raises fears of oversupply and further price declines.\nAccording to reports, Chinese buyers have been unable to take delivery of soybean cargoes due to a lack of storage space, slow customs clearance, and weaker domestic demand. As a result, they have either defaulted on their contracts or cancelled them altogether, causing widespread market disruption.\nThe situation has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, which have led to reduced Chinese imports of US soybeans and increased purchases from other countries like Brazil and Argentina. This has put pressure on global soybean prices, which have fallen 15% over the past two months.\nThe fall in prices has been particularly hard on US farmers, who have seen demand from China decline sharply. Many farmers had planted soybeans with the expectation of selling to China, but that hope has been dashed as the trade war has dragged on.\nThe situation is also causing concern among traders and analysts, who fear that oversupply will further depress prices and hurt farmers. Currently, there are large quantities of unsold soybeans sitting in storage facilities across the world, and the cancellation of Chinese contracts will only add to this surplus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real mess right now,\u201d said Jim Sutter, CEO of the US Soybean Export Council. \u201cThe market needs to find a way to absorb all this supply, and that\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\nThe situation has led some to call for government intervention to help farmers and stabilize prices. However, others argue that market forces should be allowed to play out, and that farmers should adapt to the changing realities of the global market.\n\u201cFarmers need to be thinking more strategically and diversifying their crops,\u201d said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on one country or one crop anymore.\u201d\nDespite the challenges, some farmers and traders remain optimistic that the market will eventually rebound. They point to the long-term demand for soybeans in China, which is expected to grow as the country\u2019s middle class expands and shifts to a more protein-rich diet.\n\u201cThe Chinese market is too big to ignore,\u201d said Grant Kimberley, director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before things turn around.\u201d\nIn the meantime, however, the situation remains uncertain. Chinese buyers are being cautious amid the trade tensions, and farmers are feeling the pinch as prices continue to fall. Ultimately, the fate of the soybean market will depend on how quickly the trade tensions between China and the US are resolved, and how quickly global demand for soybeans rebounds.\nUntil then, farmers and traders will be watching closely, hoping that the market will stabilize and that they can continue to supply the world\u2019s growing demand for this versatile and important crop.", "As U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed his focus on Asian foreign policy, experts cautioned against any potential conflict over Taiwan. Recent tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, with China claiming the island as part of its territory, while Taiwan maintains its independence.\nThis renewed focus on Asia comes as the U.S. seeks to maintain its role as a global leader and counteract China's increasing power in the region. However, experts warn that any conflict involving Taiwan could lead to a major power struggle between the U.S. and China, with potentially catastrophic consequences for all involved.\n\"There is a tendency for the U.S. to view Taiwan as an ally in a larger conflict with China, but this is a dangerous mindset,\" says Dr. John Smith, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Taiwan is a highly sensitive issue for China, and any perceived encroachment by the U.S. could easily escalate into a major conflict.\"\nPresident Clinton's renewed focus on Asia has largely been driven by economic interests and concerns over China's growing influence in the region. The U.S. is seeking to establish stronger trade ties with countries in the region, and has also been increasing its military presence there.\nHowever, experts caution that this could also provoke China into taking more aggressive actions, especially in regards to Taiwan. China has long maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory, and has never ruled out the use of military force to reclaim the island.\n\"The issue of Taiwan is not simply an economic or political matter, but is deeply rooted in China's national identity and territorial integrity,\" says Dr. Wei Zhang, a China expert at Harvard University. \"Any perceived threat to this could lead to a strong response from the Chinese government.\"\nMany experts also point out that any conflict over Taiwan would have major economic consequences for both the U.S. and China. Taiwan is a major player in the global technology industry, with many of the world's largest tech companies relying on Taiwanese suppliers.\nA conflict over Taiwan could disrupt global supply chains and cause significant economic damage. It could also lead to a major military conflict, with devastating consequences for all involved.\nGiven these risks, experts are urging President Clinton to tread carefully when it comes to Taiwan. They argue that the U.S. should focus on diplomacy and finding peaceful solutions to the issue, rather than escalating tensions with China.\n\"The U.S. needs to be very careful when it comes to Taiwan,\" says Dr. Smith. \"We need to be aware of China's concerns and try to find ways to address them without escalating the situation.\"\nThere are some signs that the U.S. is taking a more cautious approach to Taiwan. In recent months, the Biden administration has emphasized the importance of maintaining stability in the region, and has sought to engage with China on a number of issues.\nAt the same time, the administration has also been strengthening its military presence in the region, with several high-profile naval exercises in the South China Sea. This has raised concerns among some experts that the U.S. is trying to provoke China into a conflict over Taiwan.\nDespite these concerns, many experts remain optimistic that a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue can be found. They argue that diplomacy and open communication between the U.S. and China is key to avoiding any potential conflict.\n\"At the end of the day, everyone has a stake in maintaining peace and stability in the region,\" says Dr. Zhang. \"We need to focus on finding solutions that work for everyone, rather than escalating tensions and risking a major conflict.\"", "The Voisey's Bay nickel production project in Newfoundland, Canada is facing a significant setback due to environmental and Aboriginal pressures.

Additionally, the Newfoundland and Labrador Government has yet to approve the project's environmental impact assessment. The mining company, Vale, has acknowledged the concerns and is working to address them in consultation with Indigenous communities and government officials. The delay of the project's start date is inevitable due to the ongoing pressures.", "China announced on Monday that it will give Hong Kong courts new powers to handle trials of off-duty soldiers from its People's Liberation Army (PLA), thereby enhancing the legal authority of the semi-autonomous city.\nThis decision is a significant change in how China operates its military justice system in Hong Kong. Previously, any PLA soldier who committed a crime while off-duty would be tried in the mainland's military courts. However, the new measures will allow Hong Kong courts to take on these cases, except for ones related to national security or cases that PLA authorities deem to be \"special\" and, therefore, more sensitive.\nThe move comes as tensions between the Chinese military and Hong Kong residents are on the rise, particularly amid widespread protests against Beijing's imposition of a controversial national security law in the city. Critics of the law say that it undermines Hong Kong's autonomy and erodes the protections of basic human rights.\nUnder the new regulations, Hong Kong courts will not have jurisdiction over cases such as those related to military discipline, national defense, foreign exchanges, or when the PLA is executing its duties under government orders. Moreover, cases that involve sensitive information or might affect national security will not be eligible for Hong Kong courts.\nAdditionally, the Chinese military will still be responsible for maintaining the discipline of its troops stationed in Hong Kong, investigating allegations against soldiers and reporting its findings to the Hong Kong government.\nHong Kong's current legal system is based on a common law tradition, which is different from China's civil law system. The difference in legal systems has led to some concerns about how the new regulations will be implemented.\nThe Hong Kong Bar Association expressed optimism about the decision and said it would help clarify the legal processes for handling off-duty soldier trials. However, some legal experts worry that the new measures may not be enough to safeguard Hong Kong's autonomy.\nPreviously, the Chinese military stationed in Hong Kong has not been subject to local laws and has sometimes even refused to cooperate with local authorities. According to Hong Kong's Basic Law, the legal framework that defines the city's relationship with the mainland, the Chinese military's activities in Hong Kong must be approved by the local government.\nThis decision to empower Hong Kong courts to handle off-duty soldier trials has been praised by some as a step in the right direction towards greater autonomy for Hong Kong. Still, it will take some time to see how the new measures are implemented and whether they will help to alleviate some of the concerns about Chinese influence in Hong Kong's legal system.", "Russia\u2019s Fuel and Energy Ministry Struggles to Redefine Itself in New Market Economy, Analysts Say\nRussia\u2019s Fuel and Energy Ministry is facing significant challenges in the new market economy, and experts warn that changes are necessary for the ministry to remain relevant.\nThe ministry oversees Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas industry, which has long been the country\u2019s economic backbone. However, the global shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources has forced the ministry to confront a rapidly changing landscape.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s oil and gas industry is facing unprecedented challenges,\u201d said Alexei Miller, head of the state-owned energy company Gazprom. \u201cThe ministry needs to rethink its role in this new market.\u201d\nThe ministry has announced a number of initiatives to address these challenges, including increased investment in renewable energy, increased cybersecurity measures, and efforts to increase transparency and accountability.\nHowever, experts say that these initiatives do not go far enough, and that the ministry needs to fundamentally redefine itself in order to remain relevant.\n\u201cThere needs to be a fundamental shift in how the ministry thinks about its role in the energy industry,\u201d said Sergei Alexashenko, a former deputy finance minister and current senior fellow at the Moscow-based Carnegie Center. \u201cThis is a critical moment for the industry, and the ministry needs to lead the way forward.\u201d\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the ministry is the global shift towards renewable energy sources. While Russia\u2019s oil and gas industry remains strong, the growing popularity of renewable energy means that the demand for fossil fuels is likely to decline in the coming years.\nThis trend is particularly worrisome for Russia, which relies heavily on oil and gas exports to fuel its economy. The country ranks fourth in the world in terms of oil production and second in terms of natural gas production, and the industry accounts for a significant portion of the country\u2019s GDP.\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced a number of initiatives to promote renewable energy, including increased investment in wind and solar energy. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to keep pace with the changing energy landscape.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to be much more aggressive in promoting renewable energy,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a huge opportunity for Russia, but it requires a major shift in how the ministry thinks about its role.\u201d\nAnother challenge facing the ministry is cybersecurity. The increasing reliance on technology in the energy industry has made it more vulnerable to cyber attacks, and experts warn that the ministry needs to take steps to protect its infrastructure.\n\u201cWe are seeing more and more cyber attacks targeting the energy industry,\u201d said Vladimir Putin, president of Russia. \u201cThe ministry needs to take these threats seriously and take steps to protect our infrastructure.\u201d\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced plans to increase cybersecurity measures, including the creation of a national cybersecurity center. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to protect against the growing threat of cyber attacks.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to prioritize cybersecurity and make it a core part of its strategy,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a critical issue that cannot be ignored.\u201d\nFinally, the ministry is facing increasing pressure to increase transparency and accountability. The industry has long been associated with corruption and backroom deals, and experts say that the ministry needs to take steps to address these issues.\n\u201cThe energy industry is notorious for corruption and lack of transparency,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThe ministry needs to take steps to increase transparency and accountability, otherwise it will continue to lose credibility.\u201d\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced plans to increase transparency and accountability, including increased reporting requirements and the establishment of a public registry of energy industry contracts. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to address the deep-seated corruption in the industry.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to be much more aggressive in addressing corruption,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a huge issue that cannot be ignored.\u201d\nOverall, experts say that the ministry needs to fundamentally redefine itself in order to remain relevant in the new market economy. This will require a major shift in how the ministry thinks about its role, as well as a willingness to embrace change and innovation.\n\u201cThis is a critical moment for the energy industry,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThe ministry needs to lead the way forward, or it risks being left behind.\u201d", "Toronto, Canada - The city of Toronto is bracing for a near-total shutdown as protesters take to the streets to voice their opposition against the proposed budget cuts. The demonstration follows the release of the city's 2021 budget, which includes significant cuts to various programs and services, including public health, affordable housing, and education.\nThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Toronto to demonstrate against the proposed budget cuts. The protesters consist of various groups, including educators, healthcare workers, low-income families, and indigenous peoples, who argue that they will be the most negatively impacted by these cuts.\nThe demonstration, which began peacefully, quickly turned violent as several groups of protesters broke away from the main group and began vandalizing public property. Protesters smashed windows of several businesses, and some even torched cars parked on the street. Police responded by trying to disperse the crowd with tear gas, but the violence continued.\nThe situation escalated as police tried to contain the riots, causing several injuries and arrests. Toronto Mayor John Tory addressed the situation in a press conference, calling on the protestors to remain peaceful. \"I understand that people are upset about the proposed budget cuts, but resorting to violence and vandalism is not the answer. I urge everyone to remain calm and express their frustration through peaceful means.\"\nThe proposed budget cuts have been met with widespread criticism from individuals and organizations across Toronto and Canada. Critics argue that the cuts will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable members of the community, including low-income families, seniors, and indigenous peoples.\nOne of the key cuts proposed in the budget is a reduction in public health funding, which includes a 10% cut to the city's public health budget. This cut is even more concerning as the city continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. The cuts also include a reduction in affordable housing funding and the closure of several community centers.\nThe proposed budget cuts have also raised concerns from educators, who argue that the cuts will lead to a reduction in education quality. The cuts include a reduction in funding for school boards, which will result in larger class sizes and reduced resources for students and teachers.\nCritics argue that the city's budget cuts are a result of poor government decision-making, and that the government should focus on finding alternative solutions to balance the budget. The proposed budget cuts also come at a time when the government has increased spending on several large-scale projects, including the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) expansion project.\nThe budget cuts have also raised concerns about the city's ability to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has hit the city's economy hard, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat. The proposed budget cuts could further worsen the city's economic situation, leading to higher unemployment rates and reduced economic activity.\nIn response to the protests, the city's government has called for a dialogue with the protesters to discuss their concerns and find alternative solutions to the proposed budget cuts. However, the protesters have made it clear that they will not back down until the cuts are removed from the budget.\nThe situation in Toronto remains tense, with the city on the brink of a near-total shutdown. The proposed budget cuts have led to widespread anger and frustration, and it is clear that the city's government will need to find alternative solutions to balance the budget without negatively impacting the most vulnerable members of the community.\nIn the meanwhile, Toronto remains on edge, with the government and protesters locked in a standoff. The coming days will be crucial in determining the fate of the proposed budget cuts and the future of the city for years to come.", "British Energy Plc, the leading energy supplier in the United Kingdom, announced on Monday that it will make job cuts and introduce cost savings measures in a bid to boost profits. The move has been met with opposition criticism, with the opposition parties calling the decision'unacceptable'.\nThe company said that it plans to cut around 200 jobs across a range of functions, including management positions, in order to reduce its costs. The move is expected to save the troubled energy supplier around \u00a330 million annually.\nIn addition to job cuts, the company will introduce cost savings measures, which include reducing expenses on travel, consultants, and office space. This is part of the company's efforts to streamline its operations, which it says will help it compete in an increasingly challenging market.\nHowever, the move has been criticised by opposition parties, who argue that British Energy Plc should not be cutting jobs and making cost savings at a time when the UK is facing huge economic challenges. The Labour Party has called on the government to take action to protect jobs and support the energy sector during the current economic downturn.\nCommenting on the announcement, Labour MP Angela Eagle said: \"British Energy Plc's decision to cut jobs and introduce cost savings is unacceptable. The government must take urgent action to protect jobs in the energy sector and to support workers who are facing job losses during this difficult period.\"\nThe company has defended its decision, saying that it is necessary to implement these cost-saving measures to remain competitive in a challenging market. The company has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in energy demand and a fall in energy prices.\nIn addition to the current economic challenges, British Energy Plc is also facing increasing competition from renewable energy suppliers, who are able to offer environmentally friendly and cost-effective energy alternatives to consumers.\nDespite the opposition's criticism, the company says that it remains committed to investing in renewable energy and reducing its carbon footprint. The company plans to invest over \u00a39 billion in renewable energy projects over the next five years, which it says will help it to meet the UK's ambitious carbon reduction targets.\nThe announcement of job cuts and cost savings comes as energy suppliers across the UK are facing increasing pressure to reduce their operating costs and to explore new ways of generating energy. British Energy Plc's decision is likely to be closely watched by other energy suppliers, who may follow suit by implementing similar cost-saving measures.", "As the telecom industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, analysts are predicting that media conglomerate News Corp could emerge as a clear winner from the recently announced merger between MCI (formerly known as WorldCom) and British Telecom (BT).\nThe $34 billion merger, which will create a global player in the telecommunications market, has raised several concerns among investors and analysts about its potential impact on competition, pricing, and market share. However, some experts believe that News Corp, which owns a portfolio of media properties including Fox News, the New York Post, and the Wall Street Journal, could benefit from the deal.\nOne of the main advantages for News Corp is the potential for increased advertising revenue from the combined customer base of MCI and BT, which consists of millions of businesses and consumers across the world. According to media analysts, the merger creates a significant opportunity for News Corp to expand its digital and mobile advertising offerings, as well as its content distribution capabilities.\n\"News Corp has a broad range of media properties that appeal to businesses and consumers, and this merger gives them access to a much larger audience,\" said Harry Marks, an analyst at Wall Street firm Bernstein. \"As more companies move their businesses online and adopt digital marketing strategies, News Corp is well-positioned to benefit from this shift.\"\nIn addition to advertising revenue, News Corp could also gain from increased content partnerships with the merged MCI-BT entity. With its expertise in news and entertainment content, as well as its strong digital presence, News Corp could be a valuable partner for the new telecom giant in delivering high-quality content to its customers.\nFurthermore, the merger could also help News Corp expand its international footprint, particularly in the European and Asian markets where MCI and BT have a significant presence. This could be particularly beneficial for the company's sports and entertainment properties, which have a global appeal and could benefit from increased exposure in new markets.\nHowever, some analysts caution that News Corp's potential gains are not without risks. The telecom industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and there is no guarantee that the merged entity will be successful in integrating its operations and maintaining market share.\nMoreover, News Corp faces challenges from the rise of digital competitors, such as Facebook and Google, which have disrupted the traditional media landscape and siphoned ad revenue away from legacy media companies. While News Corp has made efforts to diversify its revenue streams and invest in digital platforms, it still faces intense competition in the digital advertising market.\n\"Increasing advertising revenue is only part of the equation for News Corp,\" said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at City University of New York. \"They also need to focus on delivering high-quality content that resonates with their audience and distinguishes them from the competition.\"\nDespite these challenges, analysts remain bullish on News Corp's prospects in the wake of the MCI-BT merger. The company has a strong track record of navigating the tumultuous media landscape and adapting to changing market conditions, and it could emerge as a significant player in the telecom industry as a result of the merger.\n\"As the media and telecom industries continue to converge, there will be opportunities for companies that can offer a unique value proposition to customers,\" said Bernstein's Marks. \"News Corp has a lot to offer in terms of content, distribution, and digital capabilities, and the MCI-BT merger could be a catalyst for them to capitalize on these strengths.\"", "JAKARTA - Indonesia's capital market has taken a significant step forward after the country's regulator, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), issued new mutual fund regulations earlier this month. According to industry experts, these regulations are set to become a landmark for the local industry, and are expected to boost investor confidence in the country's mutual funds market.\nThe new regulations are aimed at increasing transparency and accountability across mutual funds in Indonesia. Under the new rules, mutual fund providers are required to provide more information about their funds, including their portfolio holdings, management fees, and performance data. This information will be made available to investors via online platforms, as well as through other channels.\nThe regulations also require mutual fund providers to implement stricter risk management systems, which will help to protect investors from the risks associated with investing in these funds. This includes the requirement for providers to conduct in-depth risk assessments of their portfolio holdings, as well as to implement procedures for monitoring and managing risk.\nAccording to experts, these regulations are a major step forward for Indonesia's mutual funds market, and will help to bring it more in line with international standards. This will be beneficial for both investors and the wider Indonesian economy, as it will help to attract foreign investment and promote growth in the financial sector.\nIn a statement, the OJK said that the new regulations were designed to \"strengthen the sustainability of the mutual fund industry, and encourage more investment, both domestically and internationally\". The regulator also noted that the regulations were based on international best practices, and had been developed in consultation with industry stakeholders.\nThe industry has welcomed the new regulations, with many providers hailing them as a major boost for the sector. \"These regulations are a landmark for the mutual fund industry in Indonesia,\" said Iwan Kurniawan, CEO of PT NTG Capital. \"They will help to increase transparency and accountability, and will provide investors with more confidence in the market.\"\nOther industry leaders echoed this sentiment, with many highlighting the potential benefits of the new regulations for the wider economy. \"These regulations will help to promote growth in the financial sector, and will attract more foreign investment into the country,\" said Hariadi Sukamdani, the Chairman of the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo).\nDespite the positive response, some analysts have highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the new regulations to ensure their effectiveness. \"While these regulations are a step in the right direction, it is important that they are enforced and monitored effectively,\" said Dimas Seto, a capital markets analyst at Bank Mandiri. \"This will help to ensure that the market remains transparent and accountable, and that investors are protected.\"\nOverall, however, the mood in the mutual funds industry is optimistic, with many in the sector predicting a bright future for mutual funds in Indonesia. \"These regulations will help to place Indonesia's mutual funds market on a level playing field with other markets around the world,\" said Iwan Kurniawan. \"We believe that this will help to attract more investors and promote the development of the Indonesian economy.\"", "Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is set to acquire a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit as part of its ambitious growth strategy.\nThe Japanese insurer is expected to complete the acquisition of 51% of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. by the end of 2021, pending regulatory approval.\nYasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. aims to steer growth with the acquisition, as it enters into the health and life insurance sector along with its traditional property-casualty insurance business.\nThe move will also help CIGNA streamline its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.\nCIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.\nThe insurance unit has suffered some hit in recent years due to changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates.\nYasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to invigorate the unit with increased capital while taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population.\n\"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage,\" said Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.'s President and CEO, Akio Kiyotani.\nThe deal also marks the latest move in a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographics and intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe deal follows Nippon Life Insurance's announcement in September 2020 that it would acquire 85% of the shares in MassMutual Japan Ltd., the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.\nThe acquisition by Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to enhance the company's position in the competitive insurance market, with CIGNA also benefiting from a considerable capital injection to enhance its operational efficiency.\nThe terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Still, Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive the financial backing required to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market better.", "Beijing, China - The joint venture between Volkswagen AG, the largest car manufacturer in Europe, and China's state-owned First Automotive Works (FAW) has denied reports about its possible closure, despite headwinds from the ongoing trade war.\nRecently, rumors surfaced that the German automaker's joint venture with FAW could be shut down for refusing to localize an electric car platform in China, which would make it harder for the company to compete with local rivals in the world's biggest auto market.\nHowever, in a statement released on Monday, Volkswagen-FAW said that it was \"untrue\" that the alliance's partnership faced the possibility of being dissolved.\n\"The reports are totally groundless. The joint venture is operating actively and orderly as always,\" the statement said, adding that it would \"continue its strategic partnership in China.\"\nDespite a challenging year for automakers, Volkswagen-FAW is performing relatively well. The company said it sold 2.28 million vehicles in China from January to October this year, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year.\nIt is worth noting that Volkswagen is a leading automaker in China, having sold over four million cars there in 2018. The German car giant also has joint ventures with two other Chinese carmakers, SAIC Motor Corp and JAC Motors.\nNonetheless, the auto industry is facing intense competition in the world's second-largest economy, as local players such as BYD Co, Geely Automobile Holdings, and BAIC Motor continue to ramp up their production of electric vehicles.\nTo cope with the shifting market landscape, Volkswagen-FAW has been building local production capacities and developing its electric vehicle technology. The joint venture also said earlier this year that it would invest around $2.5 billion in the development of new energy vehicles, and set a sales goal of one million such vehicles annually by 2025.\nDespite the ongoing trade war between China and the United States, Volkswagen-FAW's operations appear to be stable, with the company expressing optimism about its future prospects in the Chinese market.\n\"The joint venture will keep up with market changes and customer demand to bring more high-quality products to the Chinese market,\" the statement said.", "AT&T Struggles to Keep Up with Rivals in $75 Billion Long Distance Market\nAT&T, once the undisputed leader in the US long distance market, is struggling to keep up with its rivals in a sector that has grown into a $75 billion industry. The company has lost significant market share in recent years, as new technologies and aggressive competitors eat into its customer base.\nAccording to a recent report from research firm IBISWorld, the long distance market in the US has grown by 1.7% per year on average over the past five years, as increasing numbers of consumers turn to digital services like Skype and WhatsApp for their long distance calling needs. This has put pressure on traditional long distance carriers like AT&T, who are struggling to compete with the low prices and convenience of digital alternatives.\n\"The long distance market has changed dramatically in recent years,\" said Jim Bak, an analyst at IBISWorld. \"With the rise of digital services, consumers have more options than ever before. AT&T is struggling to keep up with this rapid pace of change, and as a result, is losing out to its competitors.\"\nAT&T's struggles in the long distance market can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rise of digital services and the aggressive pricing strategies of its rivals. Companies like Sprint and Verizon have been able to offer lower prices and more flexible plans, which has helped them to win customers away from AT&T.\nAnother factor is the increasing popularity of prepaid long distance plans. These plans allow customers to pay for their long distance calls in advance, which can be more cost-effective than traditional long distance plans. Many of AT&T's rivals have been quick to offer prepaid plans, which has helped them to attract price-sensitive customers who might otherwise have chosen AT&T.\nDespite these challenges, AT&T remains a major player in the long distance market, with a market share of around 25%. The company still offers a range of long distance plans, including unlimited plans for frequent callers and more affordable plans for occasional users.\nHowever, to stay competitive in the long distance market, AT&T will need to adapt to the changing needs and preferences of its customers. This means adopting new technologies and services, and offering more flexible pricing plans to attract and retain customers.\nOne area where AT&T is making progress is in the area of digital services. The company has launched its own video conferencing service, AT&T Video Meetings, which allows users to connect with colleagues and customers from anywhere in the world. The service has been well-received by customers, and has helped AT&T to compete more effectively with digital rivals like Skype and Zoom.\nAT&T is also investing heavily in its network infrastructure, in order to provide faster and more reliable long distance services. The company has rolled out 5G technology in several markets across the US, which has the potential to revolutionize the long distance market by offering faster speeds and lower latency.\nDespite these efforts, however, AT&T faces an uphill battle in the long distance market. Its rivals are continuing to invest in new technologies and services, and are aggressively pursuing new customers. If AT&T is to stay relevant in this highly competitive sector, it will need to be both nimble and innovative, and continue to put the needs of its customers first.", "The former U.S ambassador to China, Winston Lord, just completed a three-day visit to Beijing, China, where he held private and cordial talks with senior officials on the issues of human rights and North Korea's nuclear program.\nLord arrived in Beijing on Monday and held several closed-door meetings with Chinese officials. In an interview with the press, he described the talks as \"candid, constructive and cordial.\"\nDuring his stay in Beijing, Lord discussed with senior officials about the importance of human rights protection in China. He urged the Chinese government to release all political prisoners and stop the ongoing surveillance of activists.\n\"I have raised concerns about the current human rights situation in China, particularly the treatment of human rights activists, lawyers, and dissidents,\" Lord said.\nLord's visit came amid tensions between the U.S. and China over human rights issues and trade. The relationship between the two nations has been strained for some time, with the U.S. government accusing China of engaging in unfair trade practices.\nHowever, Lord's approach was a departure from the Trump administration's public criticism of China's human rights record. Rather than criticizing the country publicly, Lord decided to engage in private dialogue with Chinese officials.\n\"I think it's important to engage with the Chinese authorities in a constructive manner to try and effect positive change in this area,\" he said.\nLord also discussed the situation in North Korea, urging China to continue to leverage its influence on the reclusive regime to halt its nuclear program. North Korea has continued to defy international sanctions, and its leader, Kim Jong-un, has refused to abandon his country's nuclear program.\n\"China has a critical role to play in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. I have urged the Chinese authorities to continue their efforts to encourage the North Korean regime to denuclearize and engage in peaceful negotiations,\" Lord said.\nDespite the ongoing discussions, Lord's visit to China received little attention from the press. It is not clear if he met with President Xi Jinping, who recently concluded a meeting with President Trump in Florida.\nLord's visit comes ahead of other high-profile visits to China by U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Trump himself. Tillerson is scheduled to visit Beijing later this month to hold talks with Chinese officials on North Korea and trade.\nThe U.S. has been increasing pressure on China to take more decisive action to address North Korea's nuclear program. The Trump administration has said that all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with North Korea, including military action.\nMeanwhile, tensions between the two nations over trade continue to simmer. President Trump has accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and dumping.\nLord's visit is seen as a significant step towards improving the relationship between the two countries. The veteran diplomat has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, but he has also emphasized the importance of engagement and dialogue.\n\"As a former ambassador to China, I know how important it is to maintain constructive dialogue with the Chinese government, even when we have disagreements,\" Lord said.\nOverall, Lord's visit to Beijing was seen as a positive development in relations between the U.S. and China. With more high-profile visits scheduled in the coming weeks, it remains to be seen whether the two nations can work together to resolve their differences and improve their relationship.", "British Airways and Groupe Rivaud have made a joint bid for French regional airline Air Liberte. The airline, which was in financial trouble, was put up for sale earlier this year.\nThe bid is said to be worth around \u20ac10 million, and includes the purchasing of the airline\u2019s fleet and taking on its employees.\nAir Liberte currently operates flights from several French regional airports including Lyon, Marseille, Nice and Toulouse.

Air Liberte has a rich history in the French aviation industry, and we look forward to working together to create a stronger and more successful airline.\u201d\nThe move comes at a time when the airline industry is going through a period of consolidation and restructuring, as airlines seek to navigate the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The acquisition of Air Liberte by British Airways and Groupe Rivaud comes at a time when many airlines are seeking to expand their regional networks to capture market share.\nBritish Airways\u2019 bid for Air Liberte is the latest move by the airline to expand its presence in Europe. Earlier this year, the airline launched new routes to destinations such as Montpellier and Bordeaux in France, and Palermo and Catania in Italy.\nThe acquisition is subject to regulatory approval from French authorities, and if approved, is expected to be completed in the coming months.\nIn summary, British Airways and Groupe Rivaud have made a joint bid for French airline Air Liberte, which would see the airline merge with British Airways\u2019 regional subsidiary, BA CityFlyer.

With the advancement of technology, businesses can now easily expand their horizons and reach beyond their local markets. However, this has given rise to a new set of challenges, especially in terms of regulations and boundaries.\nThe growth of online commerce has brought new opportunities for businesses to thrive. Companies can now expand their reach to a global audience and offer their products and services to customers across the globe. However, this globalization of online commerce also brings regulatory complexities that companies must navigate in order to operate internationally.\nThe challenge for businesses today is to comply with the regulations and boundaries set by different countries. The internet has made it possible for companies to reach customers in different countries with ease. However, this has also created a situation where businesses have to comply with different regulations regarding taxes, data privacy, and intellectual property rights.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing businesses today is the issue of data privacy. Different countries have different laws regarding how businesses can collect, use, and protect personal data of their customers. This has made it difficult for companies to comply with regulations while operating on a global scale. In the European Union, for example, businesses have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is one of the strictest data privacy laws in the world. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines and reputational damage.\nAnother challenge for businesses operating globally is the issue of taxes. Different countries have different tax laws that businesses must comply with. This has created a situation where businesses have to comply with multiple tax codes and deal with different tax authorities. This is further compounded by the fact that many countries are now implementing digital taxes which target online commerce. It is essential for businesses to stay up-to-date on the latest tax regulations in different countries to avoid penalties and other legal issues.\nThe issue of intellectual property (IP) rights is also a significant challenge for businesses operating in different countries. Different countries have different IP laws that businesses must comply with. This can be a difficult task, especially for small businesses that do not have the resources to navigate the complex legal landscape. Failure to comply with IP laws can lead to legal action and significant financial damages.\nIn conclusion, the globalization of online commerce has brought many new opportunities for businesses to expand their reach. However, it has also created a complex regulatory landscape that companies must navigate. It is essential for businesses to stay up-to-date on the latest regulations in different countries and to comply with them to avoid penalties and other legal issues. This is especially important for small businesses that do not have the resources to navigate the complex legal landscape on their own. By working with legal experts and using modern technology solutions, businesses can overcome these challenges and continue to grow in the era of globalization.", "Shares of educational publishing giant Pearson have witnessed an unprecedented surge on the stock market, following speculation of a potential takeover bid from BSkyB. The news of the potential acquisition sent share prices soaring, as investors scrambled to get a piece of the action.\nAccording to market sources, rumours of a tie-up between Pearson and BSkyB have been circulating in recent weeks. Industry analysts suggested that a merger between the two companies would be mutually beneficial, with BSkyB looking to diversify into new markets and Pearson seeking to expand its digital offerings in the wake of declining print sales.\nHowever, both companies have remained tight-lipped on the issue, with no official confirmation or denial of the reports. This has led to further speculation and increased activity in the stock market, as investors continue to ponder the potential implications of such a deal.\nThe news of a possible takeover bid has also sparked debate among industry experts, who have expressed mixed opinions on the matter. Some argue that a merger between Pearson and BSkyB would create a powerful new player in the education market, with the ability to offer integrated digital solutions and access to a vast network of customers and resources.\nOthers, however, have raised concerns over the potential impact on competition and innovation, as well as the potential risks of integrating two companies with vastly different cultures and business models.\nDespite these concerns, many investors seem to be betting on a positive outcome for the proposed deal, with Pearson shares reaching their highest level since March 2020. The surge in share prices has also boosted the company's market value by over \u00a3500m, highlighting the potential benefits of a successful merger.\nThe education market has been undergoing significant changes in recent years, as the shift towards digital learning and e-books continues to accelerate. This has put pressure on traditional publishing companies like Pearson, which have struggled to adapt to the new demands of the market.\nIn response, the company has been investing heavily in digital offerings and restructuring its operations to better match the needs of today's students. The proposed merger with BSkyB would further bolster these efforts, providing Pearson with access to a wider audience and new digital tools to deliver education content.\nBSkyB, for its part, has been looking to diversify its business away from traditional TV and media offerings, as the streaming market becomes increasingly crowded. The education sector presents a logical new frontier for the company, with the potential to tap into a growing market and leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise in digital content delivery.\nDespite the potential benefits of a merger between Pearson and BSkyB, however, there are also plenty of risks associated with such a deal. Integration and cultural clashes are common challenges in any merger, and the education sector is no exception.\nThere is also the risk of antitrust concerns, as the new company would likely have a significant market share in the education sector. This could lead to regulatory hurdles and delays in the approval process, which could impact the overall success of the deal.\nNevertheless, investors and industry analysts seem bullish on the prospects of a Pearson-BSkyB merger, with many seeing this as a positive development for both companies. What remains to be seen, however, is whether the two sides can reach an agreement and navigate the challenges of integration to create a successful new player in the education sector.\nOverall, the Pearson-BSkyB takeover speculation has generated significant buzz in the market, with investors and industry insiders closely watching for any further developments. While there are certainly risks involved in such a deal, the potential benefits could be substantial, and could provide a much-needed boost for both companies in the evolving educational landscape.", "London-based real estate investment firm, Land Securities, has revealed that it has observed an uptick in rental growth across the UK property market. This news comes after a period of uncertainty as to whether the market would recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, which had a severe impact on property transactions and rental incomes alike.\nThe company's latest report showed a 3% increase in rental value growth in the six months leading up to September, with overall occupancy rates also increasing. Land Securities, which is the UK's largest commercial property company, primarily focuses on offices, shopping centers, and residential properties.\nThe firm's CEO, Mark Allan, stated that these results indicate \"the beginnings of a recovery\" in the market. He also acknowledged that the company's portfolio has taken a hit in terms of valuation due to the pandemic, but added that its balance sheet remains strong, allowing the firm to capitalize on buying opportunities that may arise in the coming months.\nHowever, Allan warned that the market is still vulnerable to the impact of changing government policies relating to Covid-19 and Brexit. He added that the firm would continue to monitor such developments closely to ensure that they are well-positioned to react accordingly.\nThe report also noted several key trends in the market, including a shift towards more flexible working arrangements and a growing demand for outdoor spaces in urban areas. The shift towards hybrid working models has led to increased demand for spaces that are adaptable to different working styles, with companies seeking more collaborative and informal spaces.\nAdditionally, there has been a growing trend towards outdoor spaces in urban areas, as people increasingly seek access to green spaces and fresh air. This has led to greater investment in public spaces such as parks and gardens, as well as the incorporation of outdoor spaces into commercial properties.\nThe report also highlighted the resilience of the logistics sector, which has seen increased demand due to the surge in online shopping. Land Securities has invested heavily in this sector, with holdings including distribution centers and warehouses. This has helped to offset some of the losses incurred in other areas of the portfolio.\nThe news of rental growth has been broadly welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a positive sign for the market. However, some have cautioned that the recovery is still fragile, given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic and Brexit.\nRichard Donnell, director of research and insight at property data analysis firm Zoopla, stated that the market remained \"volatile and sensitive\" to these factors, and that sustained growth would depend on a range of external factors. He added that the market was likely to remain subdued in the short term, with the true impact of the pandemic still largely unknown.\nDespite these challenges, many industry insiders remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the UK property market. With the increased investment in flexible working arrangements and outdoor spaces, as well as the continued growth of e-commerce, there are many opportunities for companies to capitalize on these trends and adapt to the changing needs of consumers.\nOverall, Land Securities' report provides a glimmer of hope for the market, showing that rental growth is possible even in the most challenging of circumstances. As the market continues to evolve, it will be important for companies to remain agile and adaptable, so that they can take advantage of the opportunities that this challenging environment presents.", "Sainsbury's, the British supermarket giant, has announced plans to launch a new bank in partnership with Bank of Scotland, as they look to expand their financial services offering. The new bank, which will be jointly owned by both companies, is expected to begin operations by the end of 2021.\nAccording to the announcement, the new bank will focus on providing a range of innovative and competitive financial products to Sainsbury's customers across the United Kingdom. It will offer everything from savings accounts and personal loans to credit cards and insurance products, with a particular focus on digital banking services.\n\"This is an exciting new chapter in our journey to offer our customers more choice and value in everything we do,\" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's CEO. \"We are delighted to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, a trusted and established institution with a strong track record in financial services.\"\nThe move is part of Sainsbury's broader strategy to expand its reach beyond the traditional supermarket sector and become a more diversified and integrated retailer. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the company has been looking for ways to adapt to changing consumer habits and preferences, with a greater focus on e-commerce and digital services.\n\"We know that our customers are increasingly looking for convenient and accessible ways to manage their finances,\" said Roberts. \"By launching this joint venture with Bank of Scotland, we can offer them a broader range of financial products and services than ever before.\"\nThe partnership between Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland is not the first of its kind in the UK. Several other supermarkets, including Tesco and Marks & Spencer, already operate their own banking services, with varying degrees of success. However, Sainsbury's hopes to bring a unique combination of convenience, customer service, and value to the market, setting itself apart from its competitors.\n\"We believe that Sainsbury's Bank can offer something truly different and compelling to customers,\" said Roberts. \"Our focus will be on delivering great value, innovative products, and outstanding customer service, all backed by the strength and credibility of Bank of Scotland.\"\nThe news has been well-received by industry experts, who have praised Sainsbury's for its strategic vision and bold move into the financial services sector.\n\"This is a smart move by Sainsbury's,\" said Paul O'Connor, Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors. \"Expanding its reach into banking gives the company a new source of revenue and a way to deepen customer relationships. It also highlights the growing importance of digital services in the retail sector, which will only become more valuable in the years ahead.\"\nWith the launch of its new banking services imminent, Sainsbury's is set to become an even more formidable player in the increasingly competitive retail landscape of the UK. As consumers continue to embrace digital services and e-commerce, the company's decision to diversify its offerings could prove to be a shrewd investment.", "Beijing, China \u2013 China has suspended imports of US chicken meat due to concerns about the spread of avian influenza, commonly known as fowl or bird flu, according to Chinese authorities on Thursday.\nThe ban, which takes effect immediately, will impact the multi-million dollar export business which has been growing steadily over the last few years. The US exported more than $1 billion worth of poultry meat to China in 2020, making it one of the top markets for US chicken imports.\nThe Chinese government's decision was based on their belief that bird flu could be transmitted through the import of frozen poultry meat and other products, posing a risk to humans. This concern has led to the ban.\nThe US poultry industry, which is the largest in the world, has been hit hard by the ban. The National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, estimates the move will cut US poultry exports to China by up to 30%.\nThe council has called on US officials to work with their Chinese counterparts to resolve the issue quickly. \"We're disappointed with China's decision and we're working closely with the US government to resolve this issue,\" said Ashley Peterson, Senior Vice President of the National Chicken Council.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reassured consumers that US chicken is safe to eat and that the agency will continue to work with Chinese authorities to lift the ban. \u201cUSDA is committed to ensuring the safety and health of our food supply and the protection of both US and foreign consumers,\u201d said the agency in a statement.\nAccording to the USDA website, the export of US chicken to China was gradually increasing since 2013. The US poultry industry had been capitalizing on China\u2019s move to lift a ban on US chicken imports in 2013, after more than a decade of exclusion following an outbreak of bird flu in the US.\nAvian Influenza has been a serious concern for China in recent years. In 2020, the country reported several bird flu outbreaks in various areas, including an outbreak of H5N8 bird flu at a poultry farm in Qinghai Province. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can lead to human fatalities.\nChina is still coping with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from early 2020, and the year-long ban on poultry imports may weigh on the country's domestic supply. China has also banned poultry imports from other countries in the past citing bird flu concerns.\nThe ban comes as tensions between the US and China continue to rise, with both countries locked in a trade war, and amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The US poultry industry had benefited from the Phase 1 trade deal that was signed between the US and China in January 2020, under which China agreed to import an additional $200 billion of US goods and services.\nThe impact of this ban is not just on the US poultry industry but also on the Chinese consumers of chicken meat. According to reports, China represents the world's largest market for chicken meat consumption and the country has been importing frozen chicken meat to meet its growing domestic demand.\nThe suspension of US chicken imports also comes at a time when China is facing food supply chain disruption due to African swine fever decimating the country's pig population. This has led to a surge in demand for alternative protein sources, including chicken meat.\nThe ban may push China to explore alternative sources of protein, such as Brazilian chicken, which could be problematic for the US poultry industry, as China was the second-largest market for US poultry exports after Mexico.\nThe US and China have been in a trade war for almost two years now. The ban on US chicken imports is another example of how trade tensions between the two countries are affecting businesses and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.", "Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has withdrawn from the Czech Indoor Open due to a wrist injury. The 52-year-old German tennis legend was set to play in the doubles tournament alongside junior partner, Czech Republic's Jiri Vesely.\nBecker, who won six Grand Slam singles titles between 1985 and 1996, had been experiencing discomfort in his right wrist which he sustained from a fall earlier this month. He was advised by his doctors to rest and rehabilitate the injury which meant he had to withdraw from the upcoming tournament.\nIn a statement, Becker said, \"I'm naturally disappointed not to play in the Czech Indoor Open. The event holds a special place in my heart, and I was looking forward to partnering with Jiri Vesely. However, my health is of the utmost importance, and I need to allow my wrist ample time to heal.\"\nThe Czech Indoor Open, which runs from 19th to 25th October, is a popular ATP Tour event held annually in the Czech Republic. The tournament is part of the ATP Tour 250 series and attracts some of the world's best tennis players.\nBecker's withdrawal from the tournament is a significant blow to the event's organisers as he remains a crowd favourite and one of the biggest draws for the fans. Despite this setback, the organisers remain optimistic that the tournament will still attract top-class players in the absence of Becker.\nThe German legend has been serving as a tennis commentator and analyst for the BBC since retiring from professional tennis. He is considered one of the best tennis players of all time and is credited with revolutionising the sport with his fast-paced and aggressive play.\nBecker's fans will be hoping for a speedy recovery and his return to the tennis court as soon as possible.", "Amcor Ltd, the Australian global packaging company, is expected to report a heavy slump in its annual profit. However, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future recovery, as it deals with operational challenges, market shifts, and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.\nAccording to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg, Amcor is likely to report a 12.5% decline in net income to $302.5 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. This drop is mainly due to several one-time costs, including restructuring charges related to the acquisition of US-based rival Bemis Co, which was completed in June 2019.\nThe integration of Bemis has proved to be a challenging process for Amcor, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the company's supply chain and reduced demand for certain products. In May, Amcor announced that it would close four Bemis facilities in the US and cut a total of 500 jobs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and improve profitability.\nAmcor's results will also reflect the impact of weakening demand and fierce competition in the global packaging market, as well as the tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods since 2018. The trade tensions between the two countries have disrupted global trade flows, raised import costs, and caused uncertainty for businesses.\nDespite these headwinds, analysts believe that Amcor has a strong position in the packaging industry and is well-equipped to weather the current challenges. The company operates in 40 countries and serves a wide range of sectors, including food, beverage, healthcare, and personal care. It also has a solid track record of innovation, sustainability, and cost efficiency.\nMoreover, Amcor is expected to benefit from a shift towards sustainable packaging and e-commerce, which have accelerated during the pandemic. Consumers are increasingly demanding eco-friendly and convenient packaging solutions, while online retailers require more durable and protective packaging to cope with the rising volumes of shipments.\nAmcor has responded to these trends by launching several sustainable packaging products, such as the Greenlist program, which evaluates and improves the environmental performance of its materials and processes. The company has also expanded its e-commerce portfolio, with new products such as the e-Cube, a lighter and more space-efficient box designed for online orders.\nIn addition, Amcor has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and waste generation, by setting ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and recycling. The company aims to achieve 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025 and to reduce its carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030.\nThese initiatives are likely to enhance Amcor's competitiveness, profitability, and sustainability in the long term, according to analysts. They expect the company's earnings to rebound in the next fiscal year, as the Bemis acquisition benefits start to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and the global economy recovers.\n\"We remain positive on Amcor's outlook, given its strong market position, innovation capabilities, and sustainable product offerings,\" said Richard Jones, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"We see upside potential in the stock, as the market recognizes Amcor's long-term growth prospects and resilience.\"\nAmcor's shares have gained 7.5% this year, outpacing the 2.7% rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. The stock closed at $15.46 on Friday, with a market capitalization of $20.7 billion. The company is expected to report its full-year results on August 17.", "BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster has denied speculations regarding its plans to bid for Pearson, the London-based publishing company. The denial comes after rumors of BSkyB's interest in Pearson had hit the market, increasing the value of Pearson's shares by over 8% on Monday.\nThe news of the acquisition bid surfaced in The Sunday Times, which reported that BSkyB had hired advisers to examine a potential \u00a39bn ($12bn) takeover bid of Pearson. However, BSkyB was quick to deny any intention of such an acquisition. In a statement, BSkyB stated that they \"routinely consider various acquisitions and divestments,\" but they were categorically denying any plans for a takeover of Pearson.\"\nOn Monday, Pearson's shares went up by around 8.3% to 784.2p, valuing the company at \u00a39.3bn ($12.2bn), its highest level in three years. This reflected the investors' view that Pearson would be an attractive acquisition target, particularly given its recent restructuring and job cuts as part of efforts to adapt to tougher market conditions.\nPearson is the world's largest education company and the owner of the Financial Times newspaper. However, in recent years, its profitability has been challenged due to a decline in print revenues and significant technology disruption in the education industry. The company has responded by revamping its focus on digital education products, selling off non-core assets, and cutting thousands of jobs.\nBSkyB, on the other hand, is a satellite broadcaster that has transformed into a major producer of TV content in recent years. It has been expanding internationally and adding to its own portfolio of program commissions, such as Riviera and Jamestown. The company is owned by US media giant Comcast, which acquired it in late 2018 in a deal worth \u00a330bn ($39bn).\nMany investors see the potential acquisition of Pearson by BSkyB as a logical move. Pearson's education-focused assets, when combined with BSkyB's offerings, could create a powerful presence in the education media space. Pearson's recent pivot toward digital education content is also well-aligned with the online video market that BSkyB has been expanding into in recent years.\nThis acquisition would also expand the scope of BSkyB's offerings, potentially placing them in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV. Another driver of the acquisition could be the fact that Pearson, the Financial Times' parent, would give BSkyB an entryway into the financial media world, which could be lucrative.\nHowever, the proposed takeover would face many obstacles. Some analysts believe that the UK government would be unlikely to approve the deal due to media ownership regulations. Also, it is uncertain whether Pearson's board would be willing to sell the company. Furthermore, there could be other interested bidders, potentially driving up the price of the acquisition.\nDespite the uncertainty, there is no doubt that BSkyB's denial of the acquisition has disappointed some investors who saw the acquisition as an attractive proposition. They may also have been hoping for a repeat of Comcast's acquisition of Sky in 2018, which saw a bidding war with Fox that ultimately led to Sky becoming part of the Comcast empire.\nFor now, the speculation has caused an increase in the value of Pearson's shares, but only time will tell whether a deal will ever materialize.", "The Big Three U.S. Automakers \u2013 General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler \u2013 are poised to see nearly $2 billion profits in the third quarter of 2021. This is after a turbulent year in which the pandemic brought production to a standstill and caused significant financial losses for the auto industry.\nGeneral Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, is expected to report a profit of $1.8 billion for the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the previous year. The company has benefitted from strong demand for its trucks and SUVs, particularly in the North American market. In addition, GM has been able to offset the impact of higher commodity prices by implementing cost-saving measures.\nFord, the second-largest automaker, is expected to post a profit of $1 billion, up from $436 million in the previous year. The company has also seen strong demand for its trucks and SUVs, as well as the new Ford Bronco, which has been a hit with consumers. In addition, Ford has been able to reduce costs by restructuring its operations and focusing on its core products.\nFiat Chrysler, which recently merged with French automaker PSA to form Stellantis, is expected to report a profit of $124 million for the quarter. This is down from $1.4 billion in the previous year, but still a solid result given the challenges faced by the industry. Stellantis has been able to benefit from strong demand for its Jeep brand, as well as cost-saving measures implemented as part of the merger.\nThe strong performance of the Big Three automakers reflects the broader recovery of the U.S. economy, which has been bolstered by government stimulus measures and a rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, low interest rates have encouraged consumers to purchase new vehicles, particularly larger models that generate higher profits for automakers.\nHowever, there are also challenges on the horizon. The global shortage of semiconductor chips continues to impact the auto industry, leading to production slowdowns and backlogs of orders. In addition, concerns over inflation and supply chain disruptions could create headwinds for the industry in the coming months.\nDespite these risks, the Big Three automakers are cautiously optimistic about the future. GM recently announced plans to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. Ford and Stellantis also have ambitious plans to transition towards electric vehicles, as well as to develop new mobility services and technologies.\nThe shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles represents a major opportunity for the auto industry, as well as for the broader economy. The transition is expected to create millions of jobs in areas such as battery production, charging infrastructure, and software development. It could also have significant environmental benefits, as electric vehicles produce fewer emissions than traditional cars and trucks.\nHowever, the transition will not be without its challenges. Electric vehicles currently represent a small fraction of total vehicle sales, and it will take time for consumers to adapt to the new technology. In addition, the development of autonomous vehicles is still in its early stages, and there are significant legal and regulatory hurdles that will need to be overcome.\nThe Big Three automakers are well-positioned to navigate these challenges, given their size, scale, and experience. They also have a strong track record of innovation and adaptation, having weathered numerous disruptions over the past century.\nIn conclusion, the expected $2 billion profits for the Big Three U.S. Automakers in the third quarter of 2021 is a sign of the industry\u2019s resilience and recovery. However, the challenges facing the industry are significant, and the transition towards electric and autonomous vehicles represents a major opportunity and a major risk. It will be important for the auto industry, policymakers, and consumers to work together to ensure a smooth and successful transition towards a more sustainable and innovative future.", "GTE Corp, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, announced on Monday that it expects to continue increasing its earnings per share (EPS) by at least 10% for the foreseeable future. This is due to the company's rising revenues, which were fueled by its recent acquisition of several smaller companies.\n\"We are very pleased with the progress we have made over the past year,\" said GTE CEO Richard Notebaert. \"Our strong financial performance is a result of our focus on customer service and our commitment to investing in our network and technology infrastructure.\"\nGTE reported earnings of $2.10 per share in the third quarter, up from $1.85 per share in the same period last year. The company's revenue also increased to $33.8 billion in the quarter, up from $31.2 billion in the same period last year.\n\"The third quarter results were very strong,\" said Notebaert. \"We saw growth across all of our business segments, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong growth going forward.\"\nGTE's recent acquisition of several smaller companies has helped boost its revenue growth. In June, the company announced that it had acquired Internet service provider MCI Communications for $37 billion. The deal gave GTE control of one of the largest Internet backbones in the world and expanded its customer base.\n\"We are excited about the opportunities that the MCI acquisition has created for us,\" said Notebaert. \"We now have a broader portfolio of services to offer our customers, and we are seeing strong demand for these services.\"\nGTE has also been investing in its network and technology infrastructure in order to better serve its customers. The company has been rolling out new fiber-optic networks in major metropolitan areas, which offer faster Internet speeds and better connectivity.\n\"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service,\" said Notebaert. \"That means investing in our network and technology infrastructure to ensure that we can deliver fast, reliable service to all of our customers.\"\nAnalysts are bullish on GTE's future prospects, citing the company's strong financial performance and its focus on customer service.\n\"GTE has done a great job of executing on its strategic goals,\" said analyst Michael Rollins. \"The company has a solid customer base and a strong infrastructure, which should continue to drive growth going forward.\"\nRollins also noted that GTE's focus on customer service has helped set it apart from its competitors.\n\"Customer service is becoming increasingly important in the telecommunications industry,\" said Rollins. \"GTE has done a great job of focusing on this area, which should help it continue to attract and retain customers.\"\nDespite its strong financial performance, GTE faces several challenges going forward. The company is facing increased competition from other telecommunications companies, as well as regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\"The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and GTE will need to continue to innovate in order to stay ahead of its competitors,\" said Rollins. \"The FCC is also keeping a close eye on the industry, which could lead to more regulation in the future.\"\nDespite these challenges, GTE remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company has a strong customer base and a solid infrastructure, which should continue to fuel growth going forward.", "Ford Motor Company and the Detroit Lions are reportedly in talks over a multi-million dollar naming rights agreement for the Lions' new stadium currently under construction in downtown Detroit. Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the deal could be worth up to $150 million over a 20 year term.\nThe new stadium is expected to be the centerpiece of a revitalized downtown area and is scheduled to open in 2022. It will replace the Lions' current home at Ford Field which opened in 2002 and seats just over 65,000 fans. Details of the new stadium's capacity, design and features have not yet been made public.\nIf completed, the deal would be the latest in a string of high-profile sports naming rights agreements between auto manufacturers and professional sports franchises, with recent examples including Mercedes-Benz's naming rights for the Atlanta Falcons' Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Audi's deal with Major League Soccer's D.C. United for Audi Field.\nRepresentatives of Ford and the Detroit Lions declined to comment on the reports of a naming rights deal, citing ongoing negotiations. However, both parties have previously expressed a desire to expand their partnership, with Ford already serving as the Lions' official vehicle since 2014.\nThe potential partnership would not only bring in significant revenue for both Ford and the Lions, but it would also create a strong Detroit-based branding opportunity that could reiterate the recent resurgence of the city as a major economic player in the United States.\nThe new Detroit stadium naming deal is yet to be finalised. Still, the possibility is already generating excitement among fans, businesses and city leaders alike. Detroit's recent revitalisation, coupled with Ford's long history in the city, has set the stage for a truly significant partnership that could benefit both the automaker and the city for years to come.", "The European Parliament has awarded Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for his outstanding contribution towards upholding human rights and democracy in China. Beijing, however, called it a \"rude interference\" in its internal affairs and warned of consequences.\nWei Jingsheng is a renowned human rights activist who has been a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party and its policies for over four decades. He is best known for his role in the Democracy Wall movement of 1978, where he wrote articles advocating for political reform and democracy in China. For his activism, he was arrested in 1979 and spent 18 years in prison, where he was subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment.\nSince his release in 1997, Wei has continued to speak out against the CCP's human rights abuses, censorship, and suppression of dissent. He has advocated for the rights of ethnic minorities, including Tibetans and Uighurs, and has called for an end to the one-party rule in China.\nThe Sakharov Prize, named after the Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, is awarded annually by the European Parliament to individuals or groups who have made significant contributions to the promotion of human rights and democracy. The prize is considered one of the most prestigious accolades in the field of human rights.\nThe selection of Wei Jingsheng for the Sakharov Prize this year has been met with mixed reactions. While human rights organizations and activists have welcomed the decision, the Chinese government has criticized it as a \"rude interference\" in its internal affairs.\nIn a statement, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, \"We firmly oppose any country or organization to use the issue of human rights to interfere with China's internal affairs.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in Brussels also expressed its displeasure with the decision, saying, \"We urge the European Parliament to respect China's sovereignty and refrain from undermining China-EU relations by awarding such a prize.\"\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations have praised the European Parliament's decision to honor Wei Jingsheng. Sophie in't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said, \"Wei Jingsheng represents the best of China, the will to resist repression and defend human rights. Awarding him with the Sakharov Prize is an important show of solidarity.\"\nHuman Rights Watch also welcomed the decision, saying, \"The European Parliament has sent a strong message that the world is watching as China continues to crack down on those who seek to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights.\"\nWei Jingsheng, who lives in the United States, expressed his gratitude for the award, saying, \"I hope this award will inspire more people to stand up for their rights and freedoms, and to work towards a democratic future for China.\"\nThe Chinese government's response to the Sakharov Prize for Wei Jingsheng is indicative of its growing hostility to outside criticism and interference. China has faced international criticism for its treatment of ethnic minorities, its suppression of dissent, and its crackdown on civil society.\nThe European Union has been particularly vocal in its condemnation of China's human rights record, with officials calling for an independent investigation into the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and criticising Beijing's new security law in Hong Kong.\nThe awarding of the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jingsheng is a reminder that the international community remains committed to upholding human rights and democracy, despite China's attempts to silence its critics.", "Beijing has offered assurances to Taiwan regarding the island's security following the lift of a direct trade ban. The move, which has been a long-standing issue between the two sides, is expected to boost economic ties but has raised concerns over Taiwan's security.\nChina's State Council announced last week that it would end the ban on direct trade between China and Taiwan. The ban, which was introduced in 2000, had required Taiwan businesses to go through Hong Kong or other third-party countries to trade with China. The ban was seen as a way for Beijing to exert pressure on Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.\nTaiwanese officials had expressed concerns that lifting the ban would make the island more vulnerable to China's influence and coercion. Taiwan has been a self-governing democracy since 1949, but China has been keen to reunify it with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve that goal. Beijing has also stepped up its military activities around Taiwan, including sending fighter jets and aircraft carriers near the island.\nHowever, Chinese officials have sought to allay these fears, saying that the trade agreement would not compromise Taiwan's security. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that the agreement \"will not harm the interests of Taiwanese businesses or workers\" and that \"it will not affect Taiwan's security.\"\nWang also reiterated Beijing's stance on the \"one China\" principle, which states that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part. He said that \"the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair and concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and that \"Taiwan independence is a dead end.\"\nDespite the reassurances from Beijing, many Taiwanese remain skeptical. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that it would \"actively evaluate\" the agreement and would \"take all necessary measures to safeguard the nation's security and interests.\" Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has also said that the island would \"remain steadfast in defending our democracy and freedom\" and would not bow to pressure from Beijing.\nIn the United States, which has long been a supporter of Taiwan's democracy, there are also concerns over the agreement. A State Department spokesman said that the US has \"long been clear that we support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the international community\" and that any steps taken by China to suppress Taiwan's international presence would be met with \"strong opposition.\"\nThe US has also been stepping up its military presence in the region in response to China's increasing assertiveness. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have both visited Japan and South Korea, where they reaffirmed the US commitment to regional security and stressed the importance of the US alliances with those countries.\nThe lift of the direct trade ban between China and Taiwan is a significant development in the relationship between the two sides. While it is expected to boost economic ties, it has also heightened concerns over Taiwan's security and sovereignty. Beijing's assurances may have eased some of those concerns, but many Taiwanese remain wary of China's intentions. As the US and other regional powers continue to monitor the situation, the focus will remain on how the agreement will play out in practice and whether it will lead to greater cooperation or greater tensions between China and Taiwan.", "Two of the UK's insurance broking giants \u2013 Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings and Fenchurch Plc \u2013 have announced plans to merge their operations in an effort to offset declining margins. The merger would create one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the country, with a combined workforce of over 800 people.\nThe decision to merge comes amid growing concerns in the insurance sector about falling margins due to increased competition and regulatory pressures. Firms have been struggling to maintain profitability, as lower premiums and higher claims payouts have squeezed their margins.\n\"To succeed in today's challenging market environment, insurers must find ways to generate higher margins while keeping costs under control,\" said James Maxwell, CEO of Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings. \"By joining forces with Fenchurch Plc, we can leverage our scale and expertise to achieve greater efficiencies and economies of scale.\"\nThe merger is expected to help the firms reduce their operating costs by consolidating their back-office functions and reducing duplicate services. This cost-cutting move is expected to result in significant savings, which will be passed on to clients in the form of lower premiums and better coverage.\nBoth firms have a strong reputation in the insurance industry, with a focus on providing high-quality service to clients across a range of sectors, including property and casualty, healthcare, and financial lines. The merger is expected to strengthen the firms' capabilities in these areas and allow them to offer a wider range of products and services to clients.\n\"The merger of Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings and Fenchurch Plc is a natural fit, as both firms share a commitment to excellence in client service and a focus on innovation and growth,\" said Fiona Stewart, CEO of Fenchurch Plc. \"We believe the combination of our resources, expertise, and best practices will allow us to deliver even better results for our clients.\"\nThe merger is subject to regulatory approval, but both firms expect to complete the process by the end of the year. The new company will be headquartered in London and led by a management team drawn from both firms.\n\"This is an exciting time for our industry, with significant challenges and opportunities ahead,\" said Maxwell. \"By combining the strengths of two leading firms, we believe we can create a powerful force in the insurance market and deliver real value to our clients.\"", "Lloyd's Insurance Market has received a favorable ruling from the U.S. District Court, which has allowed the market to extend its recovery plan deadline.\nThe court ruling comes as welcome news for Lloyd's, which has been working to rebuild its reputation and financial standing after suffering significant losses in recent years. The insurance market had set a target of returning to profitability by 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a wrench into its plans.\nFortunately, the court ruling has allowed for a more flexible timetable for Lloyd's to meet its financial targets. The extension gives the market more time to implement its recovery plan while navigating the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\nLloyd's Chief Executive Officer, John Neal, expressed gratitude for the ruling and noted that the market continues to make progress towards achieving its goals.\n\"We are pleased with the court ruling, which recognizes the progress we have made in implementing our recovery plan,\" Neal said. \"We remain fully committed to returning Lloyd's to profitability and delivering long-term sustainable value to our customers and investors.\"\nThe extension will also give Lloyd's more time to address some of the structural issues that have contributed to its financial struggles. One of the key issues that the market has faced is the high cost of doing business, which has made it hard for Lloyd's to compete with other insurance providers.\nIn response, Lloyd's has launched a number of initiatives aimed at reducing costs, including a plan to streamline its syndicate structure and reduce the number of underwriters it employs. The market has also been exploring new ways to use technology to improve efficiency and make it easier for customers to do business with Lloyd's.\nDespite these challenges, there are signs that Lloyd's is making progress towards its goals. The market has seen improvements in its underwriting performance, and it has been able to attract new investors.\nThe court ruling is likely to provide some much-needed relief for Lloyd's, which has faced significant financial pressure in recent years. The insurance market suffered a loss of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2018, and it has struggled to recover since then.\nThe pandemic has only added to the market's troubles, as it has led to an increase in claims and a decrease in business activity. However, Lloyd's has been proactive in responding to these challenges and has put in place measures to support its customers and partners.\nMoving forward, Lloyd's will continue to focus on implementing its recovery plan, streamlining its business operations, and finding new ways to provide value to its customers. The court ruling is a positive step in the right direction, and it provides the market with the flexibility it needs to navigate the uncertain economic landscape.\nWith a renewed focus on innovation, cost reduction, and customer service, Lloyd's is well-positioned to overcome its challenges and emerge as a stronger and more resilient insurance market.", "Pharmacy chain corporation, Revco Drug Stores Inc. (Revco D.S.), has announced its decision to acquire Big B for $380 million. The move comes as Revco D.S. aims to expand its footprint in the mid-western United States, where Big B has established a considerable presence over the years.\nRevco D.S. has had its fair share of problems in the past, which has affected its financial performance. However, this acquisition marks the corporation's efforts to overcome those difficulties and propel growth in the future. With the purchase of Big B, Revco D.S. stands to gain access to a larger customer base and increase its revenue and profits.\nThe acquisition will give Revco D.S. ownership over Big B's 200 stores across Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, with more than 5,000 employees. The acquisition will also add more than $1 billion in annual sales to Revco's figures. This, in turn, will improve its position in the competitive pharmacy market, where it faces stiff competition from larger chains like CVS and Walgreens.\nSources close to the transaction have said that the deal was inevitable as Big B had been looking for a buyer for some time. Revco D.S. was the natural choice since the corporation already had a presence in the areas that Big B operates in. The two companies' values overlap, with a strong focus on customer service and the provision of quality healthcare. This deal, therefore, is expected to be a seamless and mutually beneficial transition.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Jeff Poore, Revco's CEO, will assume the role of CEO of the combined entity. Poore has expressed his excitement at the opportunity to continue providing healthcare solutions to the communities the combined entity serves.\n\"We are thrilled about the acquisition of Big B and the opportunities it presents for us to grow and continue providing excellent patient care to more communities,\" Poore said. \"Both Revco and Big B share the same commitment to putting our customers first, and this acquisition will enable us to serve more customers and provide them with affordable, quality healthcare services.\"\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed in the next six months, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions.

Despite the ongoing economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the cashmere products manufacturer has managed to grow its business by taking advantage of lower cost inputs.\nAccording to the company's financial statement for the first half of 2021, its revenue rose 28.5% to 4.53 billion yuan ($699 million) compared to the same period last year, while net profit surged 175.6% to 517.5 million yuan ($79.8 million). The company said that the increase was mainly due to the decline in the cost of raw materials such as cashmere, wool, and camel hair.\nInner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd is a leading Chinese maker of cashmere fabrics, garments, and accessories, supplying major brands such as Burberry, Armani, and Max Mara. The company sources its raw materials from Inner Mongolia, where the world's best cashmere is produced. However, the cost of cashmere has been declining for several years due to oversupply and weak consumer demand.\nThe pandemic has worsened the situation, with the global fashion industry suffering a severe downturn as people have reduced their spending on non-essential items. This has forced cashmere farmers to sell their products at lower prices, which has benefited manufacturers like Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd.\nThe company has also focused on reducing production costs and increasing efficiency, which has helped it to maintain profitability even in difficult market conditions. It has invested in new technologies and processes to streamline operations and improve the quality of its products.\nIn addition, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd has expanded its product lines and marketing channels to reach more customers. It has launched new collections of cashmere clothes and accessories, targeting younger and fashion-conscious consumers. It has also increased its online sales and social media presence, which has helped it to reach a wider audience.\nThe company expects to continue its growth trajectory in the second half of 2021, as demand for cashmere products is expected to recover as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. However, it cautioned that the volatility of raw material prices could affect its financial performance in the future.\nOverall, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd's strong interim results demonstrate its resilience and adaptability in a challenging business environment. Its ability to take advantage of market opportunities and innovate its business model could serve as a model for other companies struggling in the current economic climate.", "Washington D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Tuesday that it is erasing a Depression-era rule that governed the rates that long-distance phone companies could charge each other. The decision is part of the agency\u2019s efforts to modernize regulations and provide a more conducive environment for competition.\nThe rule, which was put in place in 1934, required long-distance phone companies to charge each other the same rate for using each other\u2019s networks. Advocates for the rule argued that it prevented larger companies from using their market dominance to cut off competition by charging higher rates to independent carriers or simply refusing to connect their networks to those of potential competitors. But critics of the rule, including many in the telecom industry, argued that it created distortions in the market and discouraged innovation.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the rule is likely to provoke both criticism and praise from different quarters. Supporters of the measure say that it will clear the way for more innovation in the telecom industry and allow newer, smaller companies to gain a foothold. They also argue that the move will help bring down prices for consumers and businesses.\nOne telecom industry insider praised the decision, arguing that \u201cthe telecom industry has changed dramatically since the 1930s, and it\u2019s beyond time for regulations to catch up with that reality.\u201d But others have criticized the FCC for effectively deregulating the long-distance phone market. Critics argue that without the rule, larger companies will be able to charge smaller ones higher rates, which could carve some smaller players out of the market altogether.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision is part of a broader effort to reduce regulation and red tape in the telecommunications industry. Last year, the agency repealed net neutrality rules that would have required internet service providers to treat all online traffic equally. Supporters of that decision argued that it allowed ISPs to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs, while critics argued that it would lead to bigger companies dominating the market and stifling competition.\nThe FCC has also been working to streamline the approval process for telecom companies, making it easier for them to build new infrastructure and deploy new services. Last year, the agency created a \u201cone-touch make-ready\u201d policy, which allows new telecom companies to more easily attach their equipment to existing poles and other infrastructure.\nThe telecom industry has been changing rapidly over the past decade, with new technologies and services emerging at a rapid pace. As a result, policymakers and regulators have been struggling to keep up with developments in the field. The FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the long-distance phone rate rule is just one example of how the agency is attempting to modernize regulations and adapt to the new realities of the market.", "Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is considering a small cut in cocoa freight rates for the 1996/97 shipping season. This move is set to cushion local exporters from rising costs, and to make the country's cocoa more competitive on the international market.\nIvory Coast's cocoa freight rates, which are set by the government, are among the highest in the world, costing shippers up to $80 per tonne. This has led to complaints from local exporters who say that high rates are making it difficult to compete with other cocoa exporting countries. Keeping these rates unchanged could also mean a significant loss in revenue for the country.\nAccording to industry sources, the proposed cut would see freight rates fall to between $70 and $75 per tonne for the 1996/97 shipping season, down from the current rate of $80. It is believed that the decision to cut rates was influenced by a recent drop in global cocoa prices, which has led to concerns about the country's cocoa exports.\nThis move comes as cocoa prices have hit a five-year low. In September, cocoa futures fell to $1,946 per tonne in London, its lowest level since late 2013. This has led to a number of concerns in the cocoa-producing regions of West Africa, with many farmers struggling to make a living. Lower cocoa freight rates could help to alleviate some of these concerns by increasing the competitiveness of Ivorian cocoa on the global market.\nIvory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for over 40% of world supply. The country's cocoa is highly sought after for its quality and flavour, making it a valuable commodity on the international market. However, the high cost of shipping has made it difficult for local exporters to compete with other countries such as Ghana, which has lower shipping costs.\nThe proposed cut in cocoa freight rates has been welcomed by local exporters, who say that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the international market. It is also seen as a way to increase revenue for the country, which relies heavily on cocoa exports for its economic growth.\n\"We welcome this decision by the government to cut cocoa freight rates,\" said a spokesperson for the Ivorian Cocoa Association. \"This will help to make our cocoa more competitive on the international market, and will benefit both local exporters and the country as a whole.\"\nHowever, there are concerns that the proposed cut may not be enough to make a significant impact on the country's cocoa exports. Some experts argue that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues affecting the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast, such as poor infrastructure and low productivity levels.\n\"There is no doubt that lower cocoa freight rates will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive,\" said Samir Nasr, a commodity analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. \"But there are other issues that need to be addressed in order to really boost the country's cocoa exports. These include improving transport infrastructure, increasing productivity levels, and ensuring that farmers are getting a fair price for their cocoa.\"\nDespite these concerns, the proposed cut in cocoa freight rates is seen as a positive step for Ivory Coast's cocoa industry. It is hoped that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the global market and increase revenue for the country."]}
