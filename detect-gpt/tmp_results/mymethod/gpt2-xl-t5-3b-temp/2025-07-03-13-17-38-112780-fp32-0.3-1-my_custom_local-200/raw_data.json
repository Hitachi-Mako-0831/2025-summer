{"original": ["Royal Oak Mines Inc is reshaping its operations to concentrate on its low-cost gold deposits in the Timmins area and British Columbia, the company president said Wednesday.\n\"We have refocused our strategy to bring on very low-cost production,\" Peggy Witte said in an analysts' conference call. \"It's very clear that's where Royal Oak's future lies.\"  \nThe Kirkland, Washington-based gold producer said Wednesday it will close down its mine in Hope Brook, Newfoundland, and write down the reserves at its Colomac mine in the Northwest Territories.\nRoyal Oak expects to take C$37.4 million in charges because of the Hope Brook and Colomac decisions. After tax, the charges will amount to a decrease in net income of about C$27 million or C$0.19 a share in the fourth quarter of 1996.\nThe company plans to move most of the mining and mill assets from Hope Brook to its Matachewan project in northern Ontario.  \n\"It's a very positive story for us being able to redeploy those assets, and we did not want to spread our senior management too thin,\" Witte said, explaining the decision.\nHope Brook will shut down in the third quarter of 1997, while Matachewan is expected to start production in the second half of 1998, Royal Oak said.\nThe company recently increased its gold reserves at its Timmins and Matachewan properties, decided to expand its Pamour Mill and is putting together a feasibility study for an expanded open pit in the area.  \nThe northern Ontario mines, along with production expected in 1998 from the Kemess copper and gold mine in British Columbia, will boost production and decrease costs significantly for Royal Oak, said chief financial officer Jim Wood.\nThe company expects to produce 375,000 ounces at a cash costs of US$325 an ounce in 1997. In 1998, production will rise to 500,000 ounces at a cost of US$250 or US$260 an ounce. By 1999, the company expects up to 750,000 ounces at about US$240 an ounce, and in 2000, production should be almost one million ounces with costs in the low US$200s, Wood said.  \n\"Although we have closed out Hope Brook cash costs are somewhat disappointing at Colomac, the future of the company, with the Pamour expansion, looks very bright for us in terms of production and our average cash costs,\" he said.\nThe company reported third quarter profits of C$10.2 million or C$0.07 a share, up from C$6.2 million or C$0.05 a share a year earlier.\nGold production rose 13 percent in the quarter to 104,012 ounces from 92,159 ounces during the third quarter last year.\nThe increase came from the Pamour mine in Northern Ontario, which produced higher grade ore.  \nRevenue was 48 percent higher in the third quarter, mainly because of a successful hedging program. The company realized a gold price of US$543 per ounce, compared to US$418 an ounce at the same time last year.\nRoyal Oak expects to produce about 400,000 ounces of gold in 1996 at a cash cost of US$335 an ounce. The lower production level and increase in cash cost from previous estimates are a result of lower grade ore at Colomac.", "Fast-growing Republic Industries Inc., which is led by Florida entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga, said Thursday it would buy Alamo-Rent-A-Car Inc. for $625 million in a move to sharply expand its automobile business.\nThe deal comes less than six weeks after the collapse of Huizenga's $4.3 billion plan to buy security firm ADT Ltd.\n\"Leisure travel is a fast growing segment of the automobile rental industry and Alamo's innovative leadership in this growth sector of the automobile rental marketplace is consistent with our strategy of building consumer-oriented, service related businesses with recognised brand names and strong management,\" Huizenga said in a statement.\nRepublic is expected to use Alamo to expand its burgeoning auto business rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.\nHuizenga \"wants to be the largest used-car sales, leasing and rental provider. It makes sense to have the Alamo fleet as a warehouse for his vehicles,\" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.\nAlamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.\nAlamo founder and Chairman Michael Egan, who owns about 94 percent of the company, will continue as chairman of Alamo.\nHuizenga said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.\n\"The combination of Alamo with Republic's'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system,\" he said.\nRepublic bought used-car company AutoNation earlier this year and opened its first superstore about two weeks ago in Florida. It plans to open three or four more AutoNation stores this year and quickly expand the chain so there are some 80 stores around the nation by the end of the decade.\nAutoNation will be supplemented by Republic's recent $95 million purchase of used-car superstore firm CarChoice Inc.\nInvestors praised the latest acquisition by Republic, bidding the company's stock up $2.875 to $33.625 on Nasdaq. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.\nIn addition to the automotive industry, Republic specialises in electronic security and solid waste companies. Huizenga also owns the professional Florida Marlins baseball, Panthers hockey and Dolphins football teams.\nHuizenga suffered a setback in late September when his plan to buy security firm ADT was called off after weeks of uncertainty. Although the stock deal was viewed positively from a strategic standpoint, it fell apart due to volatility in Republic's stock and the inability of the companies to revise terms of the transaction.\nAnalysts saw little chance of that happening with Alamo.\n\"I think Alamo provides Republic everything that ADT did, plus more, from the auto side,\" said Jordan Hymowitz of Montgomery Securities, who rates Republic shares as a buy.\nRepublic also said it will pursue more car deals.\n\"We're interested in growing in virtually every segment of the automobile industry,\" spokesman Ronald Castell said, citing rental, used cars, repairs and financing.\nThe acquisition of Alamo marks the latest in a flurry of transactions in the rental car industry.\nOn Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.\nLast month, hotel and real estate operator HFS Inc. bought Avis Inc., the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. HFS has said it will pursue another similar acquisition and launch an initial public offering for part of its rental car subsidiary next year.\nFord Motor Co., which owns Hertz, in July announced it was expanding its rental car business with the acquisition of Budget Rent-a-Car. Ford already had owned part of Budget.\nMeanwhile, Chrysler Corp. wants to sell subsidiaries Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car.", "For 36 years Tibet's biggest leather factory gushed pollution into one of the world's cleanest rivers and haemorrhaged losses.\nBut help was at hand when Tibet's scenic beauty and devout Buddhist people enchanted visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1988.\nGerman aid has since poured in, along with German technicians, transforming the plant into a rare model of environmental awareness on the roof of the world. It has also made its first net profit.\nManager Li Jishan glowed with pride as he described the modernisation wrought at his plant over the last few years.\n\"When I first came here in 1961 things were really backward. We lived in tents. Can you imagine?\" he said in an interview with Reuters.\nThe leather factory was moved to Lhasa in 1959 from Golmud in neighbouring Qinghai province to provide footleather for thousands of soldiers sent to garrison Tibet after an abortive uprising by Tibetans seeking independence in 1958.\nAs a state-owned firm that processes yak skins into shoes and handbags it had little incentive to turn a profit. That is slowly changing.\nLast year, the China-Germany Joint Venture Lhasa Leather Factory of Tibet reported a profit of 200,000 yuan ($24,000) -- a modest sum but the first in its history.\n\"We have a good future, our efficiency is good...and with German assistance we are placing great emphasis on environmental protection,\" said Li, adding that he expected another profit this year.\n\"The German side is very strict, especially on environmental protection,\" he noted. \"But we get along with them very well.\"\nOne problem identified by the German side is one common to most of China's state-owned firms -- the huge surplus labour that is the legacy of jobs-for-life socialism.\n\"We have had arguments with the German experts who want to fire someone, for example,\" said Li. \"But they have come to understand our point of view and our system.\"\nHowever, German officials still warn that keeping on a couple of hundred extra staff is bound to affect profits.\nGerman officials said the plant had been an environmental disaster when they arrived, with its tannery spouting stinking waste into the nearby rushing Tolungchu river.\n\"It was in really bad shape with terrible environmental problems,\" said Niels von Keyserlingk, director of the office of the German Development Corporation in Beijing that oversees aid to the plant.\n\"Before, the water was untreated and flowed into the river causing many problems,\" he said. \"But things have been very nicely done. There is no pollution.\"\nAll chemicals are recycled now and a German-manufactured system cleans the water, separating waste that is dried for use by local farmers as fertiliser.\n\"The water that flows into the river is absolutely clean,\" said von Keyserlingk, who visited the plant last May.\nA cement factory on the opposite bank belching dust into the clear mountain area could pose a new environmental hazard.\nGermany has given 15 million deutschemarks ($9.8 million) in aid to the plant, which has been allowed to register as a joint venture and thus qualifies for the generous tax breaks and holidays that Tibet offers to foreign investors.\nGerman money has helped to buy the latest in leather processing machinery as well as sewing machines, waste elimination plants and even new solar energy panels that are heating water for the factory.\nSales have soared. The factory held an eight percent share of the Tibet shoe market for years, but in 1994 that jumped to 20 percent and nearly doubled again in 1995 to a 36 percent market share.\n\"Our products are really popular because they are all leather, and people want that kind of quality,\" Li said.\nThe factory is trying to boost sales to the rest of China as well as overseas exports, particularly to neighbouring Nepal.\nBut it faces awesome transport handicaps in shipping goods from a city that has no rail links and must send merchandise more than 1,000 km (600 miles) over some of China's most difficult roads to the nearest railway station.\n\"We still need to raise quality and produce more different styles of shoes to compete in the market,\" said Li, who has clearly picked up some tips from his German market-savvy experts.\n\"Either you learn to swim in the market or you drown.\"", "Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.\nThe troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.\nApple's loss, which equalled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.\nBased on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programmes during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.\nPreviously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.\n\"While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,\" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. \"We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.\n\"Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales,\" he said. \"We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter.\"\nNevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996.\n\"Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September,\" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.", "China said on Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.\nBeijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.\n\"We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,\" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters.\n\"The two sides will exchange views,\" he said.\nBeijing said on Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.\nThe temporary import ban would take effect on December 10.\nIn September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.\nChina said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.\n\"We are still seeking the views of Chinese enteprises about which products should be included under the ban,\" the Chinese official said.\n\"That will be determined in another 30 days.\"\nThe total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.\nBut China's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.\nRelations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.\nChina and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.\nThe two sides are preparing for high level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.\nChristopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.", "The largest electricity provider in the United States marched into Asia on Thursday with a US$2.7 billion deal to buy independent Hong Kong power producer, Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd.\nAtlanta-based Southern Co said it made a general offer to all CEPA's shareholders after agreeing to buy most of a 60.4-percent stake held by CEPA parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd.  \n\"The plan is to use this company as our growth vehicle in Asia,\" Ray Harris, regional director of Southern Electric International Inc, a unit of the Southern Co, told a news conference in the British colony.\n\"We think we paid a fair price and we see it as completing our geographical diversification from the United States,\" he said.\nHopewell said Southern aims to acquire 80 percent of CEPA's shares through a straightforward cash deal of HK$18.50 per share, or a cash and stock offer, he said.  \nHopewell has already agreed to tender 80 percent of its stake under an alternative cash and stock option, which offers one new CEPA share, cash of HK$69.50 and a contingency payment of HK$8.00 for every five CEPA shares.\nThe contingency payment depends on the company managing to secure a limited recourse debt for a power plant in Indonesia.\nHopewell will retain between 12.1 percent and 20 percent of the new company depending on which option shareholders choose.  \nSouthern's planned acquisition of 80 percent of CEPA's shares will effectively privatise the company, reducing its public float below Hong Kong stock exchange requirements and requiring it to de-list.\nShareholders, banks and regulators must still approve the deal, with shareholder meetings slated for November. Closing is expected before the end of the year.\nBoth Southern and CEPA said the takeover complements each other's strengths, with Southern renowned for its operating ability and CEPA one of the first to exploit Asia's quickening thirst for power.  \n\"This is, we felt, a very, very good marriage,\" said Stewart Elliott, CEPA's chief executive officer and managing director. \"If we're going to see Asian growth as everyone has predicted, a massive amount of power is required.\"\nFounded in 1993 as a holding company for Hopewell's power assets, CEPA owns some of southern China's largest power plants.\nIts flagship Shajiao B project in Guangdong province was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$4.1 billion followed by the 1994 start-up of the US$1.87 billion Shajiao C power station.  \nCEPA also owns substantial assets in the Philippines, and said it is negotiating to build more generating plants in southern China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.\nHarris said Southern was committed to pursuing all CEPA's existing plans, which he hopes will be augmented by Southern's expertise and financial muscle.\n\"We are very optimistic about the future.... We would hope we would have some announcements in relation to new power plants (in the next six to 12 months),\" Harris said.\nElliott and Gordon Wu, CEPA's executive chairman and the founder of Hopewell, will remain in place, he said.", "Gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. is negotiating with Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the two companies said on Tuesday.\nThe companies were negotiating under the \"guidance\" of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world's biggest gold deposits, in 1994.\nOfficial estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.\n\"This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X's sale process,\" one analyst said of the news. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.\nTo satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer.\nBre-X said that the Indonesian government \"would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.\"\nThe Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by December 4 or else the government \"will take steps to prevent a delay in the development\" of Busang, Bre-X said.\nDevelopment of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery.\nBre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia's Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.\nA deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview.\nHe said he had no details about how much money or stock would change hands or when a deal would be reached.\nWith the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X's powers to negotiate a favorable deal were curbed, analysts said.\n\"There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X,\" said mining analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. \"That's going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest.\"\nBut Barrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen to treat Bre-X fairly, analysts said.\n\"Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward,\" said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.\nBarrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.30 to C$38.85 by mid-afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose 2-1/4 to 29-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady in active trading at C$20.10, down C$2.45, after the market digested the news.\nIts stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.\nBusang would set Barrick well on its way to achieving its dream of becoming the world's biggest gold company.\nIn 1995, the company -- already North America's largest -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totaling 43.3 million ounces.\nIt has become increasingly aggressive in moving towards its goal, analysts said.\nLast summer, Barrick acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. and its promising Pierina gold property in Peru for about $800 million.", "Lloyds Bank was fined 325,000 pounds ($550,000) Wednesday by a British investment industry watchdog and appears set to pay millions of pounds in compensation to disadvantaged customers.\nThe Investment Management Regulatory Organisation said it fined Lloyds, which merged with TSB last year to form Lloyds TSB Group Plc, for breaches of rules relating to its pensions transfer business between April 1988 and June 1993.\nLloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it, the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products.\nIMRO said Lloyds \"did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers.\"\nIt said Lloyds had not provided certain customers \"with all the information needed to enable them to make a balanced and informed decision on whether to carry out a pension transfer.\"\nLloyds, which must pay IMRO's investigation costs of 63,000 pounds ($107,000) and make a contribution to its disciplinary costs, has already offered redress to some customers and the review of some 2,600 Lloyds transfer cases \"is well advanced and will be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 1997,\" IMRO added.\nThe bank expressed its regret in a statement.\n\"Lloyds Bank deeply regrets the errors which have resulted in charges being brought against it by IMRO for its pension transfer business,\" it said.\nAs a group, Lloyds TSB has made provisions totalling 165 million pounds ($279 million) for possible compensation payments to do with the mis-selling of pension products.\nThese relate to the Lloyds Bank business as well as the pensions activities of TSB before the merger, and of Lloyds' insurance subsidiary Lloyds Abbey Life.\nThe pension scandal, whereby individuals transferred their pensions and were disadvantaged as a result, has been one of the most serious faced by the British financial services industry in recent years.\nThe affair knocked a big hole in the public's confidence in the industry and companies are set to pay a price running into hundreds of million of pounds as a result.\nIn November, Britain's top financial markets regulator the Securities and Investments Board announced a new strategy to try and clear a logjam in the pensions industry's review of the selling of pension products and the payment of compensation to investors.\nBoth regulators and insurance and investment companies have come under a barrage of criticism over the length of time it has taken to complete a review of cases.\nLloyds said it has identified some 2,600 pension transfer customers of which it anticipates having to pay compensation to around 1,500.", "Dairy and fruit juice group National Foods Ltd said on Tuesday its reforms announced in July were now almost fully completed and the group was poised for above-budget profit growth in the next six to nine months.\n\"It's almost fully implemented,\" outgoing National Foods managing director Graham Reaney told Reuters in an interview.\n\"The real benefits start to emerge as people become more familiar with the new structures and clearly there'll be gains over the next six to nine months,\" Reaney said.  \nEarlier on Tuesday National Foods posted a 17.3 percent higher operating profit before tax of A$37.6 million for the year to June 30.\nIts net profit rose to A$15.05 million from A$10.77 million after an abnormal loss of A$7.89 million.\nNet profit before abnormals rose to A$22.7 million from A$19.2 million, against analysts' expectations of about A$23 million.\nNational Foods said in announcing its results, earnings for July and August were ahead of budget and comfortably ahead of last year.  \nReaney repeated that this meant that 1996/97 profits were likely to be higher than in 1995/96, but he would not say how much higher. \"But its clearly going in the right direction.\"\nThe reforms had created a more efficient distribution system for chilled foods, increasing sales coverage for National Foods' products, Reaney said.\n\"It's a combination of cost reduction and enhanced distribution, and looking at our beverage division, our flavoured milks are performing particularly strongly,\" he said.\n\"There are a number of areas that starting to perform a lot better for us.\"  \nReaney said the sale of non-core assets had also been completed and the company was now focused on extracting profit growth from existing assets.\n\"We would consider all businesses that we have today as core businesses,\" he said, adding, however, that he could not rule out future acquisitions.\n\"But the first objective to make those assets that we currently own work better, produce more profit, more cash flow.\"\nSingapore's Camerlin Pte Ltd has about eight percent of National Foods and Hong Kong's Mingly Corp has about 10.4 percent of the company.  \nReaney said he would not comment on shareholders' intentions or actions or whether either of the Asian-based investors planned any takeover or had brought on any board room reshuffle.\nHe said he had resigned the managing director's position having worked for the company for five years. \"Five to seven years is a normal period for a chief executive and quite genuinely I do have other things to do,\" he said.\n\"I'm quite relaxed and if it wasn't an amicable arrangement I wouldn't be staying on as a non-executive director,\" he said on his last day in the job.  \nReaney's replacement, Max Ould, was

This would be the basis for continuing the company's progressive dividend policy.\nThe news boosted Britannic shares, which jumped 71 pence, or nearly nine percent, at one stage before settling for a rise of 29 pence at 832.5.\nThe money attributable to shareholders forms part of total assets in the life funds which amounted to 5.682 billion pounds at the end of 1995.\nThose assets were estimated to have risen by the end of 1996, Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw said, and updated figures would be released on March 18.\nBritannic also announced a restructuring of its long-term funds and the results of a strategic review of its business.\nThe review will lead to new sales management and premium collection systems, streamlining of head office and investment in market analysis and product research.\nThe initiatives are expected to cut operating costs by around 25 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.\nBritannic said it planned to build on its brand, investment management and distribution skills, financial strength and product development abilities to strengthen its position and improve value to policy and shareholders.\nRestructuring the long-term fund will create two continuing \"with profits\" funds, one for its industrial branch and the other for the ordinary branch -- life and pensions business.\nIn future at least 90 percent of the surplus in the with profits funds will be allocated each year to with profits policies. The balance will be shareholders' profit for transfer to the profit and loss account.\nThe company has also created two separate non-profit sub funds -- one for life, one for pensions -- which will contain non-profits business and both of which will be owned by shareholders.\nThe shareholder transfer for 1996 will be increased by 23 million pounds following the declaration of the 209 million pound special bonus. ($ = 0.621 British Pounds)", "The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service.\nThe total was down 75 percent from a similar Federal Communications Commission auction that raised $10.2 billion last May. The average price for a license to provide \"personal communications services,\" or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.\nPCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.\nThe drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.\nThe top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities.\nNext was a unit of long-distance giant AT&T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses.\nThe No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.\nThe FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.\nBased on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.\nThat was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's \"C-Block\" sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.\nThe FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.\n\"It's phenomenally cheaper,\" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.\nMark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices \"more reflective of the current market reality.\"\nAnalysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.\nThe airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.\nAnalysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.\n\"The market is going to be too crowded,\" predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.\nThe steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. \"The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,\" said Bane.\nIn addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.", "General Motors Corp. workers remained on the job without a contract Monday as United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich refrained -- for now -- from calling a strike against the auto giant.\nNegotiations on a new national labor contract covering GM's 215,000 UAW hourly workers recessed early Monday after a midnight strike deadline passed. Yokich said some bargainers would resume talks later in the day.\n\"The only place you can settle these agreements is at the bargaining table,\" Yokich told a news conference early Monday. \"We feel that with or without a contract in place, we can continue (working). It's open-ended.\"\nThe union plans to bring its plant-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting on the talks on Saturday, a move that typically comes after a tentative agreement is reached.\nAlthough Yokich played down the threat of a strike on Monday, he said some of the more than 100 local unions at GM plants may resort to walkouts unless the automaker meets union demands in separate negtiations for local labor agreements.\nThe local talks have become a sticking point for the national negotiations, Yokich said, because only a few of the locals have signed agreements with GM.\nThe local pacts typically cover plant-specific issues such as work rules and health and safety standards, while the national contract covers wages, benefits, job security and other common issues.\n\"We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,\" Yokich said, declining to identify specific plants or issues.\nNevertheless, he urged anxious UAW members who watched their Canadian counterparts strike for three weeks this month to stay on the job for the time being.\n\"We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,\" he said.\nNegotiations at GM's headquarters building here continued for 17 hours until about 2 a.m. EST on Monday, when bargainers began leaving, carrying their overnight bags.\nAlthough some talks were scheduled to resume Monday afternoon, Yokich and other top UAW officers do not plan to return to the bargaining table until Tuesday morning.\nIn a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.\n\"We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,\" Knechtel said.\nYokich chided GM's hard-headed negotiating style as \"typical GM,\" and noted that the union has consistently had a better relationship with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.\nThe UAW wants GM to agree to the same job guarantees granted by Ford and Chrysler, which call for the two companies to guarantee employment for 95 percent of their combined 171,000 UAW members in the United States.\nGM has 12 North American parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee pledges, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.\nAlthough GM is viewed as the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich insisted that the auto giant can live with the pattern.\n\"I think Ford and Chrysler understood when we said we're preparing ourselves and our union to enter the 21st Century with you as partners in the corporation,\" he said. \"I'm not too sure GM understands that. They've always been late bloomers. Maybe they'll get the message sooner or later.\"\nThe UAW's strike threat comes less than a week after GM settled a 20-day strike by the independent Canadian Auto Workers union. The CAW struck over many of the same issues -- job security and shifting jobs to outside suppliers.\nUAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the U.S. union did not feel pressure to get the exact same provisions that GM agreed to in Canada.\nGM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.\nThe National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.\nThe league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.\nThe site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.\n\"Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,\" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch \"has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.\"\nIn May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.\nFraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.\nThe second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.\nIn third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.\nOther top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.\nThe League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.", "Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.\nSynopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.\nShares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.\nSynopsys specializes in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specializes in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.\nThe acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.\n\"We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,\" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston. \"Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing\" the tiny \"deep submicron\" circuits.\nSynopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.\nEpic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.\nSynopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, \"ideally March,\" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.", "The British government on Wednesday published proposed new laws governing home lenders which watered down the building societies' immunity from takeover if they converted into banks.\nThe new legislation provoked a cool response from some home lenders and prompted one leading player to say its plans for conversion may well have been different if it had known what the government was planning.\nUnder the new draft law, a building society  would forfeit its five-year immunity from takeover after it converted to bank status if it took over another financial institution.\nThe Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($50 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government had not taken account of its \"serious concerns\" on the timing of the draft.\n\"Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,\" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.\nThe Treasury acknowledged the new Building Societies Bill might not even make it to the statute book before an election because of a lack of parliamentary time between now and next May, the last date for the polls to be called.\nIf it went ahead, the Woolwich spokeswoman said the board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.\nThe Alliance & Leicester in a statement also expressed disappointment, and said areas of concern \"have still not been fully resolved.\"\n\"We will now need to move forward while carefully considering outstanding issues,\" the Alliance statement said, noting the move came in the middle of \"a long and costly conversion process\".\nIn contrast the Northern Rock, a third society which plans a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.\n\"We are delighted with it,\" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. \"It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you can't ask for more than that.\"\nA Treasury spokeswoman said it still hoped to find time for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda in the New Year.\n\"The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,\" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. \"When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Building Societies Association welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.", "Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has been ordered to serve three years in a labour camp in a term imposed just hours after police detained him and a second pro-democracy activist was missing, relatives said on Wednesday.\nVeteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe, who recently issued a joint statement with Liu, appeared to be missing from his home in southern Guangzhou, his wife said by telephone.\nPolice had notified Liu Xiaobo's wife early on Wednesday of the administrative three-year sentence, which does not need a court trial, but gave her no reason for the punishment.\n\"They have still had no formal contact with me or given me a reason,\" Liu Xia said in a telephone interview late in the day.\n\"I am very angry. How can they do this?,\" she said. \"He did not do anything illegal. All he did was exercise his freedom of speech.... Citizens have freedom of speech...\"\nShe said she had not yet decided whether to appeal on his behalf.\nThe administrative punishment was passed against Liu just hours after he was taken from his Beijing home early on Tuesday by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police, with a search warrant, who also confiscated books, papers and photographs.\n\"Re-education through labour is the personal power of the public security bureau, it doesn't have to go through judicial departments,\" Liu Xia said. \"The public security can just do as they wish.\"\nPolice officials declined to comment.\nThe administrative punishment of re-education through labour has been increasingly used against dissidents in recent months as a means of removing activists from circulation while avoiding the more complicated trial process, diplomats say.\nPolice gave no reason for the detention of Liu, a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident in the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.\nLiu has been active in recent months, sending several daring, open letters to the government.\nOn September 30, Liu and Wang issued a statement urging China's communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations.\nIn a bold move, the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted, impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the \"absolute leadership\" of the party instead of the state.\nWang did not return home on Tuesday and his wife said she was very worried because he had not responded to his pager.\nWang was paroled in 1993 after serving 12 years of a 14-year term for sedition and remains deprived of his political rights. He is one of China's most outspoken proponents of democracy.\nLiu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year. He was held for seven months without charges until being released in January.\nHis sentence comes shortly after Chinese sources said dissident and former student leader Wang Dan faced a second jail term after prosecutors charged him recently with subversion.\nWang, 26, faces up to seven years in jail on charges of counter-revolutionary incitement -- or subversion.\nWang, who is believed to have worked with Liu on several daring petitions, was detained in May, 1995 in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the June 1989 military crackdown.", "Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said on Monday.\nThe share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.\nRumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.\nWhile the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.\n\"The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,\" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.\n\"Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,\" he added.\nBeijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.\n\"The action has cooled speculative activity for now,\" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. \"But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.\"\nIn the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called \"rubbish shares\" which have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.\n\"Retail investors have turned more to blue-chip shares,\" said a trader. \"Their prices have been stable despite the crackdown.\"\nAnalysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.\nOne key problem of the Chinese share markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.\n\"With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,\" said one stock analyst.\nThe draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon partly due to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.\nResponsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.\nShanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.\nIn Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.", "Shares in Premier Farnell dipped on Monday after the newly enlarged electronic components distributor posted half-year profits slightly below expectations.\nPremier Farnell was created in April when Britain's Farnell Electronics completed a $2.8 billion takeover of America's Premier Industrial Corp -- a company twice its size.\nPre-tax profit for the six months to July 28 totalled 56.1 million pounds ($88.4 million). That was down on the pre-tax figure of 71.3 million pounds a year earlier but that had been flattered by a large one-off gain.\nMore pertinently, analysts had forecast profit in a range of 57.5 to 61.6 million pounds and the failure to reach that level was reflected in a 10.5p decline in the share price to 670p.\nThe company said that the market for electronic components has shown much lower levels of growth in 1996 than in recent years and added it did not expect any major change in conditions for the rest of the year.\n\"I think the evidence is we've bottomed the cycle and the signs at the moment are positive. But we are planning on a more conservative basis at this moment in time,\" chief executive Howard Poulson told Reuters.\nPremier said its priorities were the development and international expansion of the catalogue business and further exploitation of synergies between its transatlantic operations.\nPoulson said he was delighted with progress on integration following an acquisition which had transformed the company, based in the northern English town of Wetherby, into the third largest electronic components distributor in the world.\n\"The integration is going superbly..I am very pleased with what people have done on both sides of the Atlantic,\" he said.\nHe said he did not see any further scope for cutting costs following the acquisition.\n\"I think we've finished with all of the cost-cutting. This was never a deal which was built on reducing overheads and getting rid of people,\" he said.\n\"We said we would remove duplication in our two head offices -- we've done that, we've probably dropped about 150 people since we made the acquisition.\" The company now has some 6,500 staff, 4,000 of whom are in the United States.\n\"What the business is about now is building sales and building our profits that way,\" he added.\nPremier Farnell said its sales expansion projects were on schedule and should begin to make a contribution in the fourth quarter of the year. REUTER", "H&R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.\nH&R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.\nKansas City-based H&R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.\nH&R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.\nBut plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.\nJust nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&R Block's staid tax business.\nNow they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&R Block's performance.\n\"The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&R Block's valuation,\" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.\n\"How quickly things change,\" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. \"What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.\"\nAnalysts said H&R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.\nH&R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.\n\"Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,\" said Frank Salizzoni, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman.\n\"In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe.\"\nBoth Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.\nThe company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.\n\"This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,\" Salizzoni said.\n\"They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,\" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.\nH&R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq.", "As the world's first Internet bank, Atlanta-based Security First Network Bank has had somewhat of an identity problem with potential customers.\n\"We get a lot of questions,\" Chief Executive Officer James Mahan III said. \"Are you real? Are you virtual? Where are you really?\"\nPart consumer bank, part software testing site, Security First opened its virtual doors a year ago this month.\nBut now Security First plans to add actual doors, opening small offices in Atlanta, Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley in California.\n\"I think we can more effectively market if we have a physical presence,\" Mahan said in an interview.\nComparing his bank to discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co., Mahan said having the offices may give customers a sense of security, even if they never use an office.\nSecurity First's current location is on the Internet. The bank is one of five in the United States that operates directly on the Internet, according to the Bank Administration Institute.\nFederally insured Security First can be accessed at Website (www.sfnb.com), which brings consumers to a home page that looks like a bank lobby.\nCustomers can reach their account anywhere they have access to the Internet, rather than being tied to a single terminal where they have finance software, like other computer banks.\n\"Our goal was to have a bank that was fully interactive, where an individual could see all his information,\" Mahan said.\nMost Security First customers have a money market account and a demand deposit account. Customers can open a checking account with as little as $100, an amount most choose to start to make sure the bank works, Mahan said.\nCustomers can pay bills electronically, purchase certificates of deposits or acquire a Visa card. Security First is also hoping to offer brokerage products and first and second mortgage products by the end of the year. Funds can be accessed by automatic teller machine, and Security First absorbs interbank fees for using the machines.\nWith limited infrastructure, Security First can offer higher yields, Mahan said. The bank was offering a six-month CD with an annaul percentage yield of 5.9 percent.\nSecurity First was spawned as an idea of Mahan, who was chief executive officer at Kentucky-based Cardinal Bancshares Inc., and his sister-in-law's husband, Michael McChesney, who was starting a security software firm.\n\"He educated me on the Internet for years and years and years,\" Mahan said. Mahan used the charter of one of Cardinal's thrifts, changed its name to Security First and used it to start the Internet bank.\nMcChesney's, firm, SecureWare Inc. developed software that Mahan said has military-grade security. So far, the bank has not had its security breached, Mahan said.\n\"That doesn't mean that there haven't been a number of sophisticated attempts,\" he said. \"If you have enough money and enough time you can break into anything.\"\nOutsiders agree that Security First has shown a record of being secure, avoiding viruses, data theft and other potential dangers of Internet commerce.\n\"They do use a level of security that the Pentagon reserves for its most secure and sensistive systems,\" said Paul Schmeltzer, executive vice president for network services at Southeast Switch Inc., the corporate organisation for the Honour Network, the fourth largest ATM network in the country. \"Is any security design totally foolproof or totally secure? Probably not.\"\nThat software and others developed for the bank is likely to be the prime money maker for Security First. Mahan admits that Five Paces Inc., Security First's software unit, will be the prime contributor to the company's net income.\n\"The bank is really a test site to use as a demonstration for potential customers of the software business,\" said Gary Craft, an analyst who follows the bank for Alexandria, Va..-based Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.\nSecurity First's stock is traded on Nasdaq.\nSecurity First has opened about 5,600 accounts. Most of its customers are male, between the ages of 25 and 45, with average income above $63,000 a year. More than 80 percent own their own home, attractive demographics for marketing.\nSecurity First has also attracted competition. This month, Atlanta Internet Bank opened for business.\nUnlike Security First, Don Shapleigh, chief executive of Atlanta Internet, says he does not plan to open any customer offices. \"I have the WorldNet. I have other ways to get out.\" Federally insured Atlanta Internet currently offers its services to subscribers of AT & T's WorldNet Services.\nShapleigh also argues that Atlanta Internet is the first true Internet only bank, saying that Security First is really a software company.\n\"I'm not selling software,\" he said. \"I'm a banker.\"\nAtlanta Internet, which is a service provided by a unit of Carolina First Corp. can be reached on the Internet at (www.atlantabank.com).", "Federal regulators are set to kick off a two-part plan to slash rates on overseas phone calls, a move that could save consumers and companies billions of dollars but may ruffle the feathers of foreign governments.\nThe Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to make it simpler for U.S. and foreign phone companies to negotiate cheaper rates for international calls to and from the United States.\nNext month the FCC is expected to propose rules to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete overseas calls made from the United States.\n\"The ultimate goal is to get lower-priced and better-quality services for consumers,\" said Don Gips, head of the FCC's international bureau.\nOfficials say the foreign charges, or \"accounting rates,\" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.\nU.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.\n\"This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.\nWhile the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.\nThe United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others.\n\"Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous\" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.\nU.S. carriers support the strategy.\n\"You've got to move accounting rates to cost,\" said AT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost is 7 to 8 cents a minute.\nThe FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.\nTo cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as possibly Britain, Canada and Chile.\nThe FCC will waive its \"proportionate return\" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for overseas calls. To win a waiver, a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.\nThe existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market.\nIf AT&T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&T.\nThe FCC proposal due next month would set \"benchmark\" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.\nThe agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.\n\"It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,\" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\nBut the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidise local phone service.", "Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.\nAnalysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97.\n\"You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997,\" Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  \n\"There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997,\" he said.\n\"You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing.\"\nThe median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.\nThis compares with a 44 percent rise between 1993/94 and 1994/95.", "CMS Energy Co should have no trouble meeting or exceeding the $2.40 to $2.45 a share earnings estimates that analysts forecast for all of 1996, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William McCormick said Friday.\n\"We feel very comfortable we'll be at or above that range,\" he said in a telephone interview from the utility's Dearborn, Mich. headquarters. CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned $2.27 a share on total revenues of $3.9 billion in 1995.  \nEarlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10-year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.\nThe settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  \n\"The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,\" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.\nMcCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings write-downs related to the project. CMS recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  \nCMS' stock was up $1 to $32-3/8. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.\nCMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid-1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gas-powered energy plant in 1990.\nMidland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS; Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.\nApproval of the settlement prompted Standard & Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and re-affirm its ratings on the companies.\nMcCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.", "Family-controlled British food and retailing group Associated British Foods should report a sharp rise in full year profits on Monday, as its retail and textile business benefit from a pickup in high street spending.\n\"The two parts of the business really driving the increase are the retail and clothing side which is benefitting from the feel-good factor,\" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. Analysts forecasts are centred on pretax profits of 415 million stg up from 375 million last time and a dividend increase to 9.5p from 8.8p.  \nABF, a food processor and manufacturer in Britain, Australia and the United States, as well as a food and textile retailer in Britain and Ireland, is also widely expected to yield yet more cash from British Sugar.\n\"The feature of the figures as ever is the strong cashflow coming out of British sugar. Net cash should rise by about 130 million pounds which always begs the question will they spend it?\" said UBS analyst Charlie Mills.\nThat would bring net cash to 735 million stg at year end.  \nOn the retail side PriMark, women's clothing chain in Ireland and Britain, as well as the Irish retailing businesses -- Stewarts supermarkets in Northern Ireland and Crazy Prices and Quinnsworth -- are expected to perform much better.\nHowever the mainstream side of the business, British Sugar which contributes about 50 percent of profits, is likely to be slightly weaker after a hot summer in 1995 affected the sugar beet crop and margins came under pressure from the strength of sterling which made European imports look cheaper.  \nAside from British sugar, analysts expect the grocery business, like milling and baking, Rivita and Burton biscuits to show improvements.\nOn average analysts forecast trading profit from groceries, excluding British Sugar, to rise by 14 million stg to 82 million in the belief that the company has managed to claw back some of the margin on non-packaged food.\nIncluding British Sugar operating profits are predicted to increase to about 265 million from 252 million previously.\nABF shares have risen consistently from 280p in January to 418-1/2p at Friday's close.\nConsensus estimates, taken from a Reuter poll of 17 brokers, for 1996 is 30.1, rising to 31.6 in 1997.\nThe company has a return on equity of 11.5 percent, putting it in 28th slot in the FTSE-All share food manufaturing sector of 57 companies.", "Investment bank Macquarie Bank Ltd reported on Monday a record result for the six months ended September 30, and started the second half optimistically.\nMacquarie Bank, which is 13.4 percent owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), reported a 21.3 percent rise in first half net profit to A$46.03 million in the first half of 1996/97.\n\"This was a very solid first half result and one which reflects more even contributions fom business groups across the bank,\" executive chairman David Clarke said.  \n\"Although it is too early to make a forecast, we are optimistic about the second half,\" Clarke said.\nWhile the 1995/96 second half was very strong, he said the bank was hopeful it could at least match the result.\n\"There has been nothing to change that view following the trading for the first two months of this half.\"\nManaging director Allan Moss said the equities, treasury and commodities group accounted for most of the first half rises.\n\"The Treasury and Commodities Group's first half result is the best since the formation of the group in 1993,\" Moss said.  \n\"The strong result in the Equities Group reflects good performances from institutional and corporate stockbroking and underwriting,\" Moss said.\nMoss said the near 400 percent increase in profit from its stockbroking arm, Macquarie Equities Ltd, was due partly to an increase in market share, but mainly due to market volume.\nMacquarie's Direct Investment division, which manages the Macquarie Investment Trusts, also had a good result, Moss said.\nThe bank was currently very active right across all its operations, Moss said. \"We are busy right across the board. There is a lot of activity in all our operations,\" he said.  \nMacquarie said total operating income rose to A$232.69 million in the half, from A$190.21 million a year earlier.\nThe Brunei government-owned BIA became Macquarie's largest shareholder after it bought Lloyds TSB Plc's 13.4 percent stake for A$151.7 million last week.\nMacquarie's chairman said there had been a good reaction to the link with BIA.\n\"We have had a very positive reaction from a number of existing clients, particularly in southeast Asia. I think it has been widely acclaimed in southeast Asia that it would lead to more business in the region,\" Clarke said.  \nMacquarie, which listed in late July, reported a net profit of A$93.17 million in the year to March 31, 1996, up from A$76.07 million a year earlier.\nClarke said Macquarie had no plans to return capital to shareholders or to make a takeover due to its high capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Macquarie's CAR was 13.6 percent at September 30, down from 15.4 percent at March 31, 1996.\nThis ratio compares with the Reserve Bank of Australia's minimum requirement of eight percent.\n\"As far as any prospect of share acquisition or buy-back, we have nothing in mind yet,\" Clarke said.  \n\"I think it is the nature of our business to have a capital adequacy ratio that is higher than the trading banks because we are very dependent on counter-party limits from other banks, they in turn are quite dependent on ratings...it is a healthy capital adequacy ratio and I think we can expect to be well and truly above the basic minimum,\" Clarke said.\nAt 2.00 p.m. (0300 GMT), Macquarie shares were 11 cents lower at A$8.55 with about 160,000 shares traded in a generally weaker Australian sharemarket.\nThe shares listed on the local bourse in July at A$6.95.", "Westpac Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia, announced plans on Wednesday to expand its Asian activities through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc.\nThe move signals Westpac is ready to expand in the region again after putting most of its Asian activities up for sale 3-1/2 years ago to focus on Australasia.\nAt the time a recession was biting deeply into profits and the share register held potential predators such as Australia's richest man Kerry Packer and Lend Lease Corp Ltd.  \nWestpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement the deal with Standard Chartered was of major importance.\n\"It is a good strategic fit for our future growth,\" he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to \"ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long term benefit to both companies\".\nThe venture would focus primarily on Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, before expanding into Vietnam and China in about six months, said David Morgan, group executive of Westpac Institutional and International Banking.", "Germany and the Czech republic announced on Monday that a long-awaited declaration on post- World War Two reconciliation would be initialled this week but politicians on both sides withheld final approval of the text.\nThe two foreign ministries said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Germany's Klaus Kinkel would sign the document in Prague on Friday, at a ceremony ending two years of talks.\nThe declaration, expressing regret at both Nazi atrocities during the war and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from former Czechoslovakia afterwards, then has to be signed by the two countries' presidents and confirmed by the two parliaments.\nBut Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), political sponsor of the expelled Germans, said its support for the text was not guaranteed.\n\"I would speak of a conditional'yes',\" Finance Minister and CSU chairman Theo Waigel told reporters. He said last-minute changes to the text could not be ruled out.\nFinal approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudeten Germans, as they are known, would be \"involved at an appropriate level\" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn, he said.\nThe Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.\nIn the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.\nMembers of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.\n\"(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),\" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.\nStanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.\nThe Czech foreign ministry said in a statement that Zieleniec and Kinkel would \"sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development\".\nThe full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.\nThe text angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who had lost property during the expulsions.\nThe declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.\nThe text says the fund is to finance \"projects of common interest\" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.\nBut the text adds that: \"The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.\"\nGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nIn early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.", "America Online Inc, the world's largest online service, said with the changes it implemented earlier this fall and its major restructuring announced this week, it is seeing a renewed momentum.\nSteve Case, AOL chairman and CEO, told the company's annual meeting that with the reoganization of AOL, its new flat-rate pricing, and its big accounting changes, \"the pieces are now in place\" for growth, not only in new subscribers, but with major new sources of revenue, such as advertising.  \n\"Now we have a new structure in place...and the momentum is stronger than ever,\" Case told shareholders, adding that in the month of October alone, AOL added 250,000 new subscribers, a sign of its \"renewed momentum.\"\nThe company, which has seen its stock decline, has been under pressure from the lower-cost Internet access services and has seen its subscriber growth slow this summer.  \nAOL, based in Dulles, Va., was further pressured when Microsoft Corp relaunched the Microsoft Network this month at a flat price of $19.95 for unlimited access, on par with most direct Internet access services.\nPreviously, AOL had added a 20/20 pricing plan to combat the growing competition, with 20 hours for $19.95 a month, in addition to its $9.95 for 10 hours plan.  But on Monday, it succumbed with its own flat rate $19.95 a month, and it will discontinue its direct Internet access, called GNN.  \nCase and other AOL executives highlighted to shareholders how the company will see new sources of revenue from advertising and merchandising and how one area of its new business will be running on a cable industry model, with more revenues from advertising than subscriber fees.\n\"Increasingly, we are evolving where we depend less on subscriber revenue and increasingly on advertising and other sources,\" said Lennert Leader, the company's chief financial officer.  \nOne of the areas from which the company expects this growth to come is its new unit AOL Networks, headed by former MTV executive Bob Pittman, to oversee AOL's flagship online service.  The other two units in AOL's reorganization are its AOL Studios, to create content for its service and ANS Communications, to manage the core network infrastructure.\nPittman said he expects that in the future, over 50 percent of AOL's revenues will come from advertising and other revenue sources, such as merchandising the AOL brand name, through books, television, etc.  \n\"To me, it looks very similar to the cable network business,\" Pittman said, adding that in the early days of Viacom Inc's MTV network, subscriber revenue was greater than advertising revenue.  \"Our growth curve looks very similar to the cable business.  Ad revenue is growing faster than subsciber revenues.\"\nPittman said he plans to \"ride the tremendous wave\" of AOL's brand recognition for new sources of revenue growth, for which he said there are multi-levels of possibilities. One area, he mentioned after his second day on the job, is the catalog business, which can move to electronic shopping.  \nShareholders, some of whom said the stock has been a very good investment because of its many stock splits, said they were pleased with AOL's recent actions, in particular the measure to restructure accounting methods.\n\"The fact that they are getting a more straightforward accounting system is a step in the right direction,\" said David Ryan, a retired shareholder from the Washington, D.C. area. \"Their financial statements were hard to understand. It's more straightforward now.\"  Ryan said the stock has split three times since he has owned it in the past four or five years.  \nAOL said on Monday that it will now expense all its marketing costs, which includes the hefty subscriber acquisition costs, as they are incurred, instead of deferring those costs over time.\nTo reflect those immediate changes, AOL is taking a $385 million restructuring charge in the September quarter, to account for the balance of its deferred subscriber acquisition costs.  AOL CFO Leader also told the meeting that the cost to acquire new subscribers will be lower in the future, as AOL depends less on sending out floppy disks, and as AOL comes with more new PCs.\n\"The good news is the growth is accelerating,\" Case said. \"We have taken the step of expensing the marketing and we can avoid some of the debates about the earnings.\"", "Britain's Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.\n\"We think we can stand on our own feet,\" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.\nThe building society's nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  \nGilchrist said the building society's decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.\nIt will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.\n\"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,\" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  \n\"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,\" Gilchrist said.\nEarlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.\nGilchrist said members would get a \"broad idea\" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  \nHe also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.\n\"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,\" he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote \"as quickly as possible\" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  \n\"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,\" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nBut it was working on the basis that a \"large number\" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.\nThose who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.\nIf eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they \"may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting\" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.", "Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.\n\"We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,\" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.\nFlemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.\nFlemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.\nSome analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was \"a very good start\" and showed new businesses were \"making a valuable contribution to profitability.\"\n\"While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,\" Manser said in a statement.\nThe Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.\nFlemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.\nAnd in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.\nThis resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming's London-based fund company. In September the company's chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.\nFlemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a \"marginally lower\" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.\nThis was after taking into account provisions \"arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years,\" it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.\nHe described the events as a \"painful experience.\" \"But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand,\" he added.\nAny impact these problems may have had on Flemings' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.\nFlemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported \"a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking.\"\nIts capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.\nThe appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.\nWilliam Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.", "Polar Air Cargo is to start new services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai in Japan and Manila within the next four months, the all cargo carrier's executive vice president Jack Kane said.\nSpeaking after the handover of Polar's first Boeing 747-200 and 14th 747 freighter in all, Kane said the new acquistion from Air Hong Kong will offer longer ranges, higher weights and reduced fuel consumption for the company's Asian network which is about to rapidly expand.\nPolar is awaiting final U.S. Depart of Transportation approval to begin flying to Kansai after agreement with the Japanese transportation ministry that Polar should become the third U.S. all cargo carrier, he said.\n\"The indications seem very favourable,\" he said.\nThe U.S.-based airline has also won permission to fly to Bangkok and expects to start services to Manila in the first quarter of 1997.

The 747-200 means Polar no longer has to stop in Khabarovsk in Russia to refuel.\nPolar does not have rights into China but has been holding discussions with Chinese airlines on a possible joint venture. Kane declined to name the possible partners but said Polar has already cooperated with China Eastern on charter cargo flights.\nKane said Polar intends to start operating a second 747-200 aircraft, an ex Philippine Airlines Combi which is to be converted, in the first quarter of next year.

Negotiators have met only during normal business hours and do not plan to meet over the weekend.\nUAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to characterize progress of the discussions, only to say bargainers were \"down to the larger issues.\"\nBut Hargrove has not asked Yokich to delay a U.S. settlement with GM during the Canadian strike.\nThe CAW launched an escalating strike on October 3 and all the union's 26,000 GM workers were on the picket line by midnight on Wednesday.  \nThe UAW has about 215,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM and, so far, only about 2,000 have been idled at an engine plant and a transmission plant.\nThe strike may affect some of GM's U.S. plants next week, although the automaker canceled most overtime work this week.\nHargrove said he saw no progress in talks with the automaker.\n\"I don't want to kid anybody,\" he said. \"It hasn't been very productive last few days, I do not believe it will be productive today.\"\nHargrove wanted the Canadian walkout to have as little effect on GM's U.S. production as possible so as to protect UAW workers and the profit-sharing checks they expect to receive this year. Prolonged shutdowns in the U.S. due to lack of Canadian-made parts could seriously hurt GM's profits and reduce profit sharing for employees.", "Sun Microsystems Inc. said Wednesday its profits rose 41 percent in the latest quarter and its revenues jumped to record levels, driven by sales of the company's server computer and power desktop systems.\nSun said its net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 29 rose to $178.3 million from $126 million in second quarter a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 46 cents from 32 cents.\nRevenues rose nearly 19 percent to $2.08 billion.\nThe per share earnings beat Wall Street expectations of 42 cents, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.\n\"The current fiscal year continues to yield strong financial results,\" Sun Microsystems Chief Financial Officer Michael Lehman said in a statement. \"Sun is winning big in corporate intranets, the Internet, and the extranet.\"\nSo-called intranets are in-house networks modeled on the Internet, while extranets, which are secure networks outside a company, such as a private network.\nLehman said the company's investments in research and development and sales and support infrastructure were paying off as it moved to broaden its global presence.\nThe company said gross profit margins rose to 50.4 percent, up more than 5 percentage points from the comparable period the previous year.\nSun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy told analysts in a conference call that it was difficult to say whether the strong gross margins were sustainable.\nSun's order backlog rose to $470 million from $407 million in its first quarter, but it was still much less than the $522 million backlog at the end of its 1996 fiscal year last June.\nMcNealy said the company planned to announce new high-end computers, codenamed Starfire, next week as it seeks to offer computers that can be used for the most intensive corporate computing tasks, like databases and network management.\nLehman said initial market data showed Sun appeared to be taking market share from its traditional rivals, and he said Sun will continue to make further significant price cuts.\nThe executives said Sun was deriving increasing amounts of revenues from storage products, professional services and licensing of products based on the Java programming language, which is used to develop Internet applications.", "Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly plans to double exports to Europe by 2010, mostly via its ambitious $40 billion Yamal pipeline project, but energy analysts said the timing could be wrong.\n\"There's a market problem (with oversupply in Europe), and the cost of developing the Yamal field will be too high,\" said a senior European energy specialist familiar with the project.\n\"Europe is at saturation level for the next 10 years or so, so Gazprom is 5-10 years too early.\"\nThe Yamal-Europe project envisions building a gas pipeline network across 4,107 km (2,550 miles) from Russia's vast Arctic Yamal peninsula reserves to Germany via Belarus and Poland.\nGazprom wants to take advantage of rising European demand.\nTo help raise capital for Yamal, RAO Gazprom is offering American Depositary Shares as part of a plan to sell a total nine percent stake abroad.\n\"Europe can hardly wait for this project,\" said Alexander Litvinov, Gazprom's chief public relations specialist.\nA company statement said: \"The company faces significant requirements for capital expenditures.\"\nThe Yamal system, to be built in stages and linking with existing pipelines in some places, would have an initial capacity of 83 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, including around 52 bcm to Western Europe.\nGazprom said the Yamal-Europe pipeline would boost Russia's export capacity to 124 billion bcm by 1997 and 154 bcm by 1999. Sales outside the former Soviet Union were 117.4 bcm in 1995.\nThe company wants annual exports to rise by 50 bcm by 2010.\nGazprom has won big Western credits to build European parts of the Yamal link into Poland's grid and Belarus, but it has not won financing for the main part of the system or to boost output at Yamal itself, which it hopes to begin doing by 2000.\nPierre Bauquis, special adviser to the president of French company Total SA, told an energy conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty last week that Russia had huge gas reserves but big financial constraints.\n\"Yamal is not needed before 2010,\" he said.\nHe said netbacks (a key indicator of profitability) on Yamal gas to Germany today were negative, \"so Yamal is not obvious from an economic standpoint.\"\nGazprom sees Yamal as the goose that will lay the golden egg, since the area has recoverable reserves of 10,400 bcm, or 20 percent of Russia's total proven reserves.\nBut Yamal gas, some under permafrost, is in a remote area and is quite expensive to recover.\nSome analysts say it may be cheaper to tap and transport Algerian and Norwegian gas to European markets than to extract Yamal gas in the volumes and time-frame Gazprom plans.\nRussian gas already accounts for 60 percent of Europe's total gas imports. Russia has more than one-third of world gas reserves and 26 percent of output, and is the world's single largest producer, with output of 556 bcm last year.\nGazprom accounts for 94 percent of Russian gas output and transports nearly all of it. The firm wants output to rise to 820 bcm a year by 2010.\nRussia exports only 20 percent of its output, and declining industrial consumption at home has left Russia with an oversupply. Europe is also flush with supplies, though demand is set to rise.\n\"The fact that Gazprom does not have its own financing for Yamal and that it has not been able to find domestic or foreign financing (for the main part of the project) speaks quite negatively about its economics,\" said the European source.", "Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment.\nThe 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines.\nThe deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.  \nNew Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems.\n\"It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,\" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom.\nHowever, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.  \nIn the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems.\nTo speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.  \nAs part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard.\nModems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.  \nIn the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard.\nU.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O.\nRobotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said.\nRockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.  \nNonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier.\nMicrocom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.  \nMicrocom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat.\nMicrocom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997.\nThayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support.\n\"They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,\" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership.\nHowever, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives.\nThis plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said.", "Despite losing out on two potential aircraft deals, McDonnell Douglas Corp's stock remains near its 52-week high, reflecting a strong balance sheet and expectations it will make an acquisition.\n\"The company is generating on the order of about $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion of free cash flow annually, which translates into between $5 and $7 a share,\" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch, who has a buy rating on the stock.\nThat could enable the company to buy back shares or make a long-awaited defense acquisition, he added.  \nAlthough it lost out on the race to build a next generation fighter for the Pentagon and rival Boeing Co was awarded a 103-plane AMR Corp deal, McDonnell Douglas shares remain relatively strong.  Shares were down $0.25 at $52.625 a share on Monday, $4.125 below a 52-week high of $56.75 but more than $10 above a low of $42.125.\nIn fact, losing out on the potential $2.2 billion in jet fighter contracts -- which could eventually be worth as much as $500 billion to the ultimate winner -- could prompt McDonnell Douglas to pursue an acquisition aggressively to build its defense business, analysts added.  \nCS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said he expected the company's \"board and management to take a fairly proactive stance...to do something in the merger and acquisition area.\"\nAnalysts also shrugged off Boeing getting the plane order from AMR's American Airlines, saying McDonnell Douglas was not a serious contender after it cancelled development of its next generation commercial plane, known as the MD-XX.\n\"They were never in the running,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan said of McDonnell Douglas.  \n\"The events don't affect near-term earnings in either case,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel said of the lost jet fighter and American Airlines deals.\nMcDonnell Douglas management said the Pentagon business would have been a significant long-term program for it.  But analysts said the company still has a chance to capture future military sales, particularly with acquisitions to build its portfolio, which now includes the F-18 fighter jet, C-17 military cargo plane and Apache helicopter.  \n\"The things to keep in mind are, the joint strike fighter is a long ways away.  It doesn't affect McDonnell Douglas' business portfolio near term,\" Callan said.\nCallan added it is possible the new fighter jet might not be developed due to U.S. government budget pressures. And, in the interim, McDonnell Douglas could make its existing fighter jets more affordable and more capable.\nAnalysts dismissed the ideas that takeover speculation has been boosting McDonnell Douglas shares.  Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas was reported to be in preliminary merger talks with Boeing, but a deal never materialized.  \"I don't think the people who own the stock today are looking at McDonnell Douglas as a takeover candidate,\" Callan said.", "The Czech ruling centre-right coalition agreed on Monday to name Vlasta Parkanova as justice minister, replacing Jan Kalvoda who resigned last month after he admitted to using an unattained \"Doctor of Law\" title.\nBut coalition leaders agreed to wait on the choice of a replacement for Kalvoda, who is chairman of a small right-wing junior coalition party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), in the more politically-sensitive post of deputy prime minister.\n\"We received an official proposal from the ODA for a new justice minister.... as Doctor Parkanova. We approved this proposal by the ODA on the coalition level,\" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the head of the senior Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference.\nAfter a meeting with his coalition partners Klaus said that Parkanova could be officially appointed by President Vaclav Havel as soon as Tuesday.\nParkanova, 45, a certified doctor of law, currently serves as a chief of staff at the Interior Ministry.\nShe would become the first woman to have a seat in the Prague government since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.\nODA vice chairman Karel Ledvinka said the coalition agreed to a request by his party to postpone nomination of the new deputy prime minister, who would lead the party in the tenuous minority cabinet, until after the party's congress in March.\nKalvoda's position as chairman of the pro-business ODA is also to be decided at the March party congress.\nThe ODA has four seats in the 16-member cabinet under a coalition agreement with the ODS and the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), plus one of four deputy premierships.\nKalvoda and the KDU-CSL leader Josef Lux have fought heated policy battles with Klaus's party, which controls half of the cabinet, but the coalition remains the longest-running conservative government in post-Communist Europe.\nTensions have been heightened since June when the coalition lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.\nKalvoda, a parliamentary deputy and a cabinet member since the coalition was formed in 1992, was the fifth member of parliament who admitted using the title of Juris Doctor without actually having qualified for it.\nOut of the other four fake doctors, only one has resigned her parliamentary seat.", "Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy.\nShares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.\nThe Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995.\nDeclining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.\n\"Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,\" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.\nThe key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard & Poors 500.\nThe Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.\nBank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.\nHe added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.\n\"The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,\" Thiessen said.\nAfter several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.\nCanada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.\nSeveral Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.\nGregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. \"I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,\" he said.\n\"Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,\" Gregory said.\nThe Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995.\nIn stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks.\nThe TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday.

The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.\nRecent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks.\nNew York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.", "Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.\nEncryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" were once the realm of spies and generals.\nBut with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.\nSenators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.\nThe bills \"roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,\" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.\n\"Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,\" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican, also a co-sponsor.\nThe bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.\nUnder the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software \"key\" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.\nIf the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.\nThe legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.\nThe Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.\n\"We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,\" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. \"We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.\"\nComputer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.\n\"Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,\" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.\n\"This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,\" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.\nBerman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be \"my lock, my key.\"", "Hunting so-called \"fat cats\" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country's top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders.\nThe latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets.\nBut questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain's most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance.\nBoth last year's Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.\nThis has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.\n\"Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,\" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.\nSkipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit.\nThis means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.\n\"It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,\" one industry insider told Reuters.\nLast week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.\nMelville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.\nA row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.\nLast year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.\n\"That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),\" Norwich Union's Skipper said.\nThe Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies \"have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers\".\nSkipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. \"It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,\" she said.\nBut her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.\nHis mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.", "Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can close suddenly without warning.\nNearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.\nThe problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.\nNHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.\nOwners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.\nChrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.\nChrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.\nChrysler told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.\nChrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.\nBut NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.\nChrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson said the automaker was working with the safety agency to resolve the complaints. Injuries reported from sudden closings of rear hatch doors have been minor, she said, noting Chrysler stood behind the safety record of its vehicles.\n\"Minivans are the safest vehicles on the road today,\" she said.\nSeparately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.\nIn addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.\nAlso, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle.

Later surgeons described the planned surgery as \"medium serious\".\nThe Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.\nHavel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.\nUnder the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel's place.\nHavel's power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.\nOpinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.\nTurnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.\nHavel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.", "China hailed on Tuesday its war on bourgeois decadence as the top news event of 1996 along with missile tests off Taiwan, but ignored improved ties with the United States and the jailing of a dozen dissidents.\nThe line-up of the top 10 news events in China in 1996 as selected by senior editors of the major Communist Party-linked newspapers closely reflected the party line on news -- or propaganda.\nThe list issued by the Xinhua news agency differed sharply from events in China that have focused international eyes on the world's most populous country in the last 12 months.\nHeading the list selected by 12 Beijing editors was the annual plenum of China's ruling Communist Party in October that adopted a 15,000-word document exhorting China's 1.2 billion people to adhere to socialist ethics and abhor bourgeois Western liberalism.\nOn Christmas Eve, it was unclear how far socialist values extended, but Santa Claus appeared to be exempt as he smiled and waved from dozens of Beijing and Shanghai department stores.\nPolitics, not only news value, may have coloured the views of many of the editors, who would have remembered that the plenum was trumpeted as one of the major achievements of Communist Party chief, state President and army boss Jiang Zemin -- anointed heir to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nNewspaper editors elsewhere in the world would probably have chosen Beijing's campaign to intimidate Taiwan in the run-up the island's first popular elections of a Chinese president on Chinese soil as the top story of 1996.\nHowever, for Chinese editors the decision to conduct missile tests and live-fire war games in waters near the island last March, and which sent U.S. aircraft carriers steaming into neighbouring seas, ranked only fourth in their top 10.\nThe news item in second place related to China's resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong in mid-1997, or Premier Li Peng's decision to sign off on the appointment of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive.\nOther editors might have focused less on the role of a single Chinese leader in Tung's elevation and more on his selection by a Beijing-sponsored committee of his peers.\nFour of the top 10 Chinese news stories were linked to economic achievements and one to sports -- the Atlanta Olympic Games in which China ranked fourth overall in the medals' tally.

Colder climates would shorten the vehicles' already limited range, which is a maximum of 70 to 90 miles under ideal conditions, GM says.\nCalifornia, which recently eased its 1998 mandate for electric vehicles, is expected to offer consumer incentives for the vehicle.\nDepending on such incentives, monthly lease payments on the car will probably fall between $400 and $500, about the same as a $30,000 luxury car, GM officials said at a news briefing.\nCustomers will have to add another $50 a month or so to lease a 220-volt charging unit and pay to have it mounted in their garage. But the electricity to run the EV1 is a bargain -- about a penny a mile, versus gasoline costs of four to five cents a mile for an average normal car.\nGM executives will not discuss production plans or sales targets for the vehicle and say they plan to let market dictate demand. But Kennedy said he expects the initial demand to outstrip supply due to the vehicle's novelty.\nSo far, about 1,000 people have called a toll-free telephone number, and dealers have taken names of 300 serious customers, including Tonight Show host Jay Leno, he said.\nCustomers who want performance won't be disappointed with the EV1. The whisper-quiet vehicle offers neck-snapping acceleration and sports-car like handling, although a heavy foot will quickly drain the battery, requiring a three- to four-hour recharge.\n\"We can keep up with a Nissan 300ZX from zero to 30\" miles an hour, said Sean McNamara, marketing manager for GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group.\nThe car's aerodynamic tear-drop shape, considerably narrower in the rear than in the front, slips through the wind easily and looks unlike anything else on the road.\nGM could have built a spartan small boxy car but wanted its first electric vehicle to have some flair, said Robert Purcell, general manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles.\n\"This is the car that gets the market started,\" he said. \"We wanted to put out a car that was very exciting so that people would fall in love with it.\"\nThe sporty configuration was aimed at highly educated customers with incomes of $125,000 a year who like high technology, GM said. The customers also likely own two other vehicles for longer trips or heavy hauling.\nSaturn, which won't necessarily sell all future GM electric vehicles, plans to emphasise its customer-friendly sales practices more heavily for the EV1.\nThe decision to lease the vehicle was made in part to protect consumers from the inevitable march of technology. The automaker does not want EV1 customers to be stuck with obsolete cars in a few years, as personal computer owners often are.\nAt the end of the lease, GM is considering refitting the plastic and aluminum-bodied cars with newer technology and leasing them again, Purcell said.\nThe division also is training about 14 EV1 \"product specialists\" to handle sales of the vehicle at 26 designated dealerships in California and Arizona.\nThe specialists will come to a prospective customer's home, office, or elsewhere to explain the details of the car and the charging unit.\nThey'll work with the utility companies and arrange municipal permits for the installations, Kennedy said, adding that it will probably take about a week to set up a customer with a car and charger.\nGM has invested $350 million in developing the EV1, which it does not expect to recoup through sales of the first generation vehicle, Purcell said. But the car does pioneer a wide range of exotic materials and new technology that could find its way to other GM vehicles.\nMagnesium and other lightweight materials counteract the weight of batteries, and the cars have braking systems that transfer power back to the battery.\nDespite the technology, the cars are largely hand-built at a Lansing, Mich., plant that produced the now-defunct Buick Reatta in the late 1980s. The operation employs 54 production workers but could be expanded quickly, GM officials said.", "At least 23 people were murdered in attacks in central and northern Colombia, including an entire family hacked to death with machetes, police said on Thursday.\nUnidentified axe and machete-wielding assailants killed three children, their mother and grandparents early on Thursday in San Miguel de Sema, in central Boyaca province, police chief Col. Humberto Prieto said.\n\"We're investigating to see if these killings are related to the death of two other relatives several years ago. Early indications suggest they were murdered for personal reasons -- a revenge attack,\" Prieto said.\nBoyoca is known as a stronghold of right-wing paramilitary groups but Prieto said San Miguel was not affected by right-wing or leftist political violence.\nIn northern Sucre province, the bullet-ridden bodies of 17 peasants were found scattered in four isolated areas near the town of Tolu Viejo on Thursday morning, police said.\n\"We're still looking at all the facts. The province has been hard hit by subversion,\" said Benjamin Irragori, regional head of the state security service DAS.\nHe said two fronts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were active in the area.\nSucre has seen a recent rash of attacks by right-wing paramilitary death squads. One television report, which quoted a police source as saying the leading suspects in the massacre were rightists, showed some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.\nAlmost 40 people died in a wave of killings, attributed to paramilitary groups, across northern Colombia two weeks ago. Last month, the country's paramilitary forces held a summit in which they pledged to step up their war against leftist guerrillas and rebel sympathisers.\nIn a separate attack in the city of Cucuta, in northeast Norte de Santander province, a Roman Catholic priest was gunned down by two unidentified killers on Wednesday evening, police said.\nHe was the third priest killed in two months -- a sign, some clergymen say, that they are increasingly caught in the crossfire of guerrilla and paramilitary violence, which has surged in recent months.\n\"The basic problem is not the lack of respect for priests but the total disregard for the value of human life,\" said Monsignor Juan Francisco Sarasti, vice president of Colombia's Episcopal Conference.", "One day after rival bidders sent its stock on a rollercoaster ride, Conrail Inc was set Tuesday to formally consider a $9 billion takeover offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.\nThe company's board of directors was widely expected to reject the unsolicited Norfolk Southern offer in favor of a friendly $8.4 billion deal with CSX Corp.\n\"My guess is, at this point, that they stick with the CSX proposal,\" said Brian Routledge of Prudential Securities.  \nConrail's board was slated to meet Tuesday ahead of a Wednesday deadline to respond to the Norfolk Southern offer.\nA Conrail spokesman declined to comment on the timing of its decision, but Wall Street experts expected the company to issue an announcement on Wednesday.\nConrail agreed on Oct. 15 to be bought by CSX in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or $92.50 per share. Norfolk launched its $100-per-share bid on Oct. 23.\nSince then, Norfolk Southern and CSX have vehemently attacked each other's offers and landed in court.  \nThe CSX-Norfolk Southern relationship between took a new twist Monday when the companies announced they were holding discussions about their bids, but offered conflicting accounts about the talks. Uncertainty about those talks prompted sharp stock declines on Monday.\nIndustry experts said Conrail is likely to defend the lower CSX bid by citing the strategic benefits of the transaction and the lack of potential legal problems associated with the friendly deal. Legal expoerts have said that Pennsylvania takeover law could impede a Norfolk Southern acquisition of Conrail.  \nExperts also speculated that Conrail may try to convince CSX to sweeten its offer in an attempt to appease shareholders who may be upset by the rejection of a higher bid.\nRailroad industry experts have said that CSX likely cannot afford to match Norfolk Southern's $100 cash offer, but may be able to restructure the bid to increase the cash portion of the transaction.\n\"I think it is a strong likelihood that any positive reaction from Conrail's bid toward the Norfok Southern bid will force CSX to sweeten their bid,\" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.", "International copper prices are likely to stick to the high road for some time yet, pricing the metal out of the key China market, Far East metal traders said on Monday.\n\"The LME (London Metal Exchange) will move higher and will test US$2,100 (a tonne),\" a base metal trader in Hong Kong said.\n\"We want it to go down. $1,800 to $1,900 is workable.\"\nCopper prices on the LME rallied through the psychological barrier of US$2,000 a tonne on Friday, hitting $2,027 in late afternoon trading.\nThis rally pushed the international price above the domestic Chinese price, rendering imports senseless, traders said.\nOn the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the most active February 1997 contract opened at 19,550 yuan ($2,355) a tonne, consolidating around that level within the first half-hour.\nChina levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) on copper imports, killing margins at current prices, traders said.\nSoggy Chinese business would be further dampened, traders said. One source at a Chinese listed company said he had 200 tonnes of the red metal to sell at a premium of $100 over the LME spot price.\nThe premium on copper, CIF (cost, insurance and freight) to Hong Kong and Chinese ports, was $150 last week, traders said.\n\"We will not have any import business (with China) with such high LME prices,\" another trader in Hong Kong said. \"We are getting calls from Chinese offering copper back to the market.\"\n\"Premiums are not the issue, the total price is the concern -- and even with no premium it is difficult,\" he said.\nAmong the bears, the head of a trading house in Hong Kong bullishly noted signs the central government was attempting to stimulate the property market could see copper and aluminium users stocking up.\nCancellation of interest rate subsidies, interest rate reductions and the removal of private car purchase quotas were aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy, he said.\n\"I think the whole picture will change,\" he said.\n\"We have been waiting for a very long time and we have known they (Chinese authorities) are moving in this direction. It will restart cash flow and that will re-stimulate the economy very, very quickly,\" he said.\nHe and other traders said Chinese consumers' stocks, usually kept at one month's supply or around 100,000 tonnes, have been run down.\n\"Consumers have nothing and if they have to accumulate investory in their warehouses because of the change of sentiment, the damage to the market will disappear,\" he said.\nOther sources said the Shanghai Metal Exchange had around 15,000 tonnes of copper in stock.\nDrawdowns from LME warehouse stocks over the past couple of months indicated demand in Europe was picking up, traders said.\n\"If it continues, we will not have enough material, especially as there is no scrap around at the moment and LME stocks are down (to 145,825 tonnes),\" said the trading house boss.\n\"The situation could become critical by the end of the year,\" he said.", "French subscriber television company Canal Plus said on Friday it was merging with Nethold, a Dutch satellite television company, to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups.\nNethold is jointly held by Richemont SA, which is quoted on the Zurich and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and MIH Holdings Ltd, a listed holding company.\n\"This merger is a major strategic move, resulting in the creation of one of the largest television groups in the world...particularly in the field of pay-TV with over 8.5 million subscribers,\" Canal Plus said in a statement.\nThe new group will have significant positions in France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries and Germany as well as a presence in several growing markets in central Europe.\nThe Paris stockmarket authorities had suspended trading in Canal Plus shares on Friday morning, sparking speculation of a link up between the French firm and Nethold.\nIts stock closed at 1,169 francs on Thursday.\nUtilities group Cie Generale des Eaux, a key shareholder in Canal Plus, said in a separate statement it was delighted with the merger plan, which marked big step in Canal Plus's international development.\nThe pact would give the French company access to the fast-growing Italian market, Generale des Eaux said.\nIt would also give the new group greater weight in negotiating purchases of copyrights and open opportunities for the launch of European theme channels.\nGenerale des Eaux said it was comfortable with its investment in Canal Plus. It said that in agreement with other Canal Plus shareholders, it would seek to maintain the same scale of investment in the new company.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Canal Plus will buy 100 percent of Nethold from Richemont and MIH, paying with 6.1 million new Canal Plus shares and $45 million in cash.\nFollowing the issue of new Canal Plus shares, Richemont and MIH will respectively own 15 and five percent of Canal Plus.\nCie Financiere Richemont has interests in luxury goods and tobacco and owns such famous brandnames as Cartier, Mont Blanc, Rothmans and Dunhill.\nCanal Plus said the deal had the backing of its main shareholders, media group Havas, Generale des Eaux, bank Societe Generale, and state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations.\nIt is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.", "Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday its fiscal first quarter profit from operations rose 77 percent, reflecting strong sales of its computer networking equipment.\nThe company, which makes devices that control the flow of information between computers in a network, said earnings before gains and charges rose to $320.8 million, or 47 cents a share, for the three months ended Oct. 26, from $181.4 million or 28 cents in the same quarter a year ago.\nNet income for the quarter, after taking into account a $174.6 million charge for the acquisition of Telebit Corp. and a $55.1 million gain from the sale of a minority investment, totaled $180.9 million, or 26 cents a share, slightly lower than the year-ago figure.\nRevenues jumped 80 percent to $1.43 billion from $798.3 million.\nWall Street had expected Cisco, the world's biggest computer networking company and a bellwhether technology stock, to report a profit from operations of 46 cents, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nAnalysts said the company had a solid quarter, alleviating concerns in recent weeks about slowing sales of networking equipment.\n\"They surprised us on the revenue,\" said Eric Blachno, analyst at Bear Stearns in New York. \"It was a little higher than we thought.\"\nCisco also managed to keep its gross margins -- a measure of how much profit a company makes from each dollar of sales -- at 65 percent, better than analysts had expected.\nCisco, based in San Jose, Calif., attributed the higher profits to strong sales across all its product lines.\n\"More of our customers are beginning to look at a single vendor\" for all of their networking needs, said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.\nThe company reported its results after the market closed. For the day, the stock had gained $1.125 to close at $61.75. After the earnings release, the shares slipped 25 cents to $61.50 in after-hour trading.\nAnalysts said some investors may have been disappointed that Cisco's earnings per share were not higher. Frequently, Cisco reports per-share results that are at least 3 or 4 cents above forecasts.", "British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday.\n\"I don't think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word,\" one analyst said.\nA proposal to sell-off Greycoat's assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers.\nUK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly.\nThe South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.\nMoorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had \"developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat\".\nIt said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman.\nThey include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.\nThis would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.\nMoorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of \"investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company\".\nThe remainder of the enlarged group would constitute \"an investment, trading and development portfolio\" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by \"at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum\", Moorfield said.\nWhile analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position.\n\"But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,\" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked \"very seriously\" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.\nAnother possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.\nMyerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise \"forced sale\" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.\n\"Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,\" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties.\n\"They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,\" he added.\nBut others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. \"This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,\" the second analyst said.", "John Walter believes that making strategies work within the machinery of AT&T Corp will be the core both of his job as chief operating officer and when he steps up to become chief executive (CEO) in 1998.\n\"You can have the greatest strategy in the world, but if you dont execute, it doesnt matter,\" Walter told Reuters.\nWalter, chairman and chief executive of commercial printing firm R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co, was on Wednesday appointed by AT&T as president and chief operating officer, and heir apparent to AT&T CEO and chairman Robert Allen.  \nWalter will immerse himself in the operations of AT&T during the 14 months when he and Robert Allen work as a team, and emerge capable of holding the reins.\n\"I'm very comfortable with my ability to move this enterprise forward,\" he said in a telephone interview.\nWalter declined to outline areas where he believed AT&T had failed, but underlined achieving objectives and having an appropriate cost base as his clear focus.\n\"We have to have a cost platform which allows us to compete effectively or we are disadvantaged even before we come into the ring,\" he said.  \nAnalysts have repeatedly criticised AT&T's inability to meet its objectives, which has resulted in an erosion of the value of the brand name and a sliding share price.\nAT&T has flung tens of millions in $100 checks at consumer long distance customers only to find them desert again to rivals in the industry. Its share in the $75 billion market has fallen to around 55 percent from 60 two years ago.\n\"They haven't had the level of execution on the consumer side that we should have seen,\" said consultant Chris Landis of TeleChoice, who is also an ex-AT&T executive.  \nAT&T has made repeated attempts to make money in online services and the Internet, but has sold off almost all its creative content efforts and has retreated to a core offering of Internet access.\nFor every acquisition that worked well, like the 1994 purchase of McCaw Cellular, there have been others that failed, like the $7.5 billion 1991 takeover of NCR Corp.\nAdjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.  \nAmong Walter's favorite quotes: \"When you hire, hire people better than you and then you'll build a company of giants. Hire people worse than you and you'll disappear.\"\nPrinting industry analysts say Walter has used technology very effectively to make Donnelley grow, but some say growth came at a price.\n\"A lot of things have been going wrong,\" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price.\nBut analyst Rudolf Hokanson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said Walter was an effective manager.\n\"He tried to make people more accountable, tried to flatten some of the reporting structure,\" said Hokanson.", "Shipments of cocoa from Ivory Coast's main port of Abidjan are matching arrivals, leaving intact a standing stock of about 90,000 tonnes reported at the end of October, shipping sources said on Tuesday.\n\"The majority of transporters are shipping cocoa but some are still cautious as freight rates have not been agreed,\" one port source told Reuters. \"Total stocks have not really changed since last week,\" he added.\nPort sources said arrivals seemed to be picking up with increasing numbers of trucks arriving.\nShipping companies and exporters last week said delays in issuing freight rates and export licences had blocked some cocoa at Abidjan. Exporters now expect 1996/97 export licences to be issued this week.\n\"The Caistab (marketing board) told me licences would be out this week\" said one exporter. \"Some exporters have decided to wait for their licences and bank finances before buying anything but some are going ahead.\"\nShipping companies say they would continue shipping at the 1995/96 reference freight rates agreed with the Caistab last November.\nShipments at the start of the 1995/96 cocoa marketing season were delayed from early October to mid-November when shipping companies refused to cut their freight rates by 25 percent as requested by the Caistab. A cut of seven percent was evenutally agreed.\n\"So far we have avoided a repeat. Shipments have carried on so far but we will just wait see what happens,\" said one port source.\nRates for this year are widely expected to remain unchanged.\nShipping companies have been asked by government agencies to submit detailed information on freight rates and projected volumes for next year but say prices are confidential business information.\nCaistab spokesmen were not immediately available for comment and no date has been set for fixing the reference freight rates for the 1996/97 cocoa season.", "McDonald's Corp. on Friday reported a 10 percent rise in net income, despite a weak U.S. operating environment that was offset by growth overseas.\nThe fast-food giant, which has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide, said net income rose to $440 million from $400 million. Earnings per share gained 11 percent, with fewer shares outstanding, to 62 cents a share from 56 cents.\nEarnings for the quarter, however, were about 1 cent below what analysts had expected.\nMcDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said operating earnings in the United States fell five percent in the third quarter while company revenues rose only one percent.\n\"Our U.S. restaurants are operating in a complex, dynamic and difficult marketplace and recent operating performance has fallen short of our goals,\" Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement.\nMcDonald's said U.S. same store sales -- measuring results for units open at least one year -- were negative for both the third quarter and nine-month period.\nBut U.S. sales may be picking up, said Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes. \"I think (U.S. same store sales) are starting to hit bottom,\" Oakes said. \"Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.\"\nMcDonald's recently reorganized its management to address disappointing results in the United States.\nOutside the United States, McDonald's operating earnings grew 11 percent in the quarter as revenue jumped 13 percent.\nIt said growth in earnings was strongest in Hong Kong, England, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan. Results in Mexico remained weak due to the sluggish economy, it said.\nWhile McDonald's continues to expand its global reach, the company said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.\n\"We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996),\" McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said. \"We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year.\"\nThis would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to meet its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu, or satellite, units.\nIn 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.\nMcDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.\n\"We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991,\" Ebeling said.\nEbeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about \"600-plus\" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.\n\"We recognise we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees,\" Ebeling said.\nMerrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. \"In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty,\" Oakes said.\nEbeling said U.S. satellite units will acount for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, compared with 60 percent as originally planned.\nOverall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's total restaurant openings will still be in the United States.", "Britain's largest home loan lender, Halifax Building Society, said on Thursday it was confident of avoiding any takeover attempt when it floats on the stock market and sheds mutuality for bank status next June.\n\"We think we can stand on our own feet,\" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said.\nThe society, currently owned by its savers and borrowers, gave details of the timetable for conversion and flotation, which analysts have said could be worth 10 billion pounds ($16 billion).\nThe building society's nine million members will vote early next year on the conversion, which it is billing as the largest single extension of private share ownership in Britain.\nGilchrist said a decision to transfer its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose five-year protection against takeover but underlined its confidence.\nAnalysts said the consolidation of Britain's financial services market is likely to continue, which could make the large and successful Halifax a possible target.\nThe flotation will project the society into the top 25 companies in London's blue chip FTSE 100 stock index and Gilchrist said he was confident that shareholders would be convinced by its past performance to reject any bid attempt.\nThe concersion method raises the voting threshold needed for the plans to go ahead, but Gilchrist said he believed the necessary 50 percent of investing members entitled to vote would be met.\n\"We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,\" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.\n\"It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,\" Gilchrist said.\nBut members eagerly expecting to find out how big a windfall they are likely to receive when they receive free shares will have to wait until January before getting any indication.\nThe Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to and indicate their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions.\nGilchrist said members would get a \"broad idea\" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.\nHe also declined to comment on the cost of the conversion exercise. But it seems likely to provide a boon to Britain's postal service and the printing industry as well as the financial and legal advisors working on the plans.\n\"The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,\" he said.\nHalifax members will be urged to vote \"as quickly as possible\" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.\nGilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.\n\"We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,\" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.\nThe society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 pounds in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.", "Misys, Britain's fast-growing, 950 million pound software supply giant, said on Wednesday it was looking at four or five international acquisition targets worth up to $30 million each.\nChairman Kevin Lomax told Reuters that Misys, which has snapped up software trading firms in South East Asia, Ireland, the U.S. and Europe, was keen on businesses that operated within a strong international financial services market.  \n\"They (possible acquisition targets) are worth mainly between $2.0 million to $30 million -- and we might do one, we might do four,\" Lomax said.\nWith 18.7 million pounds of cash and an undisclosed, but low gearing level, Lomax said the company had plently of headroom in its cash flow and borrowing facilities to enable it to embark again on the acquisition trail.\nSupplying software to banks and insurers has brought rich rewards to Misys. The group earlier raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- a 10 percent rise.  \nLomax said he saw the possibility of \"creating quite a bit of shareholder value\" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.\nMisys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to 12,000 banks and 4,000 installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.\nIn the last 12 months, its shares have almost doubled to 1115 pence from 567 pence as it systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.  \nLomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' PE ratios are comparable, he says.\nBut the stock slipped 2.5p to 1115p despite record results.\nThe company has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.\n\"Internal production is not meeting the time to market requirements that these companies have -- so they tend to look outside to other (software) products,\" Lomax says.\nOnly last month, Misys announced the planned $60 million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software.\nIn terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its next competitor.

In New York, the stock rose 37.5 cents to $26.875.\nThe market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.\nBarrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its $800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.\nBarrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below $100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.\nCapital costs should be about $200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.\n\"They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,\" Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.\nAt Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totalling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of $240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about $475 million.", "China's new hardline dictum to its people to battle hostile Western influences with puritan Marxist values underlines a poverty of ideas among an ageing leadership with declining credibility in a fast-changing society, analysts said on Monday.\n\"They don't seem to grasp that people have changed since the days when they had nothing else to do but to listen to lengthy party documents being broadcast on the radio,\" said one China analyst.\n\"Nowadays people have so many other activities they may just skim over the headlines and not bother to read something like this,\" he said, referring to a 15,000-character Communist Party document issued in official newspapers on Monday.\n\"Do the leaders not realise people can channelsurf because it's not just one television station any more?\" he said.\nChina's ruling Communist Party, in what it hailed as one of its greatest documents ever, warned against hostile Western ideas such as capitalism and parliamentary democracy, urged vigilance against pornography and profit and vowed to fight back with puritan Marxist values.\n\"If they are seeking to change the average Chinese in the street then this is not the answer,\" said one Western diplomat, describing the newest demand for ideological conformity as a rehash of communist methods practiced for years.\nChinese political analysts have warned that the inability of the communist leadership to move with the times and experiment with new ideas and methods to stir up popular support in a society rapidly being transformed by market-oriented economic reforms could have dangerous repercussions.\n\"A lot of people just aren't listening any more,\" one analyst said, adding that a consequence of this breakdown of communication would create even more distance between the populace and a leadership that is already remote and secretive.\nTo recapture popular attention, China's leaders might try to use more extreme propaganda tools, such as whipping up a potentially destabilising nationalist and anti-Western campaign, analysts said.\n\"We are looking at an ageing leadership -- many of the Politburo are in their 70s -- who are set in their ways and don't seem able to accept younger advisers trying to package acceptable ideology in new wrapping paper,\" one diplomat said.\nParamount leader Deng Xiaoping had missed an opportunity to appoint a younger leadership when he purged the upper echelons after the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, analysts and diplomats said.\nAnalysts said that while the latest communist creed tried to present itself as a balanced dictum, it was clearly intended to achieve the goal of conformity of thought.\n\"It's pretty much a blueprint for censors to do what they want,\" said one diplomat.\nEven conservative newspaper editors appointed in recent years as replacements to more liberal writers have been purged in recent weeks, a succession of books have been ordered off the shelves and popular author Wang Shuo has been effectively banned.\n\"Things are only going to get worse,\" said one analyst.\nHowever, some doubted how effective a new purge would be.\n\"It's part and parcel of an attempt to take control of the way people think and the kind of cultural afairs that are conducted,\" the western diplomat said.\n\"But people don't always take as much notice as they once did,\" he said. \"It may not last much longer than the time it takes to read the thing.\"", "The United Auto Workers union is discussing the possibility of an extended five- or six-year contract with the nation's largest automakers, UAW and company officials said Monday.\nThe union is open to the idea of a contract longer than the typical three-year pact if it offers significant job security guarantees, officials said.\n\"It has surfaced in the subcommittees,\" said Carl Dowell, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville, Ky. \"There was no problem with a longer-term agreement if it's fruitful for our people. Job security is the key.\"\nContract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen.\nThe UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a \"strike target\" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies.\nA UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week.\nTraditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14.\nFord spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract.\nHe said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. \"It gives you more of a known quantity,\" he said.\nYokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers \"want to buy it.\"\nHowever, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers.\n\"The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?\" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant.\nSuch an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said.\nGM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs.\n\"You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,\" McNulty said.", "U.S. computer hardware makers are expected to report mixed results for the third quarter starting this week, as some companies are still in the throes of product transitions, but a few will have solid earnings.\nAmong the large system makers, International Business Machines Corp is expected to have good results, but Digital Equipment Corp is expected to report a loss.\n\"Product transitions and U.S. strength, those are some issues for the third quarter,\" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst.  \nCurrency will play less of a role than it has in the past two quarters, when it has had a negative impact on earnings, especially at multi-national giants like IBM.\n\"The negative impact from currency exchange rates is much reduced from June-quarter results,\" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, referring to large computer systems makers.\nEurope is still an issue for some companies, such as Digital, and this quarter will include the sluggish summer month of August, when many Europeans are on vacation.\n\"They (Digital) have significant exposure to Europe,\" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.  \nMilunovich said that Digital has more exposure in Europe, which has been \"a bit under water,\" than IBM. Digital recently revamped its sales force in Europe and made changes in its distribution channel there, to help sluggish European sales.\nProduct transitions are still ongoing at some companies, such as Unisys Corp and Silicon Graphics Inc.\nIBM has now completed a refresh of most of its hardware products, including its lower-cost mainframe line, the CMOS vesions of its System 390 mainframes and analysts are awaiting results of the first quarter to include any impact from the much-anticipated systems.  \n\"We expect IBM to highlight the success of its CMOS mainframes,\" Jones of Salomon said.\nIn the personal computer arena, analysts expect Compaq Computer Corp to again be the leader of the sector, but they do not expect a record quarter for the world's largest PC maker. Its strongest sales are in fourth quarter.\n\"I think the company had a good quarter and they probably gained market share,\" said Bill Milton of Brown Brothers Harriman, adding that it was a \"so-so quarter\" for the rest of the PC industry. Compaq has the highest profit margins in the industry and Milton said its margins should be up slightly.  \nAmong the weaker players in PCs, Apple Computer Inc is expected to report a loss, but analysts said they are more focused on the company's comments going forward. The troubled PC maker has previously forecast that it would return to profitability in its second fiscal quarter, ending March.\n\"Their first order of priority is to eliminate the losses,\" Milton said. \"Can they reach break-even by December or March?

Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.\nThe strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or fertilizer that includes steer manure.\nHealth officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.\n\"Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,\" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.\nAlthough so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.\nOdwalla, which bills itself as the \"leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,\" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.\nIn the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million.

Chrysler executives have suggested in the past they want to phase out the automaker's production arrangement with Mitsubishi.\nRichard Recchia, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi's U.S. unit, said in October 1995 the future relationship between the two companies would likely be based more on a partnership of components and engineering exchanges instead of complete products.\nThat is apparently changing.\nAutomotive News, a weekly trade publication, reported Monday that Chrysler Executive Vice President Thomas Gale took a team of executives to Tokyo in November to meet with Mitsubishi officials about extending the current contract through 2004.\nWilliams would not comment on the meeting. Gail O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi's Normal plant, said discussions with Chrysler have been continuing, with Mitsubishi considering numerous options.\n\"Talks have been ongoing, which is totally understandable based on the fact that the contract is coming up,\" she said. Analysts said it would make sense for Chrysler to continue to use Mitsubishi as a production partner.\nSince coupe sales have fallen off in recent years, Chrysler could use its own manufacturing resources to build products where it has a greater competitive edge, such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an industry consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"This way they can steer development dollars to some of their other platforms,\" he said.\nMoreover, if Chrysler were to move Avenger and Sebring coupe production out of the Normal plant, it would most likely have to convert its plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently builds the popular Sebring convertible, Neon, Cirrus and Stratus cars, analysts have said.\nRobinet also noted that Mitsubishi would benfit from keeping Chrysler as a production customer. Although the Normal plant has capacity to make at least 240,000 vehicles a year, this year it is only expected to make 184,000 units, he said. Next year, the plant is forecast to produce 175,000 units.\nIn addition to the Avenger, Sebring and Talon, the plant makes the Galant sedan and Eclipse coupes for Mitsubishi.\nAccording to Automotive News, Chrysler's products have accounted for 45 percent of the 177,707 units produced through November.\nChrysler was a 50-50 partner with Mitsubishi when the Normal plant, originally called Diamond Star Motors, was founded in 1985. In 1993, Chrysler sold its ownership stake back to Mitsubishi.\nLast year, Chrysler said it would drop the Dodge Stealth sports car from its 1996 model year line up because of slumping sales. Mitsubishi made the Stealth and imported it from Japan. The two companies continue to supply each other with engines.", "The head of war-torn Chechnya's oil company said on Thursday that Russia's rebellious region would guarantee the safety of a major oil pipeline across its land but demanded a cut in foreign deals that will use the link.\nKhozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company, which is based in the devastated capital Grozny, told a news conference that an $8 billion multinational consortium that will use the link to export oil in 1997 should not worry because the pipeline was safe and sound.\n\"We guarantee the link's safety,\" he said. \"But remember that with pipelines all over the world, things sometimes happen -- sabotage, technical errors, human errors.\"\nHe said Chechnya should get a cut from transit fees via the so-called northern link, which can carry 17 million tonnes of oil a year.\n\"The Chechen part is approximately in the same condition as the rest of the link,\" he said, referring to the stretch running through Grozny and linking the Azeri capital Baku to Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk.\nThe 13 international oil companies in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company plan to reverse the flow of the pipeline to ship up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of early oil from their Caspian offshore projects near Baku from August 1997.\nThe consortium is led by an alliance of British Petroleum Plc and Norway's Statoil.\nProtracted bloodshed and instability in the 21-month Chechen conflict have given the consortium the jitters ever since Moscow sent troops into Grozny in December 1994 in a bloody bid to rein in the breakaway region.\nThe oil firms, worried that exports from their big ticket investments could fall prey to a separatist war, have access to a second export route via the former Soviet republic of Georgia.\nUnderscoring the fragility of the region for oil investors, six foreigners working with the International Committee of the Red Cross were shot dead at a Chechen hospital on Wednesday and six ethnic Russians were killed on Thursday.\nYarikhanov, who said he had faced a cool reception at Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly, which owns and operates the pipeline, and at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, said Moscow was not doing enough to resurrect the region's once-glorious oil sector.\nWhile he said the pipeline was no worse for the war, Chechnya's production and refining facilities had been laid waste.\nAt least eight trillion roubles ($1.44 billion) were needed to bring the facilities back on line. Yarikhanov said financing could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya.\n\"We want our share of profits from the transport of oil across our country,\" he said, adding the Azeri group would pay $16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near Baku to Novorossiisk.\nThe Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir.\nThe Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into bloodshed.\nChechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow began tapping its massive Siberian reserves.\nRefining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22 million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased.", "Heavy losses in metals trading by a young employee at big Chinese conglomerate CITIC showed striking similarities to Nick Leeson's deals that humbled Barings Bank, a top CITIC official said.\nCITIC -- the China International Trust and Investment Corp -- had learned a bitter lesson from the 1994 losses and had stepped up its internal controls, group executive director Chang Zhenming said in an interview.\n\"There were a lot of similarities,\" Chang said of the CITIC and Barings episodes.\n\"We realised the seriousness of risk,\" he said.\nCITIC has gained a reputation of being one of China's best run companies, expanding its operations to power, telecommunications, banking and real estate. It is probably best known for its Hong Kong-listed unit, CITIC Pacific.\nIts big losses in 1994 were all the more surprising to many foreign businessmen.\nThe key figure in CITIC's trading was Chen Tongsheng, in his early 30's, who worked at the CITIC Shanghai office.\nLike Leeson, who was 28 when his big losses on Singapore's SIMEX exchange emerged, Chen was not a university graduate.\nHe had worked his way through to his trading position, taking a post as a bank clerk after finishing high school.\nAlso like Leeson, he is now in jail -- along with his supervisor, the former president of the Shanghai operation.\n\"Not only was the background of the trader similar (to Leeson) but so were the trading methods as well.\"\nChang said that losses stemmed from unauthorised trades on the London Metals Exchange, and that broker credits compounded the problem.\n\"He didn't have any money. He used LME broker credits,\" said Chang of the Shanghai trader.\nAsked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: \"You could say it was exactly the same.\"\nAuditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.\nBut unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson's, which neared $1.4 billion.\nChang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.\n\"We have stepped up our internal controls,\" he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo's copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.\nCITIC's subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.\nCITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.\nAsked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.", "Shanghai city is on the verge of renting out the former Hongkong & Shanghai Bank building on the riverside Bund to an unnamed bank but definitely not the Hongkong Bank, a senior official said on Wednesday.\nThe official, Zhou Jinbao, said final negotiations were in progress with two or three contenders for the huge building, built in 1925 as a symbol of the financial might of the British Empire.\n\"I will invite you to the signing ceremony. It will be held very soon,\" Zhou, general manager of the Bund Buildings Transformation Corp, said in an interview. \"The basic issues have now been basically agreed upon.\"\nHe declined to say which companies were in the final running but said he expected the winner to be a bank.\n\"It is not the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,\" he added.\nThe Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, had more than two years of discussions with Shanghai city officials on terms for resuming control of their former headquarters but finally announced that they had decided not to proceed with the proposal.\nZhou said the Hongkong Bank had wanted to demolish several buildings behind the main structure and erect a modern office tower.\nBut he said this proposal would have had an impact on wider development plans for the area which have not yet been fixed and are unlikely to be finalised for at least another year or two.\nThe main building has 24,000 square metres of space and Zhou said he was looking at around three U.S. dollars per square metre per day in rental. The lease can be for any period up to 30 or 40 years.\n\"The rental fee we are looking for is based on the fact the Bund should be the highest priced piece of land (in Shanghai). If other buildings are currently renting for two dollars a day (per square metre), then this building should be three dollars,\" he said.\nAt that price, the monthly rental fee for the building would be over $2 million per month. Renovation costs, he estimated, would cost around $15 million.\nThe building is steeped in history. After serving in effect as the East Asian financial headquarters of western imperialism for a quarter of century, it became after 1949 the Communist Party's Shanghai headquarters and city hall.\nThe city officials finally moved into a new building last year, leaving the old bank empty and echoing, waiting for a new tenant.\nThe main banking hall, with its magnificent marble pillars and curved glass roof, has had its banking counters removed and the murals which adorned the main domed entrance hall have been painted over.\nThe room just off the hall which served as the bank's general manager's office and later the office of a succession of Shanghai city Communist Party chiefs, is small and airless.\n\"This building has not only huge architectural value, but also great cultural and historical significance,\" said Zhou. \"That is why we will only rent it. We will not sell it. It is a treasure.\"", "Even before the personal computer era's foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry's annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.\nAlthough the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year's show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.\nThe week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.\nThe latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.\nNot only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.\nAlthough the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.\n\"I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision,\" Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.\nSony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.\nThe opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp.

A spokesman said the device contained just a few ounces (under 100 grams) of explosive and was probably simply intended to sow panic.\nAt least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to march organisers.\nNational Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.\n\"When you're abducted you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,\" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.\nSantos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.\nIn a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.\nThe women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.\nAn estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march.

Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said at a press conference both sides were \"happy\" with the deal, which has been completed.\nRewey said Ford, which occupies about 650,000 square feet in two of the center's four towers, had planned to stay in its location through 2005 when its leases expire.\n\"Our plans got changed -- by the new landlord,\" he said.\nMost of the employees, who work in the Ford, Lincoln-Mercury and Customer Service Divisions, will be relocated to Ford's existing Regent Court building near the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.\nRewey said Ford was not pressured by GM to leave early, but decided to do so because it now has space to relocate workers as a result of its ongoing Ford 2000 reorganization.\nRewey declined to say if GM will pay any of Ford's relocation costs. Those expenses could be substantial because Ford's customer assistance and business assistance centres are computer-intensive, technically sophisticated operations.\nEmployees will begin moving by mid-1997 and should be out of the Renaissance Centre by the end of 1998.\nFearing his urban revitalisation efforts could be hurt, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer had encouraged Ford to stay in downtown Detroit. But Rewey said Ford could not find a suitable downtown location that would allow it to replicate the efficiencies it now enjoys at the Renaissance Centre.\nHe noted Ford is encouraging its outside advertising agencies and accounting suppliers to remain in Detroit.\nFord officials took pains Tuesday to point out the company remains committed to the resurgence of Detroit. Included in that is a $25 million renovation of the former Veterans Memorial Building late next summer that will serve as the new UAW-Ford Training Centre.\nIn October, Ford agreed to pay $40 million for naming rights to a new downtown stadium for the Detroit Lions professional football team.\nBut some local real estate observers said Ford's decision to leave Detroit does not bode well for the city, which is losing a long-time and prominent tenant. Even though GM will fill the space Ford is vacating, there is still a surplus of class A office space, said Joel Feldman, a broker and market analyst at Friedman Real Estate Group Inc. in Farmington Hills, Mich.\n\"It lessens the possibility that current vacant class A space will be able to fill up, and the spill-over effect on class B office space is diminished because of this,\" he said.\nFord's history with the Renaissance Centre dates back to 1972 when then Chairman Henry Ford II announced the Renaissance Centre development project, which was designed to attract business and employment that would lead to the revitalisation of downtown Detroit.\nFord said its 35,000-square-foot World of Ford exhibition and display area at Renaissance Centre will be discontinued in June 1997. Company officials said they are not sure where or how the exhibit, which is popular with marketing and sales workers, will be reconstructed.", "World-wide Australian transport group TNT Ltd reported another annual profit slump on Wednesday, but promised the sale of its troubled airline and other reforms would produce strong profit growth in current year.\n\"We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,\" TNT managing director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.\nTNT's net profit for the year to June 30 fell to A$9.84 million (US$7.79 million) from A$40.01 million in 1994/95 and A$105.05 million in 1993/94.\nMortimer said a sharp drop profits from Australia's Ansett Airlines, 50 percent owned by TNT, and losses from its Brazilian operations and local general freight business offset good revenue growth in TNT's core operations.\nHe said profits from these core activities of domestic and international time-sensitive freight and logistics had grown 48.7 percent to A$165.3 million in 1995/96.\nTNT had moved to excise these loss-making units and focus on profitable core activities, he said.\n\"We've dealt with the (Australian) LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed, and we've sold Brazil,\" he said.\n\"What's the saying.... when in doubt shoot it or fix it.\"\nTNT would also look to sell other unprofitable, non-core businesses, Mortimer said. \"We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform, then they will be vulnerable to sale\n\"The inconsistency in our results has come from these fringe activities...it's that volatility around the earnings base that says we have to concentrate on core activities and get out of the non-core'riff-raff,' if you like,\" he said.\nEarlier this week TNT announced the finalisation of plans to sell its stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd for cash receipts of A$325 million. The other 50 percent of Ansett is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.\nTNT's remaining non-core activities include an airline leasing company jointly owned with News Corp, some shipping operations between New Zealand and Australia, a mono-rail in Sydney and some information technology assets.\nMortimer would not single out any of these as potential immediate sale prospects, but said they were vulnerable while they were not making profits.\nHe said the airline leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide, needed to have its capital base restructured before it could be sold.\nShareholders, however, took the profit slump in their stride, having actually forecast a slight loss rather than a slight profit.\nNet profit before abnormals, but after preference dividends, fell to A$0.6 million from A$38.48 million in 1994/95.\nAnalysts had expected a pre-abnormal, post preferences loss of between A$4 million and A$22 million.\nTNT's shares closed up three cents at A$1.47.", "Database software company Informix Corp. said Friday it filed a lawsuit against Oracle Corp., accusing its bigger rival of stealing trade secrets by hiring away its employees.\nOracle hired 11 Informix employees from Informix's Portland, Ore., research and development centre. All 11 workers quit on Wednesday morning, said Informix Chief Executive Phil White.\nInformix stock fell $1.50, or 6.6 percent, to $21.375 in active trading on Nasdaq. Oracle stock fell 87.5 cents to $39.625, also on Nasdaq.\n\"This is a blatant effort by Oracle,\" said White. \"They're behind significantly technically. We're not going to let someone who's significantly behind technically just buy his way in.\"\nOracle officials called the lawsuit \"ridiculous\" and said the 11 programmers approached Oracle on their own. They also had approached Microsoft Corp. about jobs, said Jerry Held, Oracle senior vice president of server technologies.\n\"This is a group of senior developers that was very frustrated by the lack of vision of Informix top managers,\" Held said. \"We did no active recruiting. I was called absolutely out of the blue\" when the former Informix staff joined Oracle.\nThe lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Oregon Circuit Court in Portland, seeks unspecified damages. Informix on Thursday also obtained a temporary injunction barring the former employees from giving trade secrets to Oracle, Informix said.\nInformix also charged Gary Kelley, a former Informix product development vice president who left for Oracle, with breach of contract. Kelley did not return phone calls to Oracle's Portland facility.\nInformix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and Oracle, based 20 miles north in Redwood Shores, Calif., both write sophisticated programmes that store and retrieve huge amounts of information in corporate computer networks.\nThe companies for years have been fighting a marketing war touting their advances in database technology with each new release of their respective flagship products.\nWhite said he believed Oracle was interested in gaining Informix's expertise in writing software for so-called massively parallel computers -- top-of-the-line machines that can process huge amounts of transactions simultaneously.\nThe 11 Informix employees who left for Oracle were working on this type of product, White said.\nHeld said Oracle does not have an interest in Informix's technology because Oracle is ahead in that area.\n\"Oracle has had parallel technology for years,\" Held said. \"Informix is playing catch-up. Phil has a knack for being behind and saying he's ahead.\"\nTechnology debates aside, the spat is the most serious between the companies in years. White, normally a publicity-shy executive, said he was livid about Oracle's tactics and intended to make the lawsuit a political cause in Silicon Valley for preventing employee raids.\nWhite said he personally went to the home of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Thursday night to discuss the issue, but Ellison was in Hong Kong. Both men live in the same small town in Silicon Valley.\n\"I'm doing this not only for Informix and for our shareholders but also for the industry,\" White said. \"We can't let companies come in and throw big financial incentives and walk away with intellectual property we spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing.\"\nIn recent years, several software rivals in Silicon Valley have accused each other of trade secret theft by employee snatching.\nIn 1992, Borland International Inc. accused a former employee of sending confidential electronic mail to new employer Symantec Corp... Last year, Cadence Design Systems Inc... filed a similar charges against direct competitor Avant Corp..\nThe court has set a hearing in the Informix case for Feb. 7.", "Supermarket group Budgens Plc said on Monday that it expected to open 10 new wholly-owned stores in 1997, as well as continuing to build up its presence on petrol station forecourts.\nIn a telephone interview with Reuters after the company announced an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 5.04 million stg, chief executive John von Spreckelsen said the group continued to be \"well-placed as a small operator in this niche where we are complementary to the superstores and the discounters.\"  \n\"The successful companies will continue to take market share from the less successful ones,\" he said.\nBudgens saw sales rise by 8.1 percent to 183.0 million stg in the 28 weeks to November, while on a like-for-like basis they climbed 4.5 percent.\nSpreckelsen said that sales growth in the run-up to Christmas slowed down as large stores pulled in trade, but had picked up again in January.\nShares in the group were virtually unchanged after the results, trading just 1/4 pence higher at 46 1/2 in early dealing on Monday.", "If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.\nThe Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.  \nThe section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.\nBoth the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  \nIn the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.\n\"Now the tables have been turned,\" Litan said. \"But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.\"  \nBoth moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.\nIn the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, \"is not material.\" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.\nCompetitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.\nComptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary \"basically eliminates any subsidization.\"\nHe opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. \"It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,\" he said.", "Toronto, Canada's biggest city and financial capital, is bracing for a near shutdown Friday when protesters hit the streets against deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.\nThe so-called \"Days of Protest\" on Friday and Saturday are shaping up to be the biggest labour protest in Canada since the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919 in which one person died and 30 were injured after a confrontation with police and the army.\nIn a bid to paralyse this city of 2.2 million people, organisers hope to close businesses and disrupt services, including underground trains and Toronto's Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport.\nThousands of unionized workers, civil servants and activists will picket outside the Toronto Stock Exchange, government offices, corporate headquarters and factories.\n\"I must tell you to prepare for days of inconvenience and frustration Friday and Saturday,\" Alan Tonks, chairman of Metro Toronto, said in a letter to residents on Thursday.\nIronically, the labour chaos comes as Toronto basks in the glow of being chosen by Fortune magazine as the world's best city for quality of life.\nThe protesters are furious with the government's plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.\nSince sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.\n\"We want to put pressure on the government and its corporate supporters that we're not going to accept this anymore,\" Linda Torney, co-chairwoman of the \"Days of Protest\", said in a telephone interview.\nPremier Mike Harris, who has been dubbed \"Newt of the North\" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, vowed the protests will not stall his \"Common Sense Revolution.\"\nCity officials were bracing for a disruption of Toronto's bus and subway services, which handle about 1 million commuters a day. Transit officials on Thursday won a partial injunction against picketing at subway stations.\nGO Transit, the train service that links suburban communities to Toronto, warned commuters that \"service may be delayed, adjusted, interrupted or even cancelled.\"\nAir travellers can also expect delays at Pearson Airport, which handles about 65,000 passengers a day, said airport spokesman Bruce Reid.\nA Canadian court ruled Wednesday that picketers cannot interfere with essential airport workers, but can set up informational pickets. Airlines have promised to re-schedule flights if there are significant delays.\nMeanwhile, several major manufacturers have cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday.\nThe protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week.\nThe Breeders' Cup, a major international horse-racing event on Saturday, will not be affected by the protest.\nOn Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community, traders not lucky enough to get a scarce hotel room are planning to sleep in their offices.\n\"Some essential people will be in the office. They might grab a couch or a sleeping bag,\" one broker said.\nOther firms are sending their employees to offices outside Toronto or telling them to work from home. Many workers are expected to take the day off.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest stock exchange, is planning a \"business-as-usual day,\" despite a large rally planned outside the exchange.", "General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.\nSpeaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.\n\"GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,\" said Licari.\nAt stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.\nUAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.\nBoth Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.\nBargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.\nBowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.\n\"I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,\" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. \"GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.\"\nGM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.\nIn settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the sale of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource more products.\nYokich has not said what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. He set the deadline on Friday, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.\nHowever, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if not enough progress had been made by the deadline. By hitting light truck plants such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wis., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.\nGM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.", "British Telecommuncations Plc, the telecoms giant, beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.\nBT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the second quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.\nBut after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) redundancy charge and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below figures for the same periods in 1995.\n\"The results for the half year show an encouraging position with sustained high growth in demand for our telephony services and significant sales increases in our new markets and advanced products,\" said chairman Sir Iain Vallance.\nBT, whose shares jumped 8.5 pence to 369 pence in heavy trade, has managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines over the last 12 months despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.\nThe group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.\n\"We're growing, we're not going backwards,\" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.\n\"I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world...When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.\"\nBT, which has formed six joint ventures worth $135 billion to gain access to the European markets, said it planned to \"get very aggressive\" in the next two years as the continental telecoms markets are opened up to competition, around 1998.\nAsked where BT saw the main profit growth, Brace said:\n\"All prices in France and Germany are very high compared with the UK. If markets open up and we compete, prices will come down. But we will take substantial market share, particularly in the business area where quality of service really matters.\"\nBT has operations in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. The firm, which cut another 3,200 staff in the first half of this year, expects about the same number of voluntary redundancies in the second.\nAs part of its European offensive, BT has won a licence in the Netherlands, plans to win both fixed and mobile licences in Germany and has bought into a mobile licence in France where it also thinks it will win the second fixed licence.\nBrace said high-speed digital ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines and overseas operations were growing at about 50-100 percent per year and that the company had high hopes for its intranet initiative with software giant Microsoft Corp, where it also sees booming demand.\nBT said on Wednesday that it and MCI, whose proposed merger is the biggest transatlantic deal in history, were linking up with Microsoft to offer transnational firms private communications networks based on the internet.\nAsked whether BT, which announced its $20 billion merger with MCI on November 3, planned similar deals, Brace said few other large communications groups offered the same prospects.\n\"I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with.\"\nAs previously announced, BT is raising its interim dividend by six percent to 7.9 pence. As part of the MCI deal, BT is also paying a special dividend of 35 pence which it expects to pay in September 1997 at the same time as the final dividend.", "St George Bank Ltd announced on Monday an agreed A$2.65 billion merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd - its fifth merger attempt in the past two years.\nThe merger of the two Sydney-based regional banks would create Australia's fifth largest bank, with assets of A$40 billion and a market capitalisation of A$4.5 billion, making its of Australia's top 25 listed companies.  \nAnalysts said the plan for Advance to pay St George A$100 million if it were taken over by a third party was seen as a way to ward off other bids, making it look like it was fifth time lucky for the St George.\n\"I think that would make it unattractive for somebody else to come in and make a bid,\" said Linda Lyon, banking analyst at brokers BNP Equities.\nSt George said it would offer an effective A$7.30 for each share in Advance Bank.  \nAdvance shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20 cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank.\nSt George said the total value of the offer was A$7.30 per share, representing a 20 percent increase over the average Advance Bank share price over the previous five trading days.\nAdvance shareholders will also receive Advance Bank's interim dividend, expected to be 20 cents, payable in February.\nSt George said it would also raise A$360 million in a new capital raising to help fund the bid. The issue would proceed upon completion of the acquisition, expected to in April.  \nSt George said the merger was driven by the need to lower costs and a review had found the merger could achieve a reduction of 15 percent in annual combined expenses or A$140 million before tax.\nAdvance shares soared over 10 percent on the announcement.\nAnalysts said that although there would be cost savings, the price was still fairly generous.\n\"My initial reaction is that it looks like Advance Bank shareholders are coming out of the deal quite well, whereas St George shareholders are coming out not so well,\" said one Sydney-based banking analyst.  \n\"It's a big price. I can't imagine anybody else coming and topping the price St George is offering,\" said BNP's Lyon.\nAnalysts said the offer valued Advance at 2.8 times net asset backing, well above the 2.0 times asset backing level at which recent Australian bank merger prices had been based.\nSt George has been desperate to have a friendly merger as it is seen as a takeover target itself.\nAustralia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), holds a 6.8 percent stake in St George.\nNAB has said it has no takeover plans for St George.  \nAnalysts said the Wallis inquiry into Australia's finance and banking sector might put NAB's acquisition plans on hold until the inquiry reported its findings in March.\nSt George's bid for Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped its offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC). Last year, St George was foiled in its merger bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd when Westpac Banking Corp made a higher offer.  \nSt George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd, before the Bank of Scotalnd Ltd took control, and the Bank of South Australia, which was takeover by Advance early 1995.\nSt George shares plunged after the announcement.\nAt 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) Advance Bank shares were 69 cents or 10.99 percent higher at A$6.97 while St George shares were 40 cents or 4.47 percent down at A$8.55.", "Derek Pretty, finance director of troubled U.K. discount supermarket chain Kwik Save, said on Thursday a radical shake-up of the group, including the closure of 107 stores at a cost of 87.5 million stg, was the best way to ensure its future.\n\"We researched opportunities in other areas and we reviewed, among other options, mergers. We looked at whether we should go back to being a limited range discounter, with much lower choice, and little in terms of chilled food,\" he told Reuters.\n\"But that would have meant losing nine million customers.\"  \nHe said the store closure programme would involve less than 200 job losses, as 90 percent of the staff would be redeployed in Kwik Save's remaining 900 stores.\nAbout 1,900 work in the 107 stores to be shut. \"Yes, we are confident that the provisioning is solid and appropriate. Anything more than that would have put us in the realms of big baths and contigency buckets.\"\n\"We have looked at this particularly carefully, the days of doing big bath provisioning have gone. We have looked very specifically at the stores we plan to close. We are confident it is the proper provision to take us forward.\" he said.  \nAt a news conference chief executive Graeme Bowler said the company would introduce a new range of chilled foods, health and beauty products and over the counter medicines as well as widening its existing product range.\n\"We are going for width rather than depth in brands,\" he said. Kwik Save will have 100 own-label products in its stores from the spring 1997.\n\"We are not moving away from discounting prices. It is our core proposition and we will not dilute it,\" said Bowler. \"We are not trying to be a mini-version of someone else, we want to be ourselves.\"  \n\"Kwik Save made its reputation because it sold quality products cheaply. We will not engage in selling cheap products cheaply,\" Bowler told reporters.\nStores will also be upgraded after research conducted by outside consultants Anderson Consulting, initiated in February, showed customers wanted stores to be more welcoming and easy to use, said Bowler.\nKwik Save would need to invest heavily in technology, where it was about two to three years behind the competition, said Bowler, so that, for instance, debit cards could be used at all its tills and stock levels could be better controlled.  \nHe acknowledged that the group had failed to invest enough in upgrading the fabric of its stores in previous years.\nThe new-style Kwik Save stores will be rolled out in geographical clusters over the next three years at a cost of some 300 million stg, funded from cost savings.\nThe 107 stores will be closed progressively next year.\nResearch had identified the need to beef up the management team and as a result Kwik Save has appointed a group marketing director and a supply chain director, and planned to appoint a new buying director, Bowler said.  \nHe stressed the underlying performance of the group remained strong, generating sales of seven billion stg over the last two years despite fierce price pressure from superstores, and a return on capital of 20 percent in line with the industry average.", "Shares in debt-mired Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA fell on Tuesday after they were requoted following a week's suspension amid disappointment over terms of its restructuring with creditor banks.\nThe troubled Anglo-French company unveiled on Monday details of the refinancing its 69.6 billion francs ($13.50 billion) of junior-ranked bank debt after a year of complex negotiations with bank lenders.\nThe shares closed down 8.74 percent at 8.35 francs on heavy volume of 20 million shares. They were at 9.15 francs when they were suspended on September 30 in the runup to the debt deal.\nAnalyst Jean Borgeix at broker Pinatton said the stock market was disappointed with the 10.40 franc price that banks will be getting new Eurotunnel shares at as part of an eight billion franc equity-for-debt deal.\nThe market had been looking for a conversion price of between 12-15 francs per share, he said.\nCurrent shareholders also stand to effectively \"lose\" 30 percent of Eurotunnel's future cashflow, as this is the percentage earmarked for paying the \"stabilisation notes\" it would issue to banks in return for an interest-free credit line.\nThe company negotiated the right to issue the stabilisation notes in case it fell short of cash to meet interest payments. It can issue up to 14.8 billion francs of the notes.\nFactoring in that loss of future cashflow gave the shares a present value of around 8.5 francs a share.\nAnother French analyst said: \"The restructuring assures the industrial viability of the project, even though the shares remain a risky investment.\"\nThe debt deal looked good on paper and the zero-interest stabilisation notes provided Eurotunnel with a last line of defence if its cash failed to meet interest payments, he said.\nA trader at a major U.S. brokerage in Paris said the share price suffered from the dilution of equity due to the debt pact.\nThe restructuring will dilute the holdings of current shareholders to 54.5 percent of the capital after the debt swap.\nThe complex agreement also includes issuing eight billion francs of bonds redeemable in shares, which could further dilute the equity holders to 39.4 percent if the banks exercised their conversion rights at 12.40 francs per share.", "A U.S. appeals court in St. Louis is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to reactivate or throw out a major Federal Communications Commission order opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.\nLawyers and analysts predict the FCC and its long-distance phone company allies will lose the latest battle to GTE Corp., the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators who want to overturn the order. It spells out how new entrants to the local phone business can link to Bell local networks.\nThe appeals court suspended the FCC order in October, pending Friday's case. \"The FCC faces a tough uphill battle,\" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. \"This case is headed for the Supreme Court.\"\nAs a result, the FCC's \"interconnection\" order is likely to hang in legal limbo for at least a year while it is fought over in court -- a prospect analysts expect will cloud the phone industry's outlook and weigh on phone company stocks.\n\"It adds to the uncertainty out there,\" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.\nThe order was meant to implement the 1996 communications law, which allowed local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others into each other's business.\nThe appeals court, in suspending the order, sided with the local carriers and state regulators who charged that the FCC overstepped its power by issuing national rules on pricing and other matters instead of leaving those issues to the states.\nThe court wrote that opponents \"have a better than even chance of convincing the court the the FCC's pricing rules conflict with the plain meaning\" of the 1996 law.\nWith the order expected to remain on ice for a while, lawyers and analysts said state regulators and federal judges will have the chief job of prying open local phone monopolies to long-distance companies such as AT&T Corp. and others.\nFCC Chairman Reed Hundt warned that piecemeal deregulation -- with judges around the nation ultimately deciding terms for opening local phone markets -- would have a \"very negative impact\" on industry efforts to raise capital.\nFCC officials have said the case will not be resolved before the high court until spring 1998, at the earliest.\nThe order requires the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at discounts of up to 25 percent.\nThe FCC also ordered local carriers to \"unbundle\" their local networks into pieces -- such as call-switching devices and operator and directory assistance -- so new competitors can lease components to complete their own networks.\nThe \"unbundled elements\" were to be priced at competitive levels based on the cost of new and more-efficient facilities.\nIn the meantime, state regulators have been issuing decisions on terms for opening the local markets. FCC Chairman Hundt said that despite the suspension of his agency's order, 29 of 31 states so far have adopted the FCC pricing policies.\nBut even those decisions are being challenged. GTE Corp. in particular, as well as AT&T, have appealed some of those rulings to federal courts around the country.\nHenry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, blamed the legal morass on Congress, saying lawmakers \"botched\" the job of writing the 1996 law. \"The whole idea was that the courts weren't going to be determining this,\" he said.", "China's top securities watchdog on Monday issued new requirements for exchanges and securities houses to strengthen risk control with the aim of cooling its over-heated domestic A share markets.\nBut the markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen responded with fresh rises in active trading with the A share indices hitting new 1996 highs, and analysts said the warnings would have little impact on the current active trading.\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in a circular, ordered the two stock exchanges to investigate the risk control mechanisms of their members, the Shanghai Securities News reported.\nAll securities houses must now display in their business halls warnings about the risks of trading on the stock markets, the circular said.\n\"The exchanges must quickly organise several groups to investigate the risk control systems of their members and report the results to the CSRC,\" it said.\nIt also ordered designated newspapers and magazines to report more on the risks of stock investment.\n\"Any comments on stock markets must avoid encouraging speculation in order to prevent investors being misguided,\" it added.\nThe new instructions follow dramatic surges on the domestic A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year.\nBeijing announced a new positive policy towards the stock markets in April, and since then Shanghai's A share market has risen more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart more than 250 percent.\nBy the end of November, China had 20 million retail investors in stocks, double the number at the end of 1995, according to media reports.\n\"The central government is concerned about surges on the markets which might be out of control,\" said Yuan Ji, an A share trader with China Guotai Securities. \"It hopes the markets will rise more steadily.\"\nThe surges apparently have been beyond the expectations of the securities authorities and, to cool the over-heated markets, the CSRC has over the past few weeks issued a series of new rules and punished many brokerages for irregularities.\nBut, despite the fresh warnings, Shanghai's A share index hit a new 1996 high of 1,312.295 points in the morning session on Monday and its Shenzhen counterpart a high of 486.22.\n\"Investors believe the authorities do not want to depress the markets, but are just worried over prices rising too fast,\" said a trader with a major Chinese brokerage. \"Because of this belief, the new warnings will have only a slight impact.\"\nThe CSRC in the circular also ordered local securities authorities to ensure the securities institutions have displayed the information by January.", "Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a crop analyst said on Thursday.\n\"We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help,\" another local crop analyst told Reuters.\nDistribution of rains was patchy.\nMost fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around Man, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coastal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.\n\"The front (associated with rain) is now over central areas,\" said one weather analyst. \"Central areas have seen a surplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit,\" he added.\nOne crop analyst told Reuters rains seemed to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.\n\"There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas,\" said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. \"There is no dust on most bush tracks.\"\nDry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had now retreated northwards after failing to reach southern Ivory Coast as usually expected in late-December or early January.\nExporters and crop inspectors said cocoa humidity levels remained around 8-10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent, despite drying efforts\nCoffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activity remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.\nQuality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.\nThe data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of January in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan:\nDalao 47.5 mm, Gagnoa 7.8 mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 6.2 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 4.6 mm, Yamoussoukro 44.8 mm, Aidjan 6 mm, Sassandra n/a, Adiake n/a, Korhogo 0 mm.\nNo data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.", "Hong Kong has arrived at the brink of history, set to name its first Chinese leader after a century and a half of British colonial rule.\nAt a gathering to be held under the red flag of communist-ruled China, Hong Kong's rich and mighty will meet on Wednesday to pick the first post-colonial leader -- and the smart money is on shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa.\nThe vote by a 400-member Chinese-controlled Selection Committee, slammed by critics as a travesty of democracy, was viewed by most in Hong Kong as a foregone conclusion.\nA survey by Hong Kong University showed 82.2 percent expected Tung to win, while 43.4 percent of respondents would back him if they had the chance to vote. His nearest rival, Ti Liang Yang, would get 27.9 percent of popular support.\nSovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.\nThe winner of Wednesday's vote by the committee will become the chief executive-designate of the Special Administrative Region of China, as Hong Kong will be called from next July 1.\nOn the eve of the vote a small band of pro-democracy protesters camped overnight outside the conference centre.\nSome politicians and diplomats fretted about China-style repression. \"The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him (Tung) to protect our rights...I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,\" said legislator Martin Lee.\n\"Unless there is a complete change in the attitude of these candidates the outlook for human rights in Hong Kong is very bad,\" said Paul Harris, head of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.\nBut the markets, a barometer of Hong Kong's fortunes, trumpeted bullish optimism. Hong Kong stocks rebounded from recent losses to end 198 points up, the index of China-linked H-shares soared to nine-month highs in the largest one-day gain in history, and forecasters predicted a 1997 property boom.\nPublicly espousing \"consensus\" rather than confrontation with China, and collective duties over individual rights, and blessed by a public handshake from President Jiang Zemin in January, 59-year-old Shanghai-born Tung grabbed 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee.\nHe only needs 201 to win the clincher on Wednesday. Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for Wednesday.\nIf he wins, he will be greeted by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics, in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco).\nGovernor Chris Patten has vowed support for the future leader, whoever he is, in the twilight of British rule.\nBut Tung has not responded to the plege. He has said he will consult Hong Kong's respected civil service on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.\n\"Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,\" Tung said on Monday.\nIf he wins, Tung will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy. His team is expected to be highly pro-business.\nHe will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.", "Executives from British Telecom Plc and MCI Communications Corp were on Saturday attempting to stitch together a $22 billion merger that would turn BT into the world's second largest telecoms group.\nMCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry on Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.\nBT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.\nAnalysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.\nThe deal would be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications market and the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.\nA BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.\nHe would not be drawn on where the meeting was taking place, saying only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.\nThe spokesman said an announcement was anticipated prior to the opening of the London stock market on Monday. Sources close to the talks said no announcement was likely on Saturday.\nBT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated.\nBT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable & Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.\nAny BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.\nAnalysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&T.\nIts critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.\n\"This is AT&T Corp's worst nightmare,\" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.\nAT&T said late on Friday that it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.\n\"We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,\" it said.\nHowever, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.\nFor its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said on Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.\nOne potential problem is a media joint venture between MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. BT would end up with MCI's 13 percent non-voting stake in News Corp and this could cause regulatory difficulties in Britain.\nBritish telecoms watchdog Oftel recently banned a joint advertising campaign between BT and satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a company in which News Corp is the main shareholder.", "Delayed export financing is slowing Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals but shipments for existing contracts will continue ahead of an imminent government decision on licences and marketing rates, exporters and shipping sources said on Friday.\n\"The central bank has stopped backing private lenders,\" said one exporter. \"Buying activity has slowed down in the past two days.\"\nNo immediate figures on  latest arrivals were available on Friday.\nAt least one major bank has stopped financing, and exporters expect others to follow suit unless rates are published soon.\n\"Exporters with licences from 1995/96 and enough money are carrying on buying and shipping. November contracts are fewer than December but still have to be met,\" said one exporter.\nIvory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24 but delayed an announcemement on guideline buyer and exporter marketing rates. \"They have never been so late,\" said an exporter.\nAlmost no cocoa trucking activity was visible at Abidjan on Friday. But large consignments of cocoa can be seen in warehouses and total port stocks are now estimated by shippers to be over 100,000 tonnes.\nOne banker financing some large exporters said many of their clients had no cocoa in port and the owner of the stocks was not clear. A large shipment to Amsterdam from Ivory Coast is expected within two weeks.\n\"Port stocks will probably slip before cocoa arrivals pick up after licensing,\" said one exporter. \"Activity will probably pick up after November 15 when licence finances have been sorted out.\"\nExporters are expecting total arrivals for November of between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes, rising to a December peak before a slow January tail-off. Exporters' total year crop estimates pivot around 900,000 tonnes.\nShipping companies expected licences to be out by Friday but are now waiting for an announcement next week.  \"Many companies we deal with were saying licences would be out by the weekend but we have heard nothing about rates,\" said one source.\nLicences are usually announced by the Ministry of Agriculture but no date has been set.\nCaistab sources said this week a list of approved cocoa exporters had been drawn up by Wednesday but still had to be signed by the Minister of Commerce. The list had been expected by exporters on Wednesday.\nCaistab president Yves-Marie Koissy is still in the U.S, but could return next week, said Caistab sources.\nExporters have rejected Caistab requests to them to argue for a cut in freight rates. They have also rejected a government plan to make exporters responsible for collecting buyers' unpaid income taxes.\n\"The Caistab is also trying to get exporters to pull down freight rates but they (exporters) are refusing to approach shipping lines,\" said another port source.\n\"Exporters want the rates set the same, so their rebate from the Caistab is not cut,\" the source added.\nPod counters recently up country said large quantities of cocoa were seen along roadsides and moving through warehouses.\n\"November arrivals will be strong as soon as the uncertainty is over,\" said one.", "Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik on Monday, for the second week in a row, skipped a meeting with the Prague bourse's governing chamber, amid growing calls for his ministry to tackle problems in Czech securities trading.\n\"At two o'clock (Kocarnik) cancelled his participation in this afternoon's meeting,\" Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) spokesman Milan Vodicka told Reuters.\nThe bourse's Chamber, which has been seeking stronger ministry action to ease investors' concerns about market transparency, later declined Kocarnik's return invitation for a \"future\" meeting at his ministry.\nThe meetings had been scheduled to discuss taking tougher regulatory action to address concerns of transparency and insider trading on Czech capital markets.\nJiri Spicka, director of the Finance Ministry's banking division, told Reuters that Kocarnik was \"too busy with the preparation of the state budget\" and \"it was impossible for him to leave the ministry\".\nThe budget has been expected for weeks to go to the floor of parliament for its second reading in the session which begins on Tuesday.\nKocarnik then invited the 18-member Chamber to his ministry for a \"future\" meeting, Spicka said.\nThe Chamber later declined that invitation, an official at the office of Chamber Chairman Tomas Jezek told Reuters.\nJezek lambasted Kocarnik on Sunday for lax regulation of the capital markets during the annual national congress of the ruling Civic Democratic Party, of which both men are members.\nJezek told the party meeting that the reluctance of finance ministry officials to more strongly regulate the capital markets was \"absurd\" and investors' lack of confidence could eventually do major damage the country's balance of payments.\n\"The capital account of our payments balance is alreday unable to level with a growing deficit in our trade balance, and the capital market needs to gain back the lost confidence,\" Jezek was quoted by the daily Pravo as saying.\nJezek warned that poor capital market regulation might even force a devaluation of the crown if confidence is not restored.\nJezek is leading plans to set up an independent markets watchdog akin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), funded by transaction fees, by the middle of next year.\nThe finance ministry has balked at the plan, but Jezek is widely believed to have the backing of the parliament's budget committee which he has said will probably submit legislation permitting a Czech SEC to be set up in the first half of 1997.\nKocarnik has rejected criticism that his ministry is failing in its responsibility to properly regulate the system, and says stronger regulations would be \"anti-market\".\nStill, foreign and domestic investors have repeatedly called for steps to beef up the supervision of the Czech capital market, and the ministry has said it is considering its own plan to re-regulate securities trading.\nRichard Salzmann, chairman of the largest Czech bank Komercni Banka a.s., told Pravo that \"none of the more important groups want to trade on this capital market.\"", "Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus accused opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman of lying and losing his nerve as neck-and-neck campaigning for weekend Senate elections turned increasingly bitter.\nZeman made a thinly-veiled allegation that the BIS intelligence agency had tried to extract compromising material from his elderly mother.\nThe slanging match between the two leading antagonists of Czech politics began on Monday when BIS director Stanislav Devaty, a Klaus protege, was forced to quit over allegations of spying on a deputy prime minister and a subsequent coverup.\n\"Yesterday's comments by Zeman on a police state, or on the BIS as a political police in the service of one party, are a visible result of losing his nerve before the elections,\" Klaus told a news conference.\n\"I can imagine such words being said by a radical anarchist but I can't imagine them from one of the three highest constitutional officials of this country.\"\nOn Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.\n\"The political struggle should be a struggle of arguments and not an abuse of secret services for spying on political opponents,\" he said.\n\"During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians,\" said Zeman.\nSpymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the junior Christian Democrats in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago.\nThe BIS had covered up the operation by failing to report it to the cabinet and a parliamentary commission supervising the agency.\nKlaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, who is also agriculture minister, but on a former adviser of his who was director of a bank which collapsed amidst fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the state security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.\nDevaty was a member of Klaus's ODS, although he had suspended his membership to become BIS chief.\nAllegations of politically-inspired spying on both government and opposition politicians have surfaced regularly in recent years in a country where memories remain of the pervasive state security apparatus before communism fell in 1989.\nThe political temperature soared on Tuesday when Zeman said his 79-year-old mother had been visited by \"certain people\" trying to acquire compromising information.\nAsked about this comment, Klaus said: \"If this actually represents what he said then this is such an unbelievable lie that I couldn't bring myself to reply at all. It's pure lie.\"\nKlaus accused Zeman of running a negative campaign.\n\"Instead of programmes there are scandals and affairs which destabilise the state and damage our country abroad,\" he said.\n\"The BIS affair is a clear evidence that above all the (Social Democrats) lack, in contrast to the ODS, a positive programme.\"", "China's economy grew by 9.6 percent in the first nine months of 1996, but many urban family incomes are lagging behind, the State Statistical Bureau said Wednesday.\nChinese industrial output was up, farmers were on their way to a year of record grain harvests and the scourge of inflation had been tamed to a year-on-year 6.6 percent in the first three quarters, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.\n\"The development of the macro-economy overall appears good,\" Ye told a news conference.\nGross domestic product was 4.5675 trillion yuan ($550.3 billion) between January and September, up 9.6 percent from the same period of 1995, Ye said, but gave no details. China's GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995.\nThe average urban income rose to 3,249 yuan ($391) between January and September, an actual year-on-year increase of 3.4 percent, he said.\nBut the incomes of many urban residents are lagging behind as China's economy booms, Ye said.\nA survey of 35 major cities and towns had revealed that the incomes per family member of around 40 percent of households had declined, he said.\nSome of the decline was the ordinary result of the birth of children or the retirement of older family members, he said.\n\"The second kind of situation is when the level of income falls or the level of income growth cannot keep up with inflation,\" Ye said, adding such problems were the cause of the income fall in about half the families surveyed.\n\"The difficulties of some low-income urban families have been aggravated,\" he said.\nHe gave no explanation of the decline in incomes suffered by some urban wage-earners, but many surplus workers in China's huge and largely stagnant state sector have been sent home on minimum salaries.\nAlthough such workers are not considered unemployed and the state sector is highly reluctant to fire employees, China's urban unemployment rate hit 2.98 percent at the end of September, Ye said.\nThe number of unemployed in Chinese cities reached 5.3 million, he said, but gave no comparative figures.\nChina's urban jobless rate was 2.9 percent by the end of June, the same as the official figure for 1995, but state newspapers have warned that unemployment, a major concern for Beijing's communist leadership, could shoot up to 7.4 percent by 2000.\nOptimism over the economy and the success of a continuing policy of tight credit aimed at curbing inflation and reining in runaway growth has been boosted by predictions that 1996 will be a bumper year for China's hundreds of millions of farmers.\nGovernment policies had encouraged farmers to increase the area of land under grain, and grain output this year was forecast to exceed 480 million metric tons, beating the 1995 record harvest by about 15 million tons, Ye said.\nChina had set a target of 465 million tons for 1996.\nOther figures released by the Statistical Bureau also painted a positive picture of an economy that Beijing says is on target for a \"soft landing\" after years of breakneck growth.\nYear-on-year retail price inflation in the first three quarters was curbed to 6.6 percent, down 10 percentage points compared with the same period of 1995, Ye said.\nThe Xinhua news agency on Wednesday quoted economic tsar Zhu Rongji as forecasting inflation would be below 6.5 percent in 1996 and as saying it would be possible to cut it to six percent next year.\nRetail inflation hit 21.8 percent in 1994.", "Germany's David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman's bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm's quest for his second final appearance in two weeks.\nPrinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate.\nSeventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set.\nBut in the 10th game of the match, Henman's serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point.\nHenman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set.\nThe British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to.\nPrinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control.\nHenman said: \"I didn't serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn't really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office.\n\"I'm disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I've played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris.\"\nPrinosil said: \"I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me.\"\nDamm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week's march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played.\nVictimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich.\nFor Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches.\nThe former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings.\n\"I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I've never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level,\" said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.", "The British government on Wednesday published new draft legislation governing home lending institutions but a lack of parliamentary time might mean it will not reach the statute book before a general election.\nThe Building Societies Bill, if passed, would remove a society's five-year immunity from takeover once it converts to bank status if it, in turn, took over another financial institution.\nImmunity would not be affected by one of the new banks buying mortgage books or by joint ventures, however.\nThe draft received a mixed reception from the four societies currently planning to convert themselves into banks.\nA Treasury spokeswoman admitted that there was currently no slot for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda but added it remained hopeful an opportunity could arise in the New Year.\n\"The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,\" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. \"When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.\"\nThe Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($49.97 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government has not taken into account its \"serious concerns\" on the timing of the draft.\n\"Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,\" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.\nIf the bill was enacted, she said the Woolwich board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.\nIn contrast the Northern Rock, also planning a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.\n\"We are delighted with it,\" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. \"It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you cant ask for more than that.\"\nThe Building Societies Association also welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.\nBSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's \"thoughtful compromise\" on the question of takeover protection.\nUnder current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.\nSome societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.\n\"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,\" the Treasury said.\nThe Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary.", "Australia's second largest telephone carrier Optus Communications rang up its first annual profit on Wednesday and is on track for its sharemarket float by the end of the year.\nOptus, established at the start of 1992 to compete with Australia's main telephone carrier, state-owned Telstra Corp, reported a pre-tax profit of A$60.3 million (US$47.64 million) in the year to June 30, 1996.\nThis compares with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.\n\"After a tremendous effort during its first few years, Optus is now in a very strong position to capitalise on the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing telecommunications industry,\" chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski said in a statement.\nThe profit was within expectations. Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$65 million.\n\"I don't think the market will be disappointed,\" said one Sydney-based analyst. \"I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about.\"\nThe results reflected strong revenue growth of 36 percent to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96, with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long-distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday.\nOptus, 24.5 percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A$2.0 billion in revenue in 1995/96.\nThe Sydney-based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of 1996, Switkowski said.\n\"The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done,\" he told reporters after the results anouncement.\nThe float is expected to raise around A$1.5 billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to 40 percent of the company shares to be listed.\nOptus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange.\nThe Australian government plans to raise A$8.0 billion from the sale of one-third of Telstra in 1997/98, which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July 11, 1997.\nDespite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its 46.5 percent-owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision.\nOptus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million, which were mainly due to the start-up of the offshoot, which is spending A$3.0 billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services.\nOptus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A$1.54 million in 1994/95, in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its 1995/96 results.\nSwitkowski was coy about 1996/97 forecasts. Optus Communications was completing its prospectus for the sharemarket float, which would contain revenue and profit forecasts.\nHowever, Switkowski predicted that revenue from its mobile telephone business would exceed revenues from its long-distance calls due to strong local demand, as Australia has one of the highest penetration rates for mobile phones in the world.", "Disgruntled Czech opposition Social Democrats have blamed party chairman Milos Zeman for their poor showing in weekend elections for the country's new Senate.\nThey suggested that charges by Zeman ahead of the elections that intelligence agents had harassed himself and his mother had backfired on the party, which had been neck and neck with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.\nIn the event, the Social democrats won only 20.3 percent of the vote in first round voting held on Friday and Saturday. This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nWhile the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.\nVasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.\n\"The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,\" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.\nShortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.\nEarlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.\nThe Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.\nLow turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.\nOnly 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.\nThe Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.\nAfterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.\nZeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.\n\"When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,\" he said.\nOne Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.\nWagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.\nWagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.", "The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index reached its 50th record close of 1996 on Thursday and broke the 5600 barrier for the first time.\nThe TSE 300 Composite Index rose 8.01 points to close at 5598.82, surpassing a streak of 45 record finishes in 1987.\nThe Index also breached the 5600 barrier, setting an intraday high of 5601.88.\n\"It's just another record in a string of more to come.

The country now has 30 passenger carriers.\nAir China, established in 1955 and China's longest-running carrier, currently flies 44 international and domestic routes, Zhang said.\nFlights from China to Los Angeles would either be two or three times a week, he said, adding that the launch dates for service to South Korea and Brazil have yet to be finalised.\nThe airline, which has a fleet of 64 Boeing passenger jets, would also be taking delivery of three Airbus A340 passenger planes and two Boeing 747s in 1997, Zhang said.\nZhang said the proliferation of Chinese carriers in recent years had given way to cut-throat competition.\n\"Because of competition, some companies have slashed prices. For us, we have cut by similar amounts, \" he said. But he added that the company, given its long and proven track record, was more keen to conduct business based on reputation.", "British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan.\n\"I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat's institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale,\" Greycoat's chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters.\nThornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was \"ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value\".  \nEarlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14.\nMyerson's Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today.\nLast month Myerson said it was time to \"unlock the value of Greycoat\" as the company's shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997.\nHe said there was \"considerable support\" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat's assets and enhance shareholder value.  \nGreycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share.\nThornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. \"The whole market is moving in our direction,\" he said.\nThe share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.  \nMartin Poole, Greycoat's finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty.\n\"The novelty has worn off from the bank's point of view,\" Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost \"roughly 10 million stg\", he added.\nPoole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. \"There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,\" he said.  \nWhile Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.\nThornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.\nRather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or \"possibly more\". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.", "President Boris Yeltsin's surgery on Tuesday might be a heart stopper for some volatile commodities and currency markets, but recent history proves Russian oil and gas exports are unfazed by Kremlin dramas.\nTraders have seen tanks fire at Russia's White House, cloak-and-dagger power struggles and war in oil-rich Chechnya -- and each time, they say, Russian supplies of oil and natural gas to Europe and the Mediterranean have held steady.\nRussia is the world's third-largest crude oil producer and single biggest natural gas producer; its energy heats and powers much of Europe and is a multi-billion dollar cash cow for Russia no matter who sits in the Kremlin hot seat.\nThis time, with Yeltsin under the knife this morning for a gruelling, hours-long heart bypass, should be no different.\n\"Politics don't affect us,\" said trader Vladimir Solovyov of Nafta-Moskva, one of Russia's leading oil exporters.\n\"We are more interested in things like government decrees saying'export tariff introduced' or'export tariff scrapped'.\nYeltsin's surgery began against domestic and international worries that if the operation fails, Russia could plunge into political uncertainty that could hit oil and gas exports.\nWith about one third of Russia's 6.2 million barrels per day output exported outside the former Soviet Union, and with Russian natural gas keeping one third of Europe warm, it is easy to see why traders worry about supply.\nBut when Russian oil exports do fluctuate, it is on less dramatic events, like storms at the Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk, one-off government supply programmes to former Soviet allies and which oil company is flavour of the month with export officials.\nGas exports can fluctuate on occasional explosions in Russia's gas pipeline system, the largest in the world.\nAnalysts said that with domestic demand flat while the Russian economy recovers, exports will be stable near-term.\nIndustry sources said there is no danger of conservative officials playing with the taps while Yeltsin was incapacitated, but they said some risk-averse European buyers could insist on contract terms less beneficial to Russian exporters.\n\"Our partners could get worried and demand terms not as attractive to us,\" said a trade financer at International Economic Cooperation, or MES, another leading oil exporter.\nOthers said money, not politics, motivated exports -- and with domestic oil prices below world levels, it is not hard to make money exporting the stuff.\n\"We like good prices on world markets,\" Nafta-Moskva's Solovyov said.\nPolitical tensions in other major oil exporting countries often cause benchmark London and New York oil prices to leap over worries about supply disruptions.\nNervous International Petroleum Exchange traders swung spot prices in London when Yeltsin sacked maverick security tsar General Alexander Lebed last month.\nBut Moscow oil traders and analysts said that everyone should just calm down.\n\"This stuff (oil) is scheduled for export months in advance and it's technically very difficult to fiddle with the taps,\" said energy analyst Peter Houlder of CentreInvest consultancy.", "Fund manager Nicola Horlick's row with her ex-employer Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) continued to be played out in public on Wednesday as she admitted that she had been in talks with a rival banking group until several days before she was suspended.\nBut Horlick stressed that the talks with Dutch firm ABN AMRO were of an \"informal and preliminary nature\" and at no time had she provided confidential information about the business or colleagues.\n\"The talks terminated several days before I was suspended,\" said Horlick. \"My aim was always to keep the clients and the team together for the benefit of all.\"\nThe benefit of all included MGAM whom, she said, she had never intended to leave.\nHorlick, one of London's most prominent fund managers, resigned last week after being suspended amid allegations she planned to defect to ABN AMRO and was soliciting MGAM colleagues to go with her.\nThe suspension came just days after she had been promoted to be managing director of MGAM and since then her fight to be reinstated or compensated for the loss of her job has rarely been out of the headlines.\nOnce again the lure of the cameras proved difficult to resist on Wednesday and in a television interview, Horlick repeated her determination to clear her name.\n\"When you're faced with the fact that people are saying that you've done something wrong and you know you haven't you have to fight for yourself.

Punitive damages, assuming a victory for the state, raise the potential losses to the industry substantially.\nThe state last month won the right to claim even further damages under Florida's anti-racketeering laws, a legal precedent in the spreading courtroom battle against tobacco companies. State lawyers have said the racketeering claims could cost cigarette makers tens of billions of dollars.\nA lawyer for Philip Morris Cos Inc., one of the defending tobacco companies, said in a news release that ending pre-trial opposition had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.\nFlorida Attorney General Bob Butterworth hailed the action as victory and said the industry had made a major legal concession to delay harsh disclosures during a scheduled Jan. 24 hearing about industry marketing and medical research practices.\n\"I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,\" Butterworth said in an interview. \"They want to delay. It's their best short-term ploy.\"\nButterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in 27,000 pages of documents to have been presented on Jan. 24 but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in anti-tobacco lawsuits filed by 18 states.\n\"It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science.... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,\" Butterworth said.\nPhilip Morris lawyer Gregory Little said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during the hearing open to journalists. Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.\n\".... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs lawyers to once again trumpet their case...,\" Little said.\nHe accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters and polluting the pool of unbiased potential jurors needed for a fair trial.\nThe judge in the Florida trial, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida, last fall threw out 15 of the state government's original 18 claims.\nDefendants in the case, one of several such lawsuits brought by state governments scheduled to go to trial this year, include RJR Nabisco Holdings and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain.\nThe industry may receive another legal blow if a reported campaign by Brooke Group, parent of cigarette maker Ligget Group Inc., to settle Medicaid claims in a deal that could involve the exchange of confidential documents.\nLiggett was last year the first tobacco company to ever settle cigarette lawsuits in an accord with five states which had sued the industry to recoup health-care costs of smokers.", "Sun Microsystems Inc. Tuesday introduced its first network computer, the JavaStation, in a direct challenge to Microsoft and Intel, the dominant players in the industry.\nSaying the company was ushering in a new era of computing, Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy unveiled a sleek, charcoal-grey device, about nine inches by 12 inches, with no disk drives or slots or floppy disks, to allow access to networks of computers and the Internet, at a cost of $742.\nSun, Oracle Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. are challenging the computer industry's dominant \"Wintel\" architecture from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. with the new low-cost, low-maintenance network computers, or \"NCs.\"\n\"Today you'll see why the network is the computer and has been since 1984,\" McNealy said, reiterating Sun's mantra.\nThe JavaStation is targeted at businesses. Sun said the machines might eventually be offered into the consumer market by cable TV and telecommunications firms as Internet access devices, but it declined to say when that might happen.\nWith Java, software applications can be written in one language and distributed across networks and diverse computers and computing environments, from mainframes to minicomputers to personal computers and now to the new NCs.\n\"Java computing is going to be as powerful as the mainframe in the'60s, the minicomputer in the'70s and the PC environment of the'80s,\" said Ed Zander, president of Sun Micro's Computer Co.\nSun introduced three versions of the JavaStation. The lowest cost, $742 version does not include a monitor or a keyboard. The systems are aimed at corporate users of Sun workstations and host computers, but can also access Microsoft PC applications from a host computer running Windows NT.\nAt a news conference in New York, Sun executives said they did not expect the new machines to take the place of personal computers, but they also professed amazement at the news conference Microsoft held Monday.\nMicrosoft, with several major players in the PC industry, unveiled its own \"NetPC\" strategy aimed at driving down the cost of PC ownership, with new features in Windows for network management, calling it \"Zero Administration.\"\n\"I have never seen such totally reactive vapour,\" Zander told reporters. \"We must really have touched a nerve.\"\nMcNealy said it was simply a move by the \"old-line legacy Wintel\" trying to hold onto its position in the world. Wintel refers to the combination of Microsoft operating systems and Intel chips.\n\"People call it a PC on a diet, I call it a PC in a corset, with the strings pulled too tight and a bright red face,\" McNealy said, referring to the Microsoft initiative.\nBut even with all the hype surrounding the industry's latest infatuation, Sun executives and analysts were not expecting big sales of the NC, nor will the JavaStation become a big percentage of Sun's hardware sales.\n\"This thing is a small percentage of the total product environment, it will help sell more servers,\" Zander told Reuters.\n\"Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,\" said Evan Quinn at International Data Corp., noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.\nSun said the entry level model, containing eight megabytes of memory, will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, keyboard, a mouse and 14-inch monitor, will cost $995.\nThe company also said it will offer a JavaStation with 16 megabytes of memory, a mouse, keyboard and a 17-inch monitor for $1,565. The JavaStation also has a small operating system, the Java OS, taking up less than three megabytes of memory.\nWhile the devices are lower cost than the typical PC, which can range in cost from $1,500 to $3,000, Sun executives said their customers will save money as the costs of PC ownership for businesses escalate and are now estimated at anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 a year, per PC.\nSun said a JavaStation costs about $2,500 a year to maintain, or about $7,500 for three years, potentially saving corporations millions of dollars.", "Canadian gold mining giant Placer Dome Inc on Thursday announced plans to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region through takeover offers worth a total of US$600 million for two Australian-listed gold miners.\nPlacer Dome launched takeover offers for Papua New Guinea (PNG) miner Highlands Gold Ltd and a mop-up offer for its Australian offshoot Placer Pacific Ltd.\nIf Placer Dome succeeds with both bids it will have control of PNG's biggest gold mine. PNG's Porgera mine is expected to produce over 940,000 ounces of gold in calendar 1996.\n\"It (the takeover) recognises the prospectivity that we see of the Asia-Pacific region and our desire to take full advantage of any opportunities that exist here,\" said Placer Dome's chief executive officer John Willson.\nHowever, there were no plans to acquire more assets in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. However, Placer Pacific has stepped up its exploration activity in Asia in recent years with programmes in China, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nThe takeover bids were well received by investors on the Australian share market, with both Highlands and Placer Pacific shares soaring in active trade on the bid announcements, which were made before Thursday's market open.\nHowever, the bids were not so welcomed by Highlands, which said Placer Dome's offer of 75 cents (US$0.61) for each Highlands shares was inadequate. However, Placer Pacific was more coy, it advised shareholders to take no action on the bid.\nThe Sydney-based Placer Pacific was partly floated in 1986 by its parent, which in turn now plans to buy-out the rest of the 24.6 percent it does not own through a share swap of one Placer Dome share for every 15 Placer Pacific shares.\nPlacer Dome, a Vancouver-based miner and one of the world's top three gold producers, plans to finance its A$425 million Highlands purchase through the issue of prefered shares.\n\"When we are done with this acquisition assuming it goes ahead, we will have debt of about US$1.0 billion and equity of US$1.7 billion,\" Willson said\n\"We will then refinance the Highlands gold purchase through a preferred share issue and we look at asset sales to bring our equity close to US$2.0 billion and with debt below $1.0 billion, we will be well within our range on a debt-to-equity basis.\"\nHighlands has stakes in two potentially large mining projects in PNG. The Nena/Frieda River copper/gold project and the Ramu nickel-cobalt deposit, both projects are estimated to cost a total of US$1.5 billion to develop.\nIn regards to Highlands non-gold assets, Willson said: \"We don't know much about them or what we are going to do with them, to develop them, sell them, or swap them.\"\nAustralian gold analysts said the Canadian gold miner was likely to succeed with its two bids. \"I think they will walk it in,\" said David Kauler, gold mining analyst at ANZ Securities.\nAnalysts said the offers are probably opportunistic, given that Placer Pacific and Highlands share prices were both earlier this year above Placer Dome's offer prices. But both have fallen with the gold price, which is currently around 2-1/2 year lows.\nHighlands shares closed 17 cents or 29 percent higher at 75 cents, Placer Dome has amassed a 33 percent stake in Highlands over the past two days.

But he brings with him useful experience in television from a stint on the board of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.\nC&W, is mainly a telecommunications business and has little previous experience in television.\nBut one analyst gave the appointment a lukewarm reception.\n\"It's not an obvious choice,\" said the analyst. \"He strikes me as very competent, but does he know anything about the cable business? I'm not quite sure why they didn't go for one of the insiders. There were some strong people, I thought.\"\nAlthough C&W's shares were languishing 2.5 pence lower at 485.5 pence in late afternoon trade, NYNEX CableComms saw its shares rise 5.5 pence to 108.5 pence.\nWith C&W, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, planning to finalise the cable merger in spring, the lack of a chief executive at the new company had fuelled some speculation that a clash of cultures was hindering talks.\nAlthough Brown conceded that the merger was complicated, he insisted: \"That is not true...There's a great deal of activity and we really are right on track.\n\"There is an exciting spirit of cooperation to bring this to reality,\" he said.\nBrown, who will take the chair of the company, tipped to be worth 5.0 billion pounds ($8.36 billion), said a finance director would be the next announcement.\nThe proposed cable merger was announced last October -- and most such deals spell job cuts.\nAlthough Brown said he was not legally allowed to comment ahead of Cable and Wireless Communications's planned listing in London and New York, he warned that the new group would \"clearly\" reap efficiencies.\n\"I cannot quantify what that is going to be, but we are working on that and we will achieve that,\" he said.\nCable and Wireless Communications, which will be well-placed to compete against dominant telecoms company British Telecommunications, will provide local, national and international data and mobile telecommunications with multi-channel television and Internet services.", "Commercial sponsors have flocked to the Portuguese enclave of  Macau to back Sunday's annual Grand Prix despite fears that China wants to steal the show.\nFans of Asia's answer to Monte Carlo fear a Formula One track, recently constructed just across the border in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, will seduce sponsors and signal the death knell for Macau's Formula Three race.\nMacau has no special track with the race run through the enclave's twisting streets.\nBut the concerns have not materialised this year at least and Macau is festooned with banners, kiosks and giveaways from sponsors including French oil concern Elf, Budweiser and Corona beer, watchmaker Omega and Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama.\n\"Zhuhai hasn't really affected Macau because most of its sponsors are here for very specific reasons,\" said Stephanie de Kantzow, an organiser of the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix.\nThe annual event, about 60 kilometres west-southwest of Hong Kong, started in 1954 and many of the world's top drivers have cut their teeth on the tricky 6.2 km (3.8 miles) Guia street circuit. Double Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, and current Formula One champion Damon Hill are past Macau competitors.\nChina also insists it is not seeking to edge Macau out of hosting international motor racing.\n\"We won't affect Macau. Macau's speciality is in the Formula Three, our aim is to host Formual One and the GT (Global Touring) Rally,\" Yu Binglin, vice-mayor of Zhuhai, said in a recent interview.\nElf, one of the event's major sponsors, said there was no reason for it to pull out of Macau even though another race track has sprung up in China.\n\"Macau has a history of automobile racing. As long as Formula Three Grand Prix exists in Macau, Elf will be present in Macau. Business and selling products is one thing, sport is another,\" Michael Bonnet, Elf's director of commercial activities told Reuters.\n\"What we wish to build in Asia are several (motor racing) schools to develop young drivers from Macau and rest of Asia.... we want to find potential champions in Asia.\"\nElf sponsored a Formula Campus Challenge in early November at the China Zhuhai 1996 International Race.\nRoyal/Dutch Shell, which lost its bid as fuel sponsor to Elf in 1995, said it would tender for the 1997 Macau race.\n\"Macau and Zhuhai have their individual merits, like individual tenders. Macau belongs to our Hong Kong business (budget) rather than China. We'll try to do it next year,\" Albert Wong, a spokesman for Shell, said earlier last week.\nBut China, which is determined to muscle its way into the glamourous circuit of international motor racing, is expected to give Macau a good run for its money.\nZhuhai, just 15 km (9 miles) northeast of Macau, boasts a 4.32 km dedicated racing circuit.\nThe Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA) is conducting a study on whether its is up to standard for endorsement as a suitable Formula One venue.\nFIA is also discussing with Chinese officials Zhuhai's possible hosting of a Formula One race in 1997, a senior Zhuhai government said.\n\"What Zhuhai has done is that it has opened up a whole new area of sponsorship. People who hadn't sponsored car racing before seem to be coming to Zhuhai to see if there's a possibility of being involved in sponsorship,\" de Kantzow said.", "The engines have been started in the race to succeed Alex Trotman for the top office at Ford Motor Co.\nThe company Thursday promoted two long-time Ford executives into positions that will allow them to prove if they are worthy of occupying one or more top spots at Detroit's No. 2 automaker.\nEdward Hagenlocker, 56, was promoted to vice chairman from executive vice president, and put in charge of a new auto components organisation with 75,000 employees and revenues of $14 billion.\nJacques Nasser, 48, previously the group vice president in charge of product development, was named to Hagenlocker's old job of heading up Ford Automotive Operations, the company's core car and truck business.\nSpeculation has swirled for months about how Ford's board of directors plans to handle the succession of Trotman, who currenly holds the titles of chairman, chief executive officer and president. Trotman reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 in July of 1998, but the board can ask him to stay on.\nComplicating matters is the prospect of a Ford family member returning to a top officer's role for the first time since 1980.\nRecent reports have said William Clay Ford Jr., 39, a great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, could be named a non-executive chairman, or chairman, when Trotman leaves.\nBecause Hagenlocker's nearly three-year tenure at Ford Automotive Operations has been marred by slumping profits and a slow start for the redesigned Taurus, some outsiders have said his chances for higher office have dimmed.\nBut Hagenlocker, a reserved man who joined the company in 1964 as a research scientist, has also overseen the launch of the hugely successful new F-Serieswell as the new Ford Expedition full-size sport utility, which is expected to be both popular and profitable.\nEugene Jennings, a retired professor of management at Michigan State University, said Hagenlocker's being put in charge of the new parts organisation could turn into a high-profile spot that should not btion.\n\"It's the one thing that Hagenlocker needs under his belt to give him the experience he needs to run the company,\" said Jennings, a long-time Big Three observer.\nNasser has been at Ford nearly as long as Hagenlocker. Born in Lebanon but raised in Australia, Nasser first joined the company in 1968 as a financial analyst. He rose through several international assignments, earning a reputation as a \"no-nonsense petrol head.\"\nWhile Hagenlocker is stiff in front of the media, Nasser moves easily among reporters, entertaining them with colourful stories about cricket and his globe-trotting life abroad.\nWesley Brown, of industry consultant CSM Forecasting in Farmingtills, Mich., said Nasser's new role also offers him a chance to further demonstrate his abilities at running the company.\n\"It clearly puts Nasser in a position to take over from Trotman when he retires,\" said Brown.\nFor his part, Trotman was circumspect about the succession question. At a news briefing Thursday, he was asked if the board is actively working on the issue.", "China's former first lady Wang Guangmei auctioned her private antique collection on Tuesday and said she would use proceeds to help impoverished mothers.\nWang's collection, consisting of porcelain bowls and plates and a brush holder made of ivory dating back to the Qing (1644-1911) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, fetched 566,000 yuan ($68,000) at an auction at a Beijing hotel.\n\"My mother gave them to me.... They are priceless to me,\" Wang told Reuters.\nShe is the widow of former president Liu Shaoqi who died in prison during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nThe Sungari auction house had put the value of the antiques, some of which were Wang's dowry from her wealthy capitalist father, at up to 510,000 yuan ($61,000).\nThe collection was seized from Wang and eluded destruction by radical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The authorities returned some of her collection when she was released from prison 11 years later.\n\"They were at Zhongnanhai or they would have all been smashed during the Cultural Revolution,\" Wang said. The Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing still serves as home and office to many of China's leaders.\nLiu, China's former president, was deposed during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1980.\nWang said she had deep emotional ties to the collection but these were outweighed by concerns for those living in poverty.\n\"I would be reluctant to part with what my mother left me without a reason.... (but) my heart aches even more when I see impoverished mothers,\" the former first lady said.\n\"It shouldn't be like this. The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute,\" she said.\nChina has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say.\nIn September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to \"gnaw the hard bone\" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century.\nThe communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power.\nChina says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995.\nAbout 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday's auction.\nProceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said.\nThe fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said.", "Quaker Oats Co. said Thursday its profits more than doubled in the latest quarter despite a drop in sales due to lower prices for breakfast cereals and heavy spending on its struggling Snapple beverage line.\nConcerns over Snapple, which Quaker bought nearly two years ago for $1.7 billion, sent the company's stock down $1.75 to $34.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"The stock is declining because they didn't announce any restructuring in Snapple, and some people had speculated they would,\" said William Leach, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.\nOverall, Quaker Oats reported net income for the third quarter of $133 million, or 98 cents a share, up from $61.5 million, or 45 cents per share, last year. The latest's quarter's results, however, included a $133.6 million pretax gain on the sale of its frozen foods business and $23 million in pretax restructuring charges.\nExcluding these factors, Quaker's third quarter net income was 53 cents a share, which was well above Wall Street estimates of 46 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.\nChairman William William Smithburg said Snapple was expected to report an operating loss for 1996.\n\"Clearly, the biggest challenge facing the company is Snapple's disappointing performance,\" Smithburg said. \"The integrated sampling and advertising campaign that ended in mid-September generated some excitement behind the brand this summer, but we're still disappointed.\"\nWhile he declined to give a specific projection, he said the 1996 operating loss for Snapple likely will be narrower than the loss it reported in 1995, although the business will not generate a profit.\nExcluding goodwill and other charges, Snapple's loss for 1995 was about $6 million, according to analysts' estimates.\nSmithburg said Quaker executives believe Snapple can show a cash profit, which is the goal for next year. He added that results for Snapple could improve next year, even if sales volume were flat.\nQuaker said several alternatives were being considered for Snapple. Those options include making Snapple into a regional brand or perhaps selling the beverage operations.\nThe company said its overall third-quarter sales slipped to $1.44 billion from last year's $1.55 billion, which included $72.3 million in sales from divested businesses.\nTotal beverage sales fell 11 percent to $593.4 million, while beverage operating income dropped 43 percent to $34.0 million. In the United States and Canada, beverage income was $57.5 million, excluding a $16.6 million restructuring charge, down 15 percent from last year.\nQuaker said Gatorade sports drink, the company's single best-selling brand, had a 20 percent rise in operating profit in North America.\nDespite an unseasonably cool summer, which hurt sales of the drink, Gatorade is having another good year, Smithburg said in a teleconference.\nU.S. sales of Gatorade will hit about $1 billion by the end of October, compared with sales of just over $1 billion for all 1995. That is \"kind of an important milestone for us,\" Smithburg said.\nQuaker said U.S. and Canadian foods' operating income of $92.6 million, excluding a $6.4 million restructuring charge, was up 7 percent from last year. These profits rose in spite of price decreases in ready-to-eat cereals.\nSmithburg said Quaker's ready-to-eat cereals, such as Life and Cap'n Crunch, had a 14 percent rise in volume in the third quarter. Value-priced bagged cereals, which carry the Quaker name, are growing at more than 20 pecent.\nThe company said North American foods sales increased 2 percent to $687.3 million. International foods sales rose 9 percent to $152.9 million, with increases in Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. International foods operating income was $2.8 million, down from $3.7 million.", "The trial of prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan for the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government is expected to be held behind closed doors soon, a family member said on Tuesday.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court had yet to inform Wang's family of the trial date, the relative said.\nThe court was widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents.\n\"Only the people notified by the court can attend the trial. Others cannot attend,\" the family member said in a telephone interview.\n\"In reality, the trial will not be open...but the court will not admit it is not an open trial,\" the relative said. \"It tells a group of people to attend and calls this an open trial.\"\nA court official, contacted by telephone, declined to comment.\nIf last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement, was an indication, Wang's trial would be kept from public view, a political activist said. Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei's trial.\nCourt officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.\nThey have not given further details of the trial though one official said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\nWang's mother, Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who has no background in law, has said she would defend her son in court. Chinese law allows an accused to be defended by a family member.\nIt also states that only lawyers can meet detained defendants. Wang's mother was allowed to meet the dissident at a detention centre in Beijing on Monday because she was his legal counsel.\nThe dissident was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, Wang's mother told a Hong Kong-based group that monitors human rights in China.\n\"Wang Dan said he has not done anything wrong...He is very calm...and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,\" the group quoted the mother as saying.\n\"She is very worried about his health,\" the group said.\nIt added that Wang had back, throat and prostate problems.\n\"In the condition that Wang Dan is in, it would be difficult for him to hold out under another long prison sentence,\" it quoted the mother as saying.\nWang, 26, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted Wei Jingsheng implicated Wang.\nThe verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.", "Shiva Corp stock rose five points Wednesday amid resurgent speculation that it may be an acquisition target of a major network equipment player.\n   \"It sure looks like people are speculating that its going to be taking over,\" said Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson, who maintains a long-term attractive on the stock.\n   Shiva shares have risen nearly 14 percent in the last two days. By early afternoon Wendesday, the stock was trading at 53-3/4, up 5 points on the day.\n   Shiva declined comment on what it called \"a market rumor.\"\n\"We have had rumors like this before,\" said Cynthia Deysher, Shiva's chief financial officer. \"Our firm policy on this is not to comment on market rumors,\" she said.\n   Several analysts said signs of merger speculation were apparent in the stock's recent gains.\n   Cowen & Co analyst Chris Stix noted that Shiva was mentioned in a trade magazine gossip column published Monday as among potential merger candidates in the network industry.\n   The article, published in the November 11 issue of Communications Week, spoke of a possible tie-up between rival Ascend Communications Inc and Shiva, among others.\n   Stix said another factor behind the rebound in recent weeks of Shiva's share price may be the company's comments in public forums that it has a potential major contract win with a major telecom carrier it has declined to name.\n   The Cowen analyst maintains a strong buy on Shiva.\n   The stock hit a low of 38 in late September, following a steep three-month decline from its historic high of 87 reached in June, when it was a favorite among momentum investors.\n   Although enthusiastic about Shiva's business fundamentals, Johnson discounted any recent product announcements as the cause behind the recent share price moves.\n  \"This doesn't appear to me that its product-related. It's too violent,\" he said. \"It's not valuation-related either.\"\n   Analysts consider Shiva one of two pure plays in the explosively growing market for remote access\ntelecommunications equipment. The other is high-flying Ascend, the dominant player in the market.\n   Johnson said Shiva might also prove attractive to any of the large data networking companies seeking to gain quick market share in the remote access business.\n   \"With a company in Shiva's position, I can't think of a company that wouldn't be interested,\" he said.\nJohnson said that Shiva, which by his estimates has 13 percent of the remote access market, may prove attractive to any of the major network industry leaders -- Cisco Systems Inc, 3Com Corp or Bay Networks Inc.\n   He left off Cabletron Systems Inc from the list of potential buyers, noting that Cabletron had acquired Network Express Inc in May to beef up its remote access line.\n   Shiva has carved out a strategic niche in the market for remote acccess products, which are used by companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to handle data communications over far-flung wide-area networks.\n   Shiva is the No. 3 supplier in remote acccess, behind Ascend, which  holds 40 percent of the market, and U.S. Robotics, a more diversified company with a 31 percent share, according to Johonson's estimates.\n   Stix said Shiva, in partnership with Northern Telecom Ltd, has the lead in a new type of network switching product that allows telephone carriers to address the growing overload of their voice networks by Internet data traffic.", "Russian diamond giant Almazy- Rossii Sakha (ARS) said on Wednesday officials were battling for control over Russia's lucrative gem sector but a forthcoming deal with De Beers was in sight.\nARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov told a news conference that a long-delayed trade agreement with the South African gem giant could be signed by December.\nBut he said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who could have a chance to sign the deal as soon as this week, would put it off until next month because of a government probe of ARS's finances -- a probe Shtyrov says may be part of manoevres among government officials for influence over the group.\nThe investigation and struggle for control over ARS come as the diamond company seeks more scope to export independently of De Beers. ARS supplies a quarter of De Beers output, nearly all Russia's diamonds and is Russia's sole authorised exporter.\nShtyrov said that under the trade agreement with De Beers, based on a memorandum initialled in February, ARS would have the right to export $180 million of gems a year independent of De Beers, or 5.8 percent of ARS's $1.38 billion in sales last year.\nThat could yield a rich trove of influence and power for whichever government ministries succeed in gaining the upper hand in controlling those sales.\nARS, which gave London investment bank NatWest Markets a mandate in July to raise $500 million in capital, wants to increase exploration and mining operations -- giving officials more incentive to grapple for control of the state-owned firm.\n\"We're very seriously worried about the recent accusations, which come at, and I say this in quotation marks, at an appropriate moment,\" said Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the vast Sakha-Yakutia region in Siberia where ARS is based.\nHe told the news conference he was referring to the impending De Beers deal and to ARS's plan to raise funds abroad.\nThe probe, which follows charges from tax officials and the prosecutor-general's office that surfaced last week, revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million.\nNikolayev said ARS had no tax arrears to the federal budget, and that Finance Ministry investigations into ARS finances turned up so-called insufficiencies but no major problems.\n\"They (the charges) are extremely debatable,\" said Shtyrov, adding that government questions over how to value raw gems supplied to ARS when the company was set up in 1991 were questions for accountants, not for lawyers.\nHe said ARS would defend itself in Russia's courts if it had to and restore its reputation with partners.\n\"If the result of all of this is that we lose our investment projects, then we will consider that Russia has lost -- and we will just eat bread and butter,\" he said.\nShtyrov, who is also vice-president of Sakha-Yakutia, said industry officials were struggling for influence over ARS.\nShtyrov said Yevgeny Bychkov, former head of the recently disbanded State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones, or Komdragmet, was still an influential figure in the industry.\nKomdragment was broken up by presidential decree in August and the Finance Ministry has assumed its functions.\nShtyrov said Russia's diamond sector would see stability, in spite of plans by some officials to give domestic cutters and polishers a greater cut of gem output.\n\"There are always rumours of a major shake-up and reorganisation of the Russian diamond industry, but they are not founded,\" he said.", "America Online Inc.'s new flat-rate pricing plan and moves to meet spiraling subscriber demand suggest it is on track to become a major media player, comparable to broadcast or cable TV networks, analysts said Tuesday.\nAnalysts cautioned, however, that underlying this success loomed a real threat that the online network's capacity to serve its more than 7 million subscribers could soon be overwhelmed.\nThey warned that the additional demand on AOL's network generated by the company's offer of unlimited usage for $19.95 per month imperilled its near-term capacity to handle demand.\nIf only a small fraction of AOL's millions of subscribers were to take up the company's offer of unlimited access and remain connected to the service for long periods of the day, the service would quickly grind to a halt, detractors said.\nClearly, investors are betting the company can surmount such challenges, as AOL has done repeatedly in mushrooming sevenfold from less than 1 million users three years ago.\nIn recent weeks, the stock's momentum has revived, doubling from a year-low of $22 to reach $44 earlier Tuesday. An afternoon sell-off caused the stock to fall back to $37.50. down $2.375.\n\"The market appears to have taken a very bullish view of the new pricing scheme,\" said Arthur Newman, an analyst with brokerage firm Gerard Klauer of the stock's recent run-up.\n\"But you have to balance this with the realisation that the more time users spend online, the higher the cost of adding capacity\" requiring new equipment investments, he said.\nAOL officials have warned repeatedly that they expect the next two quarters to be transitional ones, both operationally and financially, as the company seeks to gain revenues from advertising and commercial transactions instead of mainly subscriber fees.\nBut Abishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities, said he believed AOL had proven its capacity to weather the pressures of the explosively growing online medium.\nIn particular, Gami said AOL has measures in place to limit excessive connection times by users who now have little incentive to disconnect and free up network time for other users.\n\"Will this demand on its network be enough to destroy the company? I think not,\" said Gami. \"What the company will do is build out to meet demand and stage a comeback,\" said the analyst.\n\"Anyone who is writing this company's obituary is going to be disappointed,\" agreed Gary Arlen, an online industry analyst at Arlen Communications Inc.\nAOL said Monday it was greatly expanding its online network and planned to spend $250 million by next June to double its network capacity and improve service.", "The Supreme Court Tuesday declined a request by federal regulators and long-distance phone companies to reactivate landmark rules intended to pry open the nation's local phone monopolies to competition.\nThe denial means key terms and conditions for deregulating the $100 billion local phone market will for now depend on the decisions of state regulators in the 50 states -- instead of on uniform rules issued by the Federal Communications Commission.\nThe denial was a defeat for the FCC and long-distance giants AT&T Corp.  and MCI Communications Corp., which had sought to reinstate FCC rules suspended by a U.S. appeals court pending a legal challenge to the rules. Supreme Court Justice Thomas had declined to restore them.\nIt was a victory for the regional \"Baby Bell\" companies, GTE Corp. , other local carriers and state regulators who are seeking to overturn the rules in the appeals court in St. Louis. They argue that the FCC unfairly snatched from the states power to issue policies governing pricing and other matters.\nThe rules spell out how long-distance companies, cable-TV operators, utilities and others wanting to get into the local phone business can plug into local networks under the new federal telecommunications law.\n\"For all practical purposes the states have complete control over the prices new entrants will pay to share the existing telephone networks during the critical period when competition is supposed to begin in local telephone markets,\" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said after the high court's denial.\nThe appeals court temporarily suspended the rules last month, saying the FCC probably erred when it drafted them.\nOn Oct. 31, Justice Thomas declined a request by the FCC and its long-distance allies to lift the lower court's \"stay.\" They separately asked Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens to reconsider the request, and the justices referred the matter to the entire court.\n\"The stay prevents grossly arbitrary and distored pricing rules from going into effect and ruining the whole process,\" said GTE General Counsel William Barr. \"It does not delay the timetable set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for the introduction of competition, but instead allows for a more level playing field.\"\nOral arguments in the case are set for January. FCC Chairman Hundt conceded Friday it was unlikely the appeals court would decide in favour of the FCC, and he doubted that the rules would be put into effect for at least 1-1/2 years, if ever, while they were fought over in the courts.\nHundt was encouraged, however, by the actions of state regulators arbitrating connection agreements between the Bells and their long-distance rivals.\nHe said key provisions of the arbitration decisions issued thus far were similar to the suspended FCC rules.\nIowa, Texas, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania have been among the states that have issued decisions that will lay the groundwork for arbitrated agreements between the Bells and AT&T, MCI and No. 3 long-distance company Sprint Corp.\n\"There hasn't been any evidence that the states are going off and doing any wild and crazy stuff,\" said analyst Robert Mayer of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.", "Boosting the pressure on General Motors Corp. for a new labour agreement, the United Auto Workers union Friday set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against the world's largest automaker.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment that union negotiators were not optimistic that a new contract deal could be reached by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday).\nWhile he did not say if the union's 215,000 GM hourly workers would actually strike, Yokich said the UAW had notified GM that it will terminate its extended 1993 contract with the automaker if the deadline passes with no agreement. The union typically does not work without a contract.\n\"UAW members have been advised to continue to work unless notified by their local union,\" Yokich said.\n\"The UAW bargaining team will continue to make serious efforts to achieve a new agreement. While we are not optimistic, we remain hopeful that this can be accomplished prior to the expiration of the current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday,\" he added.\nThe move comes just three days after GM settled a contentious, 20-day strike with the Canadian Auto Workers union that caused parts shortages that are still forcing the auto giant to shut down some U.S. assembly plants.\nAlthough the UAW talks had been moving quickly before the strike in Canada, people close to the negotiations said the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand for employment guarantees and GM's desire for flexibility to shift more parts work to outside, usually non-union suppliers.\nBoth Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current work forces over the next three years. GM has resisted the pattern, saying it wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees.\nA GM spokesman said full-scale UAW negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters will continue throughout the weekend for the first time since the strike in Canada began on Oct. 2.\nIn a statement, GM chief negotiator Gerald Knechtel said, \"We remain committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.\"\n\"We've had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since the talks began and we're hopeful we can focus with the UAW on concluding these negotiations as soon as possible.\"\nMeanwhile, GM continued to run out of Canadian-made parts at U.S. assembly plants. In Flint, Mich., local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.\nThe facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components.\nBuick City is the largest of several facilities to cut back production due to shortages of parts following the end of the Canadian Auto Workers' strike this week.\nOn Thursday, GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown that will last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars.\nAlso on Friday, GM notified some of the 2,926 workers at the nearby Lordstown metal stamping plant they would be idled next week. Another 474 workers at a components plant in Vandalia, Ohio, will be idled next week, GM said.\nExcluding the layoffs that will start next week, GM said it had a total of 23,340 workers idled in the United States and Mexico on Friday.\nGM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after they ratified a new contract that puts some limits GM's ability to shift work to outside suppliers but allows the automaker to sell two contested parts plants.", "Archer Daniels Midland Co, which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its annual meeting Thursday from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.\n\"There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,\" said Edward Durkin, director of special programs at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.\nThe carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.  \nDespite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.\n\"I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,\" Lukomnik said.\nGoing forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.  \nThe chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.\n\"Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,\" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.\nA shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.  \nThe California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of that measure.\nCalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.\n\"Our primary focus is the proposal,\" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said. \"But I think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).\"\nOther proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed confidential voting for directors when there is no competing proxy.\nAt last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, \"This meeting runs according to my rules.\"\nDurkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.\nHe added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. \"There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,\" Durkin said.", "Cocoa arrivals at Ivory Coast's ports this season could be 25 percent below last season's record 1.2 million tonne because of erratic weather and insect damage starting in July, buyers and exporters around San Pedro say.\nThey predict cumulative arrivals to the end of November of around 250,000 tonnes and of up to 300,000 for December.\n\"Mid-December to February will dip because of the rains in July,\" said one exporter in the southwestern port. \"Harvests will now be later and more prolonged, but not over 900,000 tonnes.\"\nBuyers said heavy July and August rains hurt flowers for December and January pods. Sunshine after August had helped the outlook for March while lighter rains, which started in early November, would boost flowering for mid-crop pods.\nWidespread wilting of smaller pods was noted this week on on southwestern farms east and north of San Pedro last visited in September. Insect damage and \"black pod\" fungus had also been noticeable.\nThe Ivory Coast has slated 950,000 tonnes for its total 1996/97 output after private forecaster estimates of 850-900,000 for the main crop alone. The 1995/96 season hit a 1.2 million tonnes record after a higher than expected mid-crop of 200,000 tonnes.\nBut one San Pedro exporter said, \"There will be no more than 900,000 tonnes for the whole year. It could have been better but pod deterioration, insects and maybe even the trees' natural cycle have had an effect.\"\nLocal buyers and other exporters in the southwest agree, some putting the output at even less, but they say mid-crop predictions are unreliable.\nFew flowers and pods were seen on coastal farms and little cocoa was drying along roadsides. Tree pods and village stores were more plentiful in productive Meadji and Soubre areas.\nExporters and buyers in the southwest now matching cocoa arrivals data with last season's say volumes are down, with humidity higher at 8-10 percent and smaller bean sizes of between 93 and 100 per 100 grammes, against 85-90 last year.\n\"There is less cocoa than last year. It takes twice as long to fill a truck driving around the bush and it needs a lot of drying,\" said a buyer in Sassandra. Buyers elsewhere agreed.\nCumulative arrivals to end-November could be 250,000 tonnes, the sources said. One put registered cumulative arrivals at 213,000 to November 24, with 85,000 arriving in the week up to then. November arrivals last year topped 300,000.\nBuyers and exporters foresee arrivals of around 250,000- 300,000 for December against about 400,000 in 1995/96.\nA San Pedro exporters' agent said he had taken in 22,800 tonnes of cocoa this season with 10,000 still in stores and room for 25,000 more. Many San Pedro warehouses were full this time last year.\nAnother said their cumulative year-on arrivals were down 15 percent at November 24 and expected the gap to widen in December.\nSan Pedro's largest port handler expects up to 30 percent less volume this year and said arrivals to November 17 totalled 70,000 tonnes. The port expects to handle a third of this year's crop.\nCocoa quality is good but some mouldy, moist and deteriorated beans were being mixed in the rush to supply exporters.\n\"Some buyers can charge higher prices as export contracts have been sold up to March and have to be met,\" said one. Mould levels were around four percent, he added.\nSome buyers have supplied farmers with insecticides and say dry Harmattan weather moving southwards will help drying. One 15-tonne capacity dryer was out of action after a fire at a San Pedro plant on Saturday.\nExporters said they now accept the 1996/97 list of marketing prices set by the government this month after a late start to the season. But they said the Caistab marketing board had not altered its auctioning system to prevent overbidding.\nSmaller exporters say some people have been laid off until March as they cannot match prices bid over opening calls.\n\"About 750,000 tonnes have been sold to highest bidders but the Caistab has not sold the 15 percent it retains. Maybe they are waiting for higher world prices,\" one exporter said.\nA San Pedro factory said it aimed to process 25-30,000 tonnes of cocoa this year.", "The party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel.\nWith almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight.\nThe Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two.\nTurnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said.\nBefore the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house.\nThe Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.\nFinance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate.\n\"It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out,\" Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats.\nAnalysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business.\nIts supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus's free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition's loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June.\nKlaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform.\nScepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic's new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected.\nThe Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution.\nKlaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea.\nBefore the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate's legitimacy.", "Russia's diamonds could face a rocky future with tax officials seeking a bigger cut from rough gem exports, but industry sources said on Wednesday they hoped a deal with South Africa's De Beers would proceed.\nIn the latest shock to hit the Russian diamond sector and relations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, the prosecutor general's office on Tuesday accused Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS), Russia's largest diamond producer, of financial irregularities.\n\"Maybe it will affect the (De Beers) agreement and maybe it won't -- my personal opinion is that it won't and an agreement will soon be signed,\" said Pavel Kovylin, first deputy director of ARS's Central Selling Organisation, which handles exports.\nThe export body has the same name as De Beers's own London-based Central Selling Organisation.\nDiamonds could provide a windfall for the Russian tax authorities. ARS is the world's second largest diamond producer and its sales of uncut gems rose six percent in 1995 to $1.38 billion.\nARS, which mines nearly all of Russia's diamonds and is its sole official exporter, reached a preliminary agreement with De Beers' to export rough gems under a memorandum in February.\nBut the text of the agreement, undergoing review in various ministries, is awaiting government approval.\n\"The final agreement must correspond to the memorandum, since it was signed by the government and we are obliged to fulfil it,\" Kovylin said.\nThe prosecutor general's press service, which told Russian news agencies on Tuesday of the investigation, said it was investigating ARS' finances but stressed no formal criminal charges had been filed.\n\"At this point, there are no indictments,\" said press spokesman Natalya Vishnikova, declining to comment on whether formal charges would be pressed. \"We are investigating and the matter has been passed to the Federal Tax Inspectorate.\"\nThe investigations revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million, according to Russian news agencies. The probe has generated further uncertainty over the relationship between Russia and De Beers.\n\"There's a whole lot of political infighting going on between Moscow and Yakutia,\" said analyst Roger Chaplin at T Hoare & Co in London, referring to the main diamond-producing region in Siberia where ARS is based.\n\"It could possibly affect the agreement with De Beers -- but then again, it could be somebody in Moscow trying to throw a spanner into the works.\"\nThe diamond world, recovering from the decision of Australian producer Argyle to say goodbye to De Beers, is impatiently waiting for Russia to finalise its relationship with the South African cartel.\nRussia has been accused in the past of leaking hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of diamonds on to world markets outside its previous deal with De Beers. The new deal, once approved by Moscow officials, could give De Beers greater control of Russian output.\nBut it may not give greater comfort to Russia's increasingly ambitious mineral-rich regions -- especially to Yakutia, which wants a greater cut from exports of rough gems.\nRussia-De Beers relations were first hit by uncertainty when Russia's Komdragmet, the precious metals and gems agency which participated in talks, was shut down by presidential decree in August.\nUnder the February memorandum, which replaced an expired five-year deal, De Beers would take about 85 percent of Russian rough diamonds. That is less than 95 percent under the previous deal, leaving Russia more for its own nascent cutting and polishing industry.", "Mobil Corp, widely credited with the most aggressive cost-cutting program of all U.S. oil companies, is not resting on its laurels.\nThe Fairfax, Va-based oil giant told analysts on Monday that it has implemented $760 million of cost savings so far this year as part of a $1.3 billion plan and expects the remaining $540 million to fall into place soon.\nFurthermore, Mobil also expects to save at least another $300 million on an annualized basis by 1999 by streamlining purchases of everything from raw materials to computers.  \nMobil discussed cost-savings details after it posted a 10 percent decline in third quarter operating income due to a host of unfavorable conditions, including weak refining and marketing profits. A company spokesman confirmed the figures.\nIndustry analysts dismissed the earnings drop, saying Mobil's stock price had already reflected the poor industry fundamentals. Instead, Wall Street appeared more intrigued with the company's future cost-cutting plans.\n\"They have done an excellent job and I think they are determined to maintain the cost cutting,\" said Jack Aydin of McDonald & Co Securities Inc.  \nSome investors already have expressed concern about Mobil's ability to keep up its aggressive pace.\n\"People are wondering if they have squeezed everything out of the cost structure that they can and if their magic touch is over,\" said Smith Barney analyst James Falvey, who upgraded Mobil to a buy rating from outperform on Monday.\nChairman Lucio Noto sought to allay any concerns.\n\"Since we are in a very competitive industry that has significant price volatility, changes in the way we run our business are essential if we are to compete in the long term,\" Noto said in a news release about the company's earnings.  \nAlthough Mobil is not expected to announce a major restructuring plan anytime soon, future savings are anticipated from purchasing and technology.\n\"Everybody has cut a lot of the fat and even some of the muscle,\" said John Parry, analyst at energy consulting firm John S. Herold Inc.\nAnd Mobil is likely to soon start reaping benefits of its joint venture with British Petroleum Co Plc that calls for the merger of their downstream  operations in Europe.\nThe success of the joint venture will likely impact Mobil's plans for future savings as other firms also pursue similar pacts. Texaco Inc, Royal Dutch Shell Group and Star Enterprise are now exploring joining downstream operations. Star is a venture of Texaco and Saudi Arabia's state oil firm.\nIf other companies pursue such ventures and the BP pact is successful, analysts said Mobil eventually may seek a downstream partner in other parts of the world.\n\"I think the easy part of the cost cutting and restructuring has been announced. The key is going to be to remain on top of it,\" Aydin said.", "China's personal bank deposits, which surged in the past two years to stratospheric levels, have begun to grow more slowly as a result of two bank interest rate cuts this year, bankers and analysts said on Wednesday.\nBut the growth rate is still high -- more than 30 percent year-on-year -- and the huge deposits in the banks still pose a threat to the economy, with the possibility of fanning inflation, if the money is released into the market, they said.\nHowever, there is little chance that the deposits will be unleashed in the short term because the authorities are determined to maintain their tight monetary policy, they said.\nBy the end of 1995, individual Chinese deposits totalled 2,970 billion yuan ($3,578 billion), thanks largely to high interest rates set by authorities to drain money from the system and cool inflation, which hit a high of 21 percent in 1994, analysts said.\nBut the growth of the deposits began to slow down this year.\nIn the first quarter of 1996, individual bank deposits increased by 40.1 percent year-on-year, slowing to 34.5 percent growth in the third quarter, according to figures by the People's Bank of China, the central bank.\n\"The trend is changing,\" said a Beijing-based banker with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). \"With the central government reducing interest rates and supporting the securities market, some money is moving elsewhere.\"\n\"Despite the change, the huge amount (of deposits) continues to be a tiger in a cage,\" said another banker with Shanghai-based Communications Bank. \"If released into the market, it would pose a serious threat to push inflation up again.\"\nThe central bank sliced interest rates in May and August with the annual rate for one-year fixed deposits reduced to 7.47 percent after both cuts, from a very high 10.98 percent rate up to May.\nIn April, it also abolished an inflationary subsidy for long-term bank deposits of three years and above.\nThe cuts followed steady declines in the nation's inflation rate, which has dropped to about six percent this year from 14.7 percent last year.\nAnalysts said the interest rate cuts signalled a cautious relaxation of Beijing's tight monetary policy, begun in mid-1993 to cool an overheated economy characterised by surging inflation.\nBut Beijing will continue to keep a tight control on credit with the money supply remaining very high and the danger of reigniting inflation still present, they said.\n\"Experience since 1993 has proved that if we do not insist on tight monetary policy, high economic growth rates and the downward trend on inflation will be unsustainable,\" a central bank official said last week.\nChina's broad M2 supply increased by a year-on-year 26.9 percent by the end of September, slightly less than last year's 29.5 percent growth.\nBeijing has set the M2 target at 25 percent for this year.\n\"The problem can only be solved when macro-economic conditions allow a complete relaxation of austerity measures and when interest rates are further cut to the level (where) the deposits can be gradually absorbed,\" said an ICBC official.\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)", "British-based exhibitions group Blenheim is seen as an ideal fit with rumoured suitor United News & Media, share analysts said on Monday.\nUnited News & Media and Anglo-Dutch group Reed Elsevier have long been seen as rivals for the hand of Blenheim. However, industry sources said Reed was thought to be out of the running.\n\"Blenheim's strength in Europe and France in particular mean it would be a good fit (for United),\" said one analyst. \"The exhibitions business is also doing quite well at this stage in the cycle.\"\nDutch publisher VNU stirred the waters last week when it paid 500 pence a share to take a 15 percent stake in Blenheim. VNU declined comment on reports on Monday that it was set to increase its stake to 25 percent.\nIt said last week its 15 percent holding in Blenheim was a strategic long-term investment and said it had no intention of making an offer for the whole company unless rival offers emerged.\nIts move is certain to have concentrated the mind of United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who is now reported to be weighing a bid of up to 520p per share, valuing Blenheim at some 480 million pounds ($757 million).\nBlenheim shares closed 6 1/2p lower at 477 1/2p on Monday.\nUnited News has so far refused to declare its hand. Analysts said a complicating factor was the continuing reorganisation of its businesses following its merger earlier this year with television and financial services group MAI. United News also publishes two British national newspapers.\n\"A bid makes a lot of sense but the timing is not good for United News,\" said media analyst Nick Ward of Credit Lyonnais Laing.\nBlenheim, in which French utilities company Generale des Eaux has a 15 percent stake, posted pre-tax profits of 35.6 million pounds in 1995 on turnover of 202.5 million.\nFrance was its largest source of revenue, accounting for 37 percent of earnings, followed by 26 percent from the U.S., 20 percent from Britain, 11 percent from Germany and six percent from the rest of the world.\nMiller Freeman is the business magazines and exhibitions arm of United News. It operates in the U.S., Europe and Asia but analysts regard the American market as its main strength.\nAnalyst Anthony de Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon said a bid of around five pounds per share would represent an attractive deal for investors in both United and Blenheim.", "A U.S. forensics team has arrived in China to recover the remains of crew members from a crashed World War Two bomber recently discovered in south-western China, U.S. officials said on Sunday.\nThe team from the U.S. Department of Defence would focus on recovering and identifying the remains of the doomed bomber's crew, a U.S. official told reporters at a briefing.\n\"Our purpose is to recover all human remains and make the fullest possible identification of the 10 crew members on that plane,\" said the official, who asked not to be identified.\nOfficials of south-western China's Guangxi region would hand over the remains of the 10 men, aged from 19 to 26, who died when the B-24 bomber slammed into a cliff near scenic Guilin on August 31, 1944 while returning from a bombing raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan, the official said.\nLocal villagers looking for wild mountain herbs had stumbled across the scattered remnants of the bomber in a remote ravine last October, he said.\nU.S. officials first learned of the wreckage when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to U.S. President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\nChinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.\nChina's claim that the wreckage was found last October appeared to be true, the official said.\n\"There's no indication that it is anything other than what they said it was,\" the official said, adding that the Chinese government had given them full cooperation in arranging the repatriation of the remains.\nSome analysts have said Beijing may have known of the wreck for some time but has made it public only at a time when it is eager to improve strained ties with Washington.\n\"The Chinese see this as a humanitarian issue,\" the official said.\nU.S. forces lost contact with the bomber after it was forced to change course to Guilin because of a Japanese assault against its original base in Liuzhou, also in Guangxi region, he said.\nThe cause of the crash was still unknown and the forensic team would not seek to discover what brought the plane down on this trip, he said.\nVideo footage of the site seen by reporters showed five sets of dog tags, eight pistols, machineguns and other pieces of equipment recovered from the destroyed aircraft.\nChinese authorities had sealed off the crash site and the video and photographs suggested the wreckage had been untouched for more than 52 years, the official said.\n\"The recovery of small items, usually the first things to go, would indicate there has been no scavenging,\" he said.\nThe remains would be flown back to Hawaii next Friday for analysis and identification, he said, adding that it could take weeks to years to identify the remains.\nU.S. officials had made contact with representatives of all 10 families including at least one son, he said.\nA U.S. team trekked to a Himalayan site in remote Tibet in 1994 to recover remains from another U.S. aircraft that crashed in 1945, another U.S. official said.\nFrom 500-1,000 U.S. airmen remained unaccounted for after disappearing during World War Two flights over China, where U.S. aviators for years supported attempts by the then Nationalist government to resist Japanese invaders.", "Britain's Ladbroke Group and the U.S. Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) on Thursday unveiled an alliance to reunite the famous Hilton hotel brand around the world for the first time since 1964.\n\"We have been separated but now our companies are engaged,\" said Steve Bollenbach, HHC's chief executive officer.\n\"This will make Hilton the force to be reckoned with in the global hotel industry,\" Bollenbach told a news conference. \"It will eliminate customer confusion and benefit millions of our customers worldwide.\"\nHHC owns the Hilton name in the United States while Ladbroke holds the rights everywhere else through its Hilton International (HIC) subsidiary.\nThe two companies have signed an outline agreement to unify the Hilton brand, separated in 1964 when HIC was spun off from the American operation. Ladbroke acquired HIC in 1987.\nIn the alliance grouping 400 hotels in 49 countries, HHC and HIC intend to cooperate from next year on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and hotel development.\nLadbroke also announced first half pre-tax profits of 72.8 million pounds ($113.5 million) before exceptional items, a 29 percent increase on last year and above analyst forecasts. The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.4 pence per share.\nLadbroke shares added 7.5p to a 1996 high of 215p in early trade before slipping back to close 2p firmer at 209.5p.\nThe alliance gives HHC a larger presence in the international hotel arena. It offers Ladbroke a major position in American hotels and the chance to participate in the expansion of HHC's U.S. gaming business.\nThe companies plan to finalise the agreement as soon as possible in order for it to become effective by early 1997.\nBollenbach and Ladbroke chief executive Peter George said the deal would be worth tens of millions of dollars when cost savings and extra sales were combined.\nShare analysts applauded the alliance.\n\"The Hilton tie-up is more extensive than people expected. We are expecting big things from 1998 onwards,\" said Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson.\nHHC intends to acquire a five percent stake in Ladbroke once the final agreement has been signed. Ladbroke has said it expects to invest significant sums in hotels and casinos developed by its partner in the United States.\n\"We're putting our money where our mouth is,\" said Bollenbach, a former Walt Disney Company executive who joined HHC in February.\nHe said one of his first calls at HHC was to his Ladbroke counterpart George. The two men subsequently met several times and even shared a holiday, rafting in Idaho with their wives.\nUnder the deal, George will join the HHC board while Bollenbach becomes a director of Ladbroke.\nThe Hilton hotel chain was founded in 1919 when Conrad Hilton opened his first hotel in the Texan town of Cisco.", "Three Canadian financial institutions on Tuesday launched North America's first city-wide, reusable \"smart\" card designed to replace cash in retail transactions.\nThe Exact card will be tested under a pilot programme operated by Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canada Trust, a unit of CT Financial Services Inc.\nThe project will be in Kingston, Ontario, city of about 100,000 people located 168 miles (270 km) northeast of Toronto.\nAbout 600 Kingston merchants -- including convenience stores, gas stations and fast food outlets -- signed up with the test project.\nThe consortium is advertising Exact as an alternative to cash, credit and debit cards. Canadians currently spend between C$40 billion ($29 billion) and C$60 billion ($44 billion) using small coins and bills.\n\"With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,\" said Ron Hodge, vice president of card and direct services for TD Bank.\nCanadians are among the biggest users of plastic cards in the world. They carry an estimated 46.2 million debt and credit cards, while use of these cards has jumped 43 percent in the past year, according to a recent industry survey.\n\"Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more secure transactions. This is only the beginning,\" said Tim Hockey, vice president of core banking services for Canada Trust.\nExact will be followed in early 1997 by a community-wide test of Mondex, a rival \"smart\" card system developed in Britain. Exact is based on smart card technology developed by Belgium-based Banksys.\nRoyal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will roll out their Mondex system in Guelph, a city of about 100,000 people 50 miles (80 kms) west of Toronto.\nBoth systems are similar in that they involve storing money on a computer chip embedded within a card. When a customer uses the card to make a purchase, the value is subtracted from the card.\nCustomers simply insert their card in the merchant's special, hand-held purchase terminal. The merchant enters the purchase price and the customer presses the \"OK\" button.\nThe electronic value of the sale is collected in the purchase terminal and transferred via telephone modem to the merchant's bank account at the end of the day.\nExact users can load, or electronically transfer cash from bank account to the card, up to C$200 ($147) from terminals in the Kingston branches of Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust. Load terminals will also be located in shopping malls, student campuses and selected stores.\nThe card will initally be offered at no charge. But after an introductory period, each financial institution will set a fee for its own customers.", "French electrical equipment company Schneider aims to almost double its return on equity capital to 15 percent in the next three years, executive vice president Michel Staib told Reuters.\n\"Our objective is to have a net return on capital, before amortisation of goodwill, of 15 percent...in three years,\" he said in an interview. \"It's a reasonable plan.\"\nThat compared to just over eight percent in 1995, he said. The improvement will come from pruning down Schneider to core electrical activities and an internal re-engineering programme.\nSchneider shares have risen strongly in the past few weeks as analysts considered the stock undervalued and welcomed the pending sale of the Spie Batignolles unit, which has dragged on the group's results.\nThe stock has risen around 10 percent since mid-December when news of its Spie sale hit the market. The shares closed on Wednesday at 255.70 francs. About a third of the capital is in non-domestic hands.\nAll the group companies are profitable and with the sale of construction company Spie Batignolles, Schneider is at a \"diamond point,\" Staib said.\nStaib did not rule out further disposals depending on market and technology changes but Schneider is now well-focused.\nSchneider will seek growth in emerging markets, in South America and Asia, including India. It wants Asia to contribute at least 20 percent of group turnover before the end of the decade compared to 11 percent in 1995.\nSchneider has expanded its operations in China, increasing the number of employees to 2,500 from 200 five years ago.\nThe company also wants to increase its share in Germany from a tiny three to four percent of a market which Staib says is the world's third largest. Germany accounted for 2.5 percent of turnover in 1995, or three billion francs.\nIt will seek alliances with other industrial companies rather than acquire firms, as the Germany market is tightly held. Expansion in emerging markets will also be done through local alliances and joint ventures.\nSchneider last year bought out Daimler-Benz AG's 50 percent share in AEG Schneider Automation unit.\nSchneider posted 1995 sales of 59.42 billion francs and net attributable profit of 817 million.

This is the first year we've ever been caught up in a general market malaise,\" said Harvey Norman managing director Michael Harvey.\n\"It's basically an indication to us that the market is having its worst year since Harvey Norman began (in 1982).\"\nHarvey Norman, which is aiming for turnover of A$1.2 billion in the year ending June 30, has enjoyed annual sales growth of up to 58 percent over the past four years.  \nIt, along with other retailers, had been hoping for a strong December but found Australian wallets were not as easy to prise open as they once were, especially for clothes.\nAustralia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, which accounts for almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent, declined on Wednesday to give figures for December sales.\nBut corporate affairs director Peter Morgan said he was \"comfortable\" with Coles' performance. Coles has recently been among the most poorly performed listed retailers and is embarking on a major refocusing of its sprawling businesses.  \nOfficial data released on Tuesday showed that all areas of retailing except for food weakened in the three months to November and that overall retail sales continued to trend down despite two interest rate cuts since July.\nThe Reserve Bank eased rates again last month, but it was too late to rescue a second dismal Christmas for retailers.\n\"A shocker\" was how one stock analyst summed up the festive season for the clothing retailers, but she said supermarket chain Woolworths Ltd and other food retailers should have come through the Christmas period relatively unscathed.  \nAsked about the outlook for full-year profits in 1996/97, the analyst said: \"Pretty grim.\" But she and another analyst said they saw a pick-up in earnings in coming months.\n\"I think the outlook is reasonable, but not spectacular,\" the second analyst said.", "China has tightened safety measures after a fatal rocket explosion early this year and has found the cause of another launch failure in August, Chinese space officials said on Wednesday.\nFurther testing was needed for the Long March 3 rocket and that could delay China's launch schedule, they said.\n\"Launch vehicles will now self-destruct if there is a failure,\" said Zhang Qingwei, vice president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.\n\"We will also ensure that people (living in the area of space centres) will be moved away when we conduct a launch,\" he told an international conference on space technology.\nA Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after launch in February, killing six people and injuring 57, according to official reports.\nUnofficial sources have put the casualty toll much higher.\nChina's commercial space drive suffered another setback in August when a communications satellite failed to reach proper orbit after launch aboard a Long March 3 rocket.\n\"We have determined the cause of the August 18 failure and have taken corrective measures,\" said Zhang, adding that the problem stemmed from a faulty hydrogen valve on the third stage of the booster rocket.\n\"We are still conducting ground testing,\" he said. \"There will be delays (in the Long March 3) programme this year but this will not affect other Long March vehicles.\"\nAn official of the China Aerospace Corporation, which oversees commercial satellite launches, said a Long March 3 rocket could be launched by the end of the year or early next year.\nTwo other launches using the Long March 2D and Long March 3A rockets were also expected to be made by the end of the year.\nIn January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, killing six people and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.\nChina once enjoyed a reputation of being a cheap and reliable provider of satellite launch services but the string of failures has shaken its hopes of playing a bigger role in the commercial space business.", "U.S. computer makers are expected to report solid fourth quarter earnings in what is normally the strongest quarter of the year, but the stronger dollar will have a negative impact on some big systems makers.\nAnd despite all the negative reports from computer retailers about lackluster personal computer sales, analysts said most U.S. PC makers -- with the exception of Apple Computer Inc and AST Research Inc -- will show strong sales growth, fueled by hefty corporate PC buying.\nApple is first to report, with Q1 late Wednesday.  \nEarlier this month, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple Computer forecast it would report an operating loss for its first quarter, ending December, citing weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC and continued shortages of notebooks.\n\"Most of the indications are that business throughout the (PC) sector, other than Apple, was strong,\" said Eugene Glazer, a Dean Witter analyst. \"With all the negative comments you are hearing from retailers, some of that market was going to the direct marketers (like Dell Computer Corp and Gateway 2000 Inc).\"  \nAnalysts said PC leader Compaq Computer Corp is likely to report strong earnings, especially after semiconductor giant Intel Corp reported a blow-out fourth quarter, surpassing Wall Street's highest estimates.\nCompaq gets about 20 percent or so of its revenues from the retail consumer channel and the rest of its revenues are from sales to corporate customers, which were booming.\n\"The consumer business didn't hurt them,\" said Jim Poyner, an Oppenheimer & Co analyst. \"Dell and Compaq are benefitting from the same forces, the transition to the PentiumPro (chip), a hot notebook market and progress in the server business.\"  \nOn the larger systems side, companies like International Business Machines Corp, Digital Equipment Corp, Unisys Corp, are expected to see some negative impact from a stronger dollar overseas, plus sluggish sales in Europe, while business in the U.S. remains strong.\n\"Business is quite good in the U.S.,\" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst. \"Where it's slower, or where the concerns have been expressed is overseas, mostly in Europe.\"\nDigital is expected to report a slight profit, as it slowly recovers from sales force problems in Europe and a money-losing PC business. PCs are expected to break-even.  \n\"I think it will be a good quarter,\" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \"The dollar did strengthen at the end of the quarter.

A new date for the meeting has yet to be set, but officials say it will be \"soon\".\nThe trade deficit grew to a record 100 billion crowns ($3.68 billion) from January-August, the same as for the whole of 1995, and the markets are anxiously awaiting to see what, if anything, might be done.\nForecasts say that the current account deficit will also grow to around six percent of gross domestic product in 1996 from four percent last year.\nWhen Klaus and three cabinet members, plus central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky and Czech Statistical Bureau chairman Edvard Outrata, finally discuss possible fixes for the rapidly expanding gap, they will have heard plenty of advice.\nMany analysts say capital inflows can finance the deficit in the short term and urge moves, other than devaluation, that would gradually improve the competitiveness of Czech exporters.\nOthers suggest measures that could bring immediate relief, including import charges and fiscal adjustment.\nGOVERNMENT SHOULD AIM FOR BUDGET SURPLUS NEXT YEAR\n\"The reaction should come immediately, before the deficit becomes unmanageable,\" said Vladimir Kreidl, economist at Prague's Patria Finance.\nKlaus's government should not only pass its fifth straight balanced budget, but fight for a 1997 surplus of one or two percent of GDP. Other fiscal restrictions could be imposed to help cut domestic demand for imports, he said.\n\"Fiscal restriction is the most effective tool for reducing the deficit,\" Kreidl said, adding that the government should back private savings and a fully-funded pension system.\nSTRUCTURAL REFORMS NEEDED TO BOOST COMPETITIVENESS\nKreidl said more attention was needed to improve the capital markets which would strengthen currency inflow. Speeding up privatisation by sell-offs to strategic foreign investors would also boost competitiveness, he said.\n\"Czech exporters must become more cost competitive,\" said Jiri Huebner, Czech and Slovak team director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).\n\"There is a need for substantial investments in new plant and technology...to improve productivity.\"\nThe government has contended that many of the imports which are fuelling the deficit are modernising Czech industry, which should eventually produce higher export output, but Huebner said more targeted policies were necessary.\nHe advocated an acceleration of depreciation on new capital expenditures and relaxing tax write-offs of bad debts to spark The government must separate investment funds from bank management to ensure shareholders' interests are a priority, not the credit activity of the parent bank, he said. \"The government should prohibit bankers from the credits side of the business (from sitting) on company boards,\" he said.\nIMPORT CURBS MAY HELP AS WESTERN ECONOMIES STAGNATE\nJosef Poeschl, Czech specialist at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies (WIIW) said that the immediate problem was the poor economic performance of West European economies.\n\"It is an economic law that if a stagnating economy is trading with a growing one, the latter will be faced with a deterioration of the trade balance,\" he said.\nPoeschl suggested imposing temporary import surcharges and higher taxation on some commodities which are mostly imported.\n\"But if the Czech deficit does not shrink, a devaluation (of the Czech crown) will remain the only way out.\"\nWORRIES ARE EXAGGERATED, EXPORTS WILL GROW NEXT YEAR\nSome economists said the government should not panic.\n\"The increase of the trade deficit will stop in 1997 at 150 to 160 billion crowns,\" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Prague's Komercni Banka.\nIn 1997, the first effects of an investment wave will be felt, boosted by reviving demand on EU markets, especially the acceleration of economic growth in Germany, he said.\nThe Czechs will also benefit from a partial re-orientation of exporters toward neighbouring post-communist countries and the former Soviet Union.\nJanacek said there will be a market-based weakening of the crown, from currently above parity with the central bank mark/dollar basket to below parity in the first half of 1997.\n\"This will help to accelerate exports, and to slow down imports,\" he said.\nDEVALUATION WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD\n\"We think the country's trade deficit will likely stabilise in 1997...so, as you can guess, we have plenty to say about what the government shouldn't do,\" said Boris Gomez, analyst at ING Barings in Prague.\nHe pointed to a positive, yet gradual shift of exports from commodities to sophisticated finished goods, and development of eastern export markets with higher economic growth potential.\nA crown devaluation \"is not a painless cure and would do more damage than good to the small and open Czech economy that is heavily dependent on imports at this stage\".\nIt would \"generate a wage-price spiral\" and hurt credibility, Gomez said. Import surcharges would also sap the economy of needed modernisation.", "Regulations issued by Indonesia earlier this year promoting the creation of mutual funds have become a landmark for the local industry, delegates to a conference said on Wednesday.\n\"The recognition of open-end funds or mutual funds by the Capital Market Law has been quite instrumental in the development of the Indonesian investment fund industry over the past few months,\" said Melli Darsa of the law firm Hadiputranto, Hadinoto and Partners in Jakarta.\nDarsa was one of several fund experts attending a mutual fund conference in Jakarta who predicted a bright future for the domestic industry, with seven open-end mutual funds already established and five more in the pipeline.\nIndonesia released regulations in May outlining accounting methods, reporting procedures and valuation methods for open-end mutual funds, which were allowed for the first time by the country's 1995 Capital Market Law.\nThe new legal framework gives Indonesia an edge, placing it half-way between the high risk and reward markets in China and India and the most exciting developed countries, most of which have hostile tax regimes, said Anthony Travers of the Hong Kong law firm Maples and Calder.\n\"In many respects, Indonesia is a halfway house,\" Travers told the conference. \"Indonesia has a much more developed (financial) infrastructure than China and India.\"\nBut delegates saw significant obstacles ahead, including an almost complete ignorance of mutual funds among Indonesians, high-yielding bank deposits that lure domestic savings away from Jakarta's illiquid stock market, and restrictions on foreign investment.\nAlthough Indonesian pension funds hold nearly US$2.4 billion they are prohibited from investing overseas, prompting some foreign fund managers to question the benefits of establishing Indonesian subsidiaries that will be restricted to managing domestic funds onshore.\nBut government officials made it clear that the purpose of the new rules was to persuade Indonesians to invest at home to spur development of domestic capital markets.\n\"We want to enhance domestic self-sufficiency. That is why you can only invest in Indonesian securities or new offerings,\" said Iwan Pontjowinoto, president director of P.T. Danareksa Fund Management, a state-controlled finance company that launched the first of the new open funds.\n\"We want to have local funds that can help the government by investing in the stock market,\" he said.\nThe new funds can only invest in domestic securities and are prohibited from selling more than one percent of their shares or units to any one investor, ensuring a wide investor base.\nThe new rules also ensure the funds are broadly invested, prohibiting them from spending more than 10 percent of their net asset value on any one company or buying securities representing more than five percent of the issuer's paid-up capital.\nThe conference, which attracted about 40 delegates from fund management companies, law firms, rating agencies and fund custodians around Asia, ended on Wednesday with a workshop on how to structure and price mutual funds.", "Misys, Britain's fast-growing, 950 million pound ($1.5 billion) software supplier, posted record half-year results on Wednesday and said it was eyeing up to five international acquisition targets worth up to $30 million each.\nChairman Kevin Lomax told Reuters that Misys, which has snapped up software trading firms in South East Asia, Ireland, the U.S. and Europe, was keen on businesses that operated within a strong international financial services market.\n\"They (possible acquisition targets) are worth mainly between $2.0 million and $30 million...,\" Lomax said.\nMisys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to 12,000 banks with 4,000 separate installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.\nAnd with 18.7 million pounds of cash and undisclosed, but low debt levels, Lomax said the company had plently of headroom in its cash flow and borrowing facilities to enable it to embark again on the acquisition trail.\nOnly last month, Misys announced the planned $60 million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software.\nSupplying software to banks and insurers has brought rich rewards to Misys. The group raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- 10 percent higher than in the last half year.\nLomax said he saw the possibility of \"creating quite a bit of shareholder value\" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.\nThe group has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.\nIn the last 12 months, Misys's shares have more than doubled to 1140 pence from 567 pence as the group systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.\nLomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' price/earnings ratios are comparable, he says.\nBut the stock has slipped recently, and was trading 2.5 pence weaker at 1115p by 1115 GMT -- despite the strong results.\nIn terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its competitors. Large rivals such as Reuters Holdings Plc and America's SunGard Data Systems impinge only on parts of its market, Lomax noted.\n\"Nobody of any serious calibre or size competes across the board with us.\"\nThe group lifted its half year dividend 15 percent to 4.57p.", "Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.\n\"A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China,\" a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.\n\"There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of,\" he said.\nAnother industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.\nChinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.\nMetal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.\nAnother trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.\n\"People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again,\" he said. \"And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there.\"\nOn top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.\nLatest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.\nPrices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.\nLME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.\nA year ago, the price was $1,742.\n\"Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250,\" another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: \"There is good support at the $1,300 level.\"\nLME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.\n\"This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it,\" he said.\nChinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.\n\"Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit,\" the European trader said.\nTraders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.\nLatest Hong Kong indications of premium or discount in US$/tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis:\n\t\t\t\t\tOct 14\t  Oct 7\n   COPPER\t\t\t 60-65\t   60-65\n   ALUMINIUM  Western\t 30-70\t   70\n\t\t   CIS\t\t N/A\t   60\n   LEAD (Chinese brands)\tN/A\t   N/A\n\t   (LME registered)\tN/A\t   75\n   ZINC\t\t\t     N/A\t   70\n($1=8.3 yuan)", "A top Chinese defence official has stepped down in a reshuffle linked to China's string of satellite failures, political sources said on Friday.\nGeneral Ding Henggao has been replaced as Minister of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (COSTIND), a key body charged with overseeing high technology projects related to defence.\nDing, 65, was succeeded at the helm of the ministerial level COSTIND by 61-year-old Cao Gangchuan, a lieutenant-general and deputy chief of general staff of the People's Liberation Army.\n\"I can confirm that (Ding) stepped down and the change was made in late November or early December,\" said an official of the Defence Ministry.\n\"I do not know the reason,\" he said.\nSources with close ties to the defence industry told Reuters that Ding had been at the centre of controversy, largely over satellite issues.\n\"This is partly a matter of age and partly a dispute over satellites,\" said a source.\nChina successfully launched a satellite in October but that followed a series of failures, the most recent of them last August when a Long March 3 rocket put a U.S.-built satellite into the wrong orbit.\nLast February, a Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after liftoff, killing at least six people and injuring 57 on the ground.\nIn January 1995, a Long March 2E blew up, killing a family of six on the ground and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.\n\"There have been bitter disputes over where the responsibility for the failures lies,\" said a source.\nCOSTIND is responsible for launches while China Aerospace Corporation is in charge of rockets and satellites.\nThe Soviet-trained Ding, who has a background in missiles and precision engineering, coordinated research and production of strategic missiles as well as satellite launches, according to an official biography.\nDing's departure probably coincided with a reshuffle that replaced the nation's air force and naval commanders, both of whom were also 65 years old.\nDing is the son-in-law of the late Marshal Nie Rongzhen, one of the veteran military leaders of China's communist revolution.\nNie Li, Ding's wife and daughter of Marshal Nie, stepped down from a senior post at COSTIND two years ago.", "British Petroleum Co Plc considers its Piedemonte prospect in eastern Colombia \"fundamental\" to its worldwide operations despite drilling problems and wrangles over the exploitation contract, a top company official said Thursday.\nJohn Doust, executive director of BP's local subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (Colombia) Ltd, predicted the field, still at the test stage, could come on stream by the end of 1999.\nHe estimated the total cost of developing the field, estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude and condensates, could run to about $2.2 billion, some of which would be shared by state oil company Ecopetrol.\n\"The oil project currently under way in the Piedemonte is fundamental for the worldwide organisation of the BP group,\" Doust said in a speech to journalists.\nHis recognition of the strategic importance of the 287,000 hectare block, in which BP has pinpointed three promising hydrocarbon formations after exploring just 15 percent of the total area, once again raises the question how BP will push the Colombian government for sweeter contract terms.\nBP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, argues that given tough drilling conditions, the terms of its so-called sliding scale association contract with Ecopetrol makes it unprofitable to exploit the field.\nUnder the existing contract, Ecopetrol's share of the profits rise as production increases from 50 percent to a maximum 76 percent.\nBP has been pushing for a so-called R Factor contract -- which the Colombian government has so far denied -- which would take account of investment and operating costs to ensure adequate profit margins.\n\"We understand the uncertainty of the (Piedemonte) issue and the nature of the debate have caused uneasiness amongst many people.... Let us keep in mind that we are truly seeking to achieve a break-even point and a platform of confidence for BP so that we can operate in an internationally competitive economic position,\" Doust said.\nLast month, Colombia's Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar proposed BP should hand back rights to the 85 percent of the block that is virtually unexplored with the guarantee that Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under R Factor conditions at a later date and contract out the remainder to other companies.\nDoust said BP was \"seriously considering\" the proposal. It is understood, however, that BP would be loath to surrender the rights to almost 50 percent of a block with huge potential under the current offer on the table.\nBP has recently been hit by allegations of indirect links to right-wing paramilitary death squads that have assassinated social leaders close to its operations in eastern Colombia.\nDoust blamed the accusations on a campaign to discredit the company and repeated earlier statements that he had invited the country's chief prosecutor to carry out an in-depth investigation into the claims.", "The drive to cut costs and offset falling margins in insurance broking continued apace on Thursday as Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings Plc and Fenchurch Plc confirmed that they are to merge.\nThe two London-based brokers announced last week they were in talks and said the complementary nature of their businesses would offer significant benefits to clients, employees and shareholders.\nThe merger comes against a background of industry over-capacity and intense competition which has put increasing pressure on margins and led to an acceleration in consolidation as companies search for economies of scale.\nThe companies said they believed the deal would create a stronger, more broadly based and competitive group better positioned to win new business and revenues.\nAnother attraction of the deal is the scope it offers for cutting costs through the merger of head offices, the companies' branch networks and the rationalisation of support and administrative functions.\nSuch moves will produce cost saving of at least five million pounds in the 12 months to March 1998 and together with the improved prospects for revenue growth will significantly enhance earnings and dividend propects, the company said.\nFenchurch shareholders are to be offered 628 shares in the new company, to be called Lambert Fenchurch Group, for every 1,000 shares they hold, valuing Fenchurch at around 27.6 million pounds ($46.18 million).\nLast year's results for the two groups highlight the difficulties faced in the industry with Lowndes' reporting a nine percent fall in pre-tax profits to 13.9 million pounds.\nFenchurch's profits dropped 27 percent to 5.9 million pounds, prompting it to more than halve its final dividend.\nThe deal comes just weeks after Lloyd Thompson Group Plc and JIB Group Plc announced they are to merge in a deal worth just under 300 million pounds.\nThe companies believe today's move will reinforce operations in areas where both are strong such as the the UK retail, marine cargo, international non-marine and reinsurance markets.\nLowndes position in marine, fine art and entertainment will also be complimented by Fenchurch's position in North American non-marine and aviation and the broad spread of operations would offer improved growth potential, they said.\nFuture growth is to be pursued through a combination of organic growth and acquisition.\nLowndes chief executive David Margrett is to become chief executive of the new group with Lowndes chairman Sir Robert Clark becomning non-executive chairman.\nThe costs of the merger are expected to amount to around 11 million pounds.", "Apple Computer Inc., struggling to remain the teacher's pet among computer makers, is turning a modified version of its handheld Newton organizer into an inexpensive portable computer for students.\nThe computer maker on Monday will unveil the Apple eMate 300, an $800 machine that looks like a grown-up's laptop with a keyboard and a flip-up screen, but in a rugged casing that can survive rough handling.\nApple plans to sell the machine directly to elementary and high schools, beginning early next year, as an alternative to personal computers. For the price of a $2,500 multimedia PC, a school can buy three eMates, Apple executives said.\n\"The federal government says we need to get to a three-to-one student-to-computer ratio by the year 2000,\" said Jim Groff, general manager of Apple's information appliances group. \"I would say the eMate is the only credibled vehicle for accomplishing that.\"\nMore vital to Apple, the product could keep educators from abandoning the company as the leading supplier of computers for classrooms, analysts said.\n\"The potential for something like this in a classroom setting is tremendous,\" said Mike McGuire, a mobile computing analyst at Dataquest Inc. \"This will be an indication to educators that Apple is one of the few companies spending time extending computing to more and more kids.\"\nApple needs a distinctive product to set itself apart from other personal computer makers crowding into the education market, analysts said.\nAlthough Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., still enjoys strong educational sales, sales of IBM-compatible personal computers by companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. are growing much faster.\nApple's computer has always been the favored tool for teaching children how to use computers. But in the face of Apple's uncertain future and a flood of cheap PCs, schools are less likely to remain loyal.\nFor the 1996-1997 school year, of all the computers that schools plan to buy, 56 percent will be Apple Macintoshs and 40 percent IBM-compatible machines, according to a recent report by Quality Education Data, an education market researcher. In the previous school year, the purchasing plans were 61 percent Macintosh and 38 percent PC.\n\"The numbers are overwhelming in favor of PCs,\" said Carole Cotton, president of CCA Consulting Inc., another tracker of technology purchases by schools.\n\"No school district can afford to make a mistake\" when picking computers they will use for years, she noted.\nApple's Groff said, however, that the eMate is not the company's answer to competitors' inroads.\nInstead, he said, the device was built for schools asking for a cheap, powerful computer that can offer educational software and Internet connections -- as well as endure rough handling by kids.\n\"When we introduced the Newton three years ago, it was a solution in search of an application,\" Groff said. Education turned out to be one of the best applications, he said.\nAlong with the eMate, Apple plans to unveil a beefier version of the Newton MessagePad on Monday. The new MessagePad 2000 features better Internet capabilities, easier connection to PCs and built-in word processing and spreadsheet software.\nAnalysts said, however, that the eMate is the more interesting device. Teachers and students will like it because it is not as esoteric and hard to run as a traditional personal computer.\n\"Kids are having to learn more about how to run a computer than about reading and writing,\" McGuire said. \"The ability to have the kid just turn on the device and get right into the writing assigment is really valuable.\"\nThe eMate weighs four pounds (1.8 kg) and fits into a backpack.

We were pleasantly surprised.\"\nHe added that the company is prepared to increase production if demand is stronger than expected, as it did in 1996.\nAfter focusing the last several years on improving operations, Oberhelman said the company now thinks it's time to increase spending on research and development and on capital assets to improve shareholder value in the future.  \nTotal capital expenditures were $642 million in 1996 and are expected to rise 10 to 15 percent in 1997, while research and development is expected to rise 20 percent from the $410 million spent in 1996, Caterpillar said.\n\"It's going to be a little bit of everything,\" he said when asked if the expenditures would be focused on acquisition or internal development.\nHe said the company is likely to

Jiangyi, deputy director of the Yichang Resettlement Bureau.\nEvacuation of the giant reservoir area -- to cover more than 600 square km (230 square miles) -- began in 1994 and will involve moving about 100,000 people from Yichang county alone, Wang Jiangyi said.\nLEAVING ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS\nThe fates of hundreds of thousands of households in Hubei and neighbouring Sichuan province were sealed in 1992 when Beijing ended seven decades of debate to give the green light to start work on the gargantuan dam that is to harness the power of the world's third longest river.\nBeijing hopes the project, to be completed in the year 2009, will help to power China's economic charge in the 21st century and bring an end to disastrous flooding that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 people in this century alone.\nOfficials say they have run into opposition from many local residents unwilling to abandon their ancestral homes and traditional lifestyles.\n\"There are residents who aren't willing to move,\" said Wang Kaidong, village chief of Xujiachong, which is just two km (1.2 miles) from the dam site.\n\"It is understandable that they don't want to leave the homes their families

policies and compensation standards.\"\nOf the project's estimated 204 billion yuan ($24.6 billion) cost, about 40 billion yuan has been earmarked to finance the resettlement, said He Gong, a deputy general manager of the Three Gorges Development Co.\nGovernment work teams have fanned out through the countryside offering compensation to residents based on the size and quality of their houses and farms that will be committed to the watery mass grave.\nTotal compensation for each family ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan and those being resettled to rural areas are to receive parcels of land to build new houses on, Wang Jiangyi of the resettlement bureau said.\nBlocks of apartment buildings have sprung up to house those moving into urban areas to be employed in factories or tertiary industries, Wang Jiangyi said.\nRelocated families will also enjoy preferential charges for electricity, water and road use and will be allowed to make two moving trips free of charge, Wang Jiangyi said.\nIf ethical campaigns and cash rewards failed to convince the stubborn to pack up, authorities could still resort to the force of law, Wang said.\n\"In the resettlement process, if there is any

The companies were invited to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent of the rich find.\nAs the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry.

While a fixed exchange rate might reassure foreign investors about currency stability, it can also prompt a slew of unruly side effects.\n\"What you ultimately sacrifice is your control over inflation,\" said Alan Butler-Henderson, regional strategist with ING Barings in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and China all peg their currencies directly or indirectly to the U.S. dollar, requiring all them to mimic U.S. monetary policy to a greater or lesser extent regardless of domestic conditions.\nMost of these economies bear no relation at all to the slow-growth, low-inflation United States. Instead, they are experiencing high growth and a rapid increase in domestic consumption at the same time -- an ideal recipe for inflation.\nThe lack of traditional inflation-fighting tools is a serious loss for countries anxious to avoid any erosion of often hard-earned economic progress.\nSERIOUS PENALTIES\nThere are other, serious penalties, too.\nA lucrative interest rate arbitrage can cause real problems for small Asian countries with fixed exchange rates. Best described as borrow low, lend high, the most common arbitrage tends to attract precisely the sort of capital inflows most small, Asian countries dread: so-called \"hot money.\"\nLarge financial institutions with access to the best international lending rates deposit borrowed funds into Asian banks offering much higher yields and, because of the fixed exchange rate, avoid currency loss when they switch out.\nHigher rates offer bigger returns, which attract even larger flows of hot money that swell money supply dramatically. Attempts by central banks to curb money supply by raising rates can have the reverse effect, luring in more hot, volatile money.\nBoth Thailand and Indonesia are familiar with this danger.\nOne economist noted that Indonesia has offered one of the best arbitrage opportunities in Asia for as long as it has depreciated its currency by between three and five percent annually, but the returns were particularly spectacular last year.\nSpeculators and hedge funds borrowed large sums in Japanese yen at about 0.75 percent annually and switched them into Indonesian bank accounts yielding 15 percent -- or more when riots swept through Jakarta in the summer.\n\"In terms of cost of funds, when you take the currency depreciation of the yen and the mild depreciation of the rupiah into account, you're paying nothing,\" the economist said.\nThe problem became so acute last year that Indonesia's central bank was forced to widen repeatedly the trading band for the rupiah, taking the market by surprise.\n\"The point of widening the fluctuation is to impart greater uncertainty so that it's not a freebie,\" said Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.\nIndonesia also ordered its commercial banks to stop lending on occasion, even though soaring rates and strong loan demand offered excellent returns.\nTHE THAI EXPERIENCE\nThailand, which pegs its beleaguered baht to a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar, tried to turn this arbitrage to its advantage by setting up the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF) in 1993.\nThe plan, much admired by Asian experts, back-fired when Moody's Investors Service downgraded Thailand's short-term debt rating, drawing attention to its foreign liabilities.\nThe negative attention helped to fuel rampant speculation about a devaluation of the baht, forcing massive intervention by Thailand's central bank to keep the unit above a 6-1/2-year low.\nUnder the BIBF, a number of foreign and domestic banks were allowed to borrow foreign currency overseas, usually in U.S. dollars, and then lend the money in Thailand.\nThe scheme was a huge success. Foreign investors, already benefiting from competitive rates, also qualified for preferential tax treatment and rushed to invest in Thailand.\n\"Without those tax incentives and the access to cheap loans - U.S. dollars are by definition cheaper than Thailand (baht) - those companies would not be attracted to Thailand,\" said Clive McDonnell, chief economist at Crosby Group.\nBIBF flows were used primarily for long-term investment, but international accounting rules required that they be classifed as short-term. This generated a sudden explosion in Thailand's short-term external debt to 63.3 percent of private sector debt in 1995 compared with 20.5 percent in 1993 -- a situation that quickly came to Moody's attention.\nAsian economists defended the scheme while acknowledging its risks. Salomon Brothers noted that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves of US$38 billion far exceed outstanding short-term loans of US$16.1 billion.\nAnd Moody's rival, Standard and Poor's, pointed out that many BIBF loans are backed by foreign banks rather than domestic financial institutions.\n\"Foreign BIBFs are probably less vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence, because their parent banks are more likely to stand behind them should unaffiliated lenders withdraw their credit lines,\" Standard & Poor's said. \"Moreover, obligations of foreign-owned BIBFs are not a contingent liability of the Thai government, given their foreign ownership.\"\nThere is no question that the BIBF helped to lift foreign liabilities in Thailand's banking sector, but the underlying causes of the banks' asset quality problems were more commonly blamed on a weak property sector, economic recession, political turmoil and a gaping current account deficit.\nRecent attacks on the baht were precipitated by concern about how to finance the current account following projections of a fourth-quarter fiscal deficit.\nBut analysts said the foreign liability created by the BIBF will probably provide further motivation for the central bank to defend the currency. And a sustained defence will require action on those asset quality problems.\n\"This means shutting down insolvent institutions and building the capital base of viable ones. The longer the delay in formulating such a plan, the greater will be the baht's susceptibility to speculative attacks,\" Goldman Sachs said.", "General Motors Corp cut a deal to end a costly strike at an Indianapolis metal stamping plant on Saturday, about 14 hours after it announced a tentative national contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.\nThe five-day Indianapolis strike had threatened to paralyze most of GM's North American light truck production by early next week. Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers.\nBut the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division.\nHowever, GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant.\nRonald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers.\nThe national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels.\n\"We've got great negotiators at the top,\" Gettelfinger said. \"This was local issues.\"\nHe declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals.\n\"We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,\" Yokich said. \"I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.\"\nPresident Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. \"I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,\" he said.\nAbout 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.\nAnalysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23.\nThe UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.\nDetails of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp\nBoth of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.\nOne union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold.\nIn a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.\n\"I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,\" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. \"Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.\"", "Russia's Norilsk Nickel metals group, a key supplier to world markets, said on Tuesday it was struggling with a shaky financial future despite keeping output steady at its top plant.\n\"We are undoubtedly in a state of financial crisis,\" said Viktor Feldman, deputy economics director at the Norilsk group.\nFeldman singled out the high cost of maintaining social services in the inhospitable Far North of Russia where many of its leading plants are based. \"Our biggest woe is supporting the social sphere, a sphere which, I might add, the government should be supporting,\" he said.\nA senior official at the Norilsk combine, the flagship plant of the RAO Norilsk Nickel group, said the facility's output had gone according to plan, with 1996 nickel production at 100,000 tonnes and forecast flat in 1997.\nNorilsk is the world's second largest producer of refined nickel, a principal component in stainless steel, and also accounts for about 45 percent of world platinum and palladium production, according to metals analysts.\nBut First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin was quoted by Interfax news agency on Tuesday as saying the plant might have to issue stock to pay off what the agency said was its 1.7 trillion rouble ($300 million) in debts or face bankruptcy.\nPotanin is the former head of Uneximbank, the big Russian commercial bank that controls a 38 percent state-owned stake in Norilsk from a 1995 government shares-for-loans auction.\n\"We are constantly improving Norilsk's financial situation,\" said Alexei Parshikov, director of Interrosimpex, the powerful Russian group that now handles nearly all of Norilsk's exports and is trying to streamline trading operations to boost profits.\n\"I wouldn't use the word crisis to describe us, because crisis is when production stops, and that is not happening. We are producing according to plan.\"\nNorilsk officials have for the first time in years declined to provide immediate total group production results for 1996 and 1997 forecasts.\nUneximbank press relations director Yuri Oleinikov said the group had slightly overfulfilled its plan to boost nickel output by three percent and copper output by six percent in 1996, but gave no absolute figures.\nThe group's 1995 nickel output was 180,100 tonnes, while its refined copper output was 338,700 tonnes.\nAbout one third of Norilsk's profits go to supporting social services in the expensive and vastly remote Far North, where four of the group's six key enterprises, including the flagship combine, are based.\n\"We want 1997 to be the year we stabilise, and we are doing a lot to make sure that this happens,\" Feldman said. \"But my position does not permit me to say this actually will happen.\"\nPotanin said Norilsk, if it did not agree to a share issue to raise capital, would be put in the hands of a special tax commission which could institute liquidation proceedings.\nOleinikov said he did not think a share issue would solve Norilsk's cash problems and called on the government to understand the logistics of producing metal in a frozen, inhospitable section of the globe.\n\"Our sector should have a strong state role because it is a core industry -- it supports people and, through its exports, the federal budget,\" Feldman said. \"Production will undoubtedly continue normally -- we take a lot of measures to ensure that.\nNorilsk ordinary shares had fallen 8.95 percent to $6.00 at 4.26 p.m.(1226 GMT) on the Russian Trading System.\n\"The state should understand that to demand too much is to cut into production,\" Oleinikov said. \"They will not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.\"", "Several large-capitalization Canadian stocks could benefit, while others may be hurt when the Toronto Stock Exchange changes rules governing control blocks in its key 300 Composite Index on Friday.\nStocks such as Barrick Gold Corp, funeral home operator Loewen Group Inc and energy firm Petro-Canada should get snapped up by fund managers when the rules change, analysts said.\n\"Index funds, which try to match the weighting of the index, are going to have to scramble to buy X percent more Barrick shares...by Friday,\" said an analyst who declined to be identified.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange, which handles more than 80 percent of Canada's equity trading, will increase the relative weighting of 30 stocks on Friday by raising the level of control blocks to 20 percent from 15 percent.\nThe change will take effect at the start of trading on Friday.\nRelative weighting describes the impact a stock or sub-group has on the overall TSE 300 Composite Index.\nA control block is a group of shares owned by a single entity. Control blocks are not considered part of a stock's weighting because these shares cannot freely trade in the market.\nUnder the new rules, the federal government's 18.26 percent holding in Petro-Canada Inc will be included in the company's overall float. Petro-Canada's will therefore see its weighting rise to 1.22 percent from about 1.03 percent.\nThe TSE is changing the definition of a control block to comply with Ontario Securities Commission reporting rules, said Tara O'Donnell, director of derivative markets management.\nThe Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, one of Canada's biggest pension fund managers, will need to make some changes, said Zev Frishman, manager of quantitative products.\nTeachers' has almost C$45 billion in assets with a third of its money in Canadian equities.\n\"I cannot go into specific numbers or anything like that, but in essence we will have to, to some extent, adjust positions,\" Frishman said.\nBarrick will likely be one of the stocks snapped up, analysts said.\nBarrick, which is 15.7 percent owned by Trizec Hahn Corp, will now be weighted based on 100 percent of its shares from 84.3 percent. As a result, the world's third largest gold producer will see its relative weighting in the TSE 300 increase to 3.28 percent from 2.84 percent.\nLoewen's weighting will jump to about 1.74 percent from about 0.64 percent, after a control block held by chief executive Raymond Loewen and his wife is included.\nOntario Municipal Employees Retirement Services (OMERS) said it expected the control block changes to have little impact on its funds.\n\"You have to remember that the actual changes relative to the market overall are quite small,\" said Tom Gunn, senior vice-president of OMERS' investment division.\nThe list of 30 affected stocks also includes gold producer Franco-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd, Quebecor Printing Inc, publisher Hollinger Inc, energy firm Gulf Canada Resources Ltd and Shaw Industries Ltd.\nOthers are Astral Communications Inc, BC Sugar Refinery Ltd, CCL Industries Inc and Co-Steel Inc, Corel Corp, Cognos Inc, Cinram Ltd., Edper Group Ltd and First Marathon Inc and Tee-Comm Electronics Inc.", "British utilities could find share buybacks and takeovers more costly as the government ruled out tax credits on buybacks and some special dividends on Tuesday, analysts said, but they are unlikely to stop such moves.\n\"It should not stop companies doing buybacks or special dividends,\" said Michael Cohen, utilities analyst at Salomon Brothers, \"those should still go ahead if justified.\"\nChancellor Kenneth Clarke said shareholders would no longer be able to claim tax credits on share buybacks or special dividends associated with share consolidations or takeovers.  \nThe move is a means of giving the UK Treasury more room for a cut in income tax in its November budget, analysts said.\nShares in the utility sector, which has seen a steady flow of buybacks and special dividends both within and outside the context of takeovers, initially slumped on the news but later showed some recovery.\n\"It was a knee-jerk reaction, slightly overdone,\" said Kevin Lapwood, utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch.  \nShares in Anglian Water slid 31-1/2 to a low of 525 pence before edging back to 544-1/2 pence at 1300 GMT while Yorkshire Water was down 17-1/2 pence at 622-1/2 pence after slumping to a low of 613 pence.\nIn the electricity sector, London Electric stumbled to a low of 598 pence before recovering to be down 20-1/2 pence at 608-1/2 pence while generator PowerGen was off 10-1/2 pence at 479 pence from a low of 460 pence earlier.\n\"The market was of the view that release of value from the balance sheets was less likely, but I think that was overdone,\" Lapwood said.  \nWater and electricity companies report half-year results in a flood between November and December and several had been tipped as likely to offer a buyback or special dividend.\nAnalysts said the upshot of the government's decision would be to make buybacks more expensive, but the impetus for such moves will not change.\n\"The logic of a buyback has not changed, it will just be at a premium. And the move on special dividends could make takeovers more expensive, but if it is a good acquisition, it will go ahead,\" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.  \nCompanies are generally reticent about specific plans and several contacted declined to comment on the new tax rules or share strategies.\nAnalysts suggested that of the water companies, Yorkshire Water might consider a buyback while Anglian and Thames might consider restructuring the balance sheet.\nEast Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity and London Electric were singled out as potentially considering special dividends, while the market is still waiting to see such a move from PowerGen, analysts said.\n\"It does not really affect the companies, just a group of investors,\" Cohen said.\nThose funds affected by the move are likely to change investments to try to avoid any impact, analysts said.\n\"At the end of the day it will probably end up roughly equal,\" the analyst said.\n\"Gross funds will restructure and companies will come out with cleverer mechanisms,\" he added.", "Ford Motor Co. on Friday became the second of the U.S. Big Three automakers to align itself with the emerging auto superstore trend by announcing a new agreement with Republic Industries Inc., the parent company of AutoNation USA.\nUnder the agreement, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.\nThe move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.\nFord spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.\nMullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.\nLast month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.\nFord's deal with Republic is a \"framework agreement\" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the \"backbone\" of its franchise system.\n\"However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods,\" he said. \"We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system.\"\nThat is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.\nA year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..\nThe move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.\nThe new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.\nThe Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. \"That's big news,\" said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. \"It's definitely a change for Ford.\"\nThe move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.\nGeneral Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.\n\"We've held discussions. We'll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we'll review it,\" he said.", "A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:\nJournalist: \"Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name.\"\nSecretary (with no hesitation): \"Doctor.\"\nCzechs are obsessed with academic titles.\nIt was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained \"Doctor of Law\" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.\n\"In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,\" Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.\nNormal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as \"Mr. Engineer\" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or \"Mr. Doctor\", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.\nKalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.\nHis resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised \"JUDr\" moniker in campaign material and biographies.\nApart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.\n\"I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,\" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of \"Dr.\" for this story.\nThe Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.\nSome of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless \"Velvet Revolution\" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.\nCommunist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.\nKalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.\nThe daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.\nThe daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.\nHavel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.\n\"He made himself a name, not a title,\" Lidove Noviny wrote.", "China said on Wednesday it would empower Hong Kong's courts to put on trial off-duty Chinese soldiers after Beijing resumes control over the British colony in 1997.\nThe standing committee of the National People's Congress (parliament), which is in session in Beijing, was expected to pass a law spelling out how to handle criminal or civil cases involving troops to be garrisoned in Hong Kong, the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\"Crimes committed by off-duty personnel.... will be handled by the courts of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Adminstrative Region),\" the agency said.\nCriminal cases involving on-duty soldiers would be handled by military courts, it said.\nCivil rights offences committed by off-duty members of the Chinese garrison, which will be responsible for Hong Kong's security after the colony returns to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, would be dealt with by Hong Kong courts, it said.\nCivil rights offences committed by soldiers while on duty would be referred to China's Supreme People's Court, the nation's highest judicial body, it said.\nChinese lawmakers had used British army practices in Hong Kong as a reference in drafting the measures, Xinhua quoted Fu Quanyou, general chief of staff of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), as saying.\nDefence operations of the PLA would not be subject to Hong Kong courts, Xinhua said but did not elaborate.\n\"Troops stationed in Hong Kong will notify the Hong Kong SAR government in advance of any military drills and exercises to be conducted that involve the public interest,\" it said.\nThe Hong Kong government said in a statement it was \"not able to provide a detailed response to the garrison law just relying on the reports\".\n\"We hope that we and the people of Hong Kong can have an early opportunity to study the draft law itself,\" it added.\nXinhua said Hong Kong would be required to provide facilities for the carrying out of defence duties and would have to consult the military when drafting policies that concern them.\nMilitary personnel would be forbidden from participating in political or religious organisations in the territory, it said.\nBeijing has eagerly sought to allay fears among Hong Kong's 6.3 million people over the posting of Chinese troops in the territory. State media has said soldiers destined for Hong Kong have been studying local songs and customs.\nMany Hong Kong people view with trepidation the arrival of Chinese troops, remembering the PLA's bloody 1989 crackdown on student-led demonstrations for more democracy in Beijing.\n\"Sending the People's Liberation Army troops to Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, has become a matter of concern among Hong Kong residents,\" Xinhua said.\n\"Troops stationed in Hong Kong will not interfere in the SAR's local affairs,\" it pledged.\nChina has not revealed how large a force it will post in Hong Kong but says it will send no more than the 10,000 troops Britian stationed there at its peak level.", "Florida is set to challenge the tobacco industry on Friday using a tough anti-racketeering law that could mean bigger damages against cigarette makers if the state prevails.\nThe new claim under the state's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, tacked onto Florida's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion for treating smokers' illnesses, could mean more losses for the tobacco makers, tobacco-litigation expert Christopher Mueller of the University of Colorado School of Law said.\n\"Florida has a good law (for winning damage claims) but it only goes back to 1994. Using RICO may give the state a deeper reach,\" Mueller said.\nThe state's RICO law, similar to a federal statute and laws on the books in other states, would allow Florida officials to seek damages from before 1994, when a state law was passed that opened the way for Florida to try to recoup money spent on treating poor smokers.\nFlorida is one of 16 states and several big cities, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that have sued tobacco companies to recoup costs of health care for poor smokers.\nTexas and now Florida are among a handful of states that are also using RICO laws to bolster their claims against Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker, and other tobacco companies. Florida filed the added claims under RICO laws on Nov 4.\nMueller said use of RICO could add to the industry's potential financial losses by allowing Florida to make claims to recoup costs of treating smokers from before 1994.\nFlorida Attorney General Bob Butterworth is set to appear on Friday in county court in West Palm Beach, a spokesman said. He and attorneys for tobacco companies will argue over the industry's request that the RICO claim be dismissed.\nIt was unclear when a ruling would be made, a court official said.\nPresiding Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen recently dismissed 15 counts of the state's 18-count lawsuit that claims the industry was liable for state-paid hospital costs from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases. The full case is expected to come to trial next year.\nA Jacksonville, Fla., jury last summer handed the tobacco industry its biggest loss in a court case yet when it awarded $750,000 to a lung cancer sufferer who had smoked for half a century. The defendant was the Brown & Williamson unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc.\nIn Washington, anti-smoking groups said divesting tobacco investments was being actively considered by a growing number of institutional investors concerned by both the ethics and the financial outlook for the industry.", "Apple Computer Inc. stunned investors Wednesday by reporting an unexpected $25 million fourth quarter profit, stemming a year of management turmoil and swelling red ink.\nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker, which had been expected to report a loss of 30 cents a share, posted a profit of 20 cents a share for the last three months of fiscal 1996, its first quarterly profit this year.\nIn the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $60 million, or 48 cents per share. Included in the most recent quarter's operating results was a gain of $17 million.\nFourth-quarter revenue for fiscal 1996 declined 23 percent to $2.32 billion from $3 billion.\nApple released the news after the market closed and its shares jumped as much as $4.25 to $30 a share in after-hours trading.\nIndustry analysts attributed the profit to Apple's aggressive cost cutting, a bigger-than-expected exodus of employees and lower prices for key components, such as memory chips.\n\"It is a shock,\" said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at JP Morgan in San Francisco who was expecting a loss. \"It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging.\"\nMost important to investors, Apple could remain profitable in coming quarters, which would bolster confidence among consumers that it will be around for years and keep loyal customers from switching to IBM-compatible personal computers, analysts said.\nFred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, stopped short of predicting a profit in the first fiscal quarter.\nHe said, however, that he expects the company's costs to increase only slightly in the December quarter on higher advertising expenses and that first-quarter revenue should be about the same as in the fourth fiscal quarter.\n\"We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests,\" Anderson said.\n\"We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments,\" he said in a statement.\nIn the previous three quarters, Apple reported huge losses because of declining Macintosh sales, management turmoil and growing popularity of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software, which compete with Macintosh.\nThe company began slashing its costs when former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio took charge of Apple in February.\nWith most of the cost-cutting plan completed, Apple now will concentrate on the much tougher task of increasing revenue, Anderson said.\nWhile shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent from the third quarter, a sign that customers were once again buying Apple's products.\nApple has a slew of new products in the works.\nOn Monday, the company is expected to unveil a new low-end PowerBook, a much-needed portable computer to replace Apple's older glitch-prone models.\nIn the first calendar quarter, the company also is expected to introduce new low-end consumer desktop models, a niche from which Apple had retreated in an effort to cut costs.\nFor the full year, Apple reported a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings. In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share.\nRevenue for the year fell 11 percent to $9.83 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago.", "Australian casino company Crown Ltd said on Tuesday its earnings were likely to suffer due to lost time at its new casino complex in Melbourne.\nCrown, which has seen its share price fall as doubts emerge over its profit outlook, confirmed that a recent heatwave forced workers at the site to down tools for a number of days.\n\"I don't think we have made a calculation yet on what effect it will have on the bottom line, but it's something you don't need in this part of the project,\" Crown spokesman Gary O'Neill said. \"I think it will (impact profit),\" he added.  \nCrown had planned to open its new A$1.6 billion casino, hotel and shopping complex in Melbourne in March. It is now aiming for late April and maybe even May, O'Neill told Reuters.\n\"We are still hoping to open towards the end of April...but things like this don't help obviously and it could have a small effect on the bottom line. It could put the open date back to May,\" he said.\nO'Neill was commenting on a newspaper report which said members of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) stopped work 10 times this month as the temperature topped 35 degrees Celcius.  \n\"There were 10 days when the temperature was over 35 degrees, but I don't think we lost all of that time,\" O'Neill said. \"I think we lost a number of working days.\"\nCrown also rejected a bearish earnings forecast made by accountants Ernst and Young.\nThe forecast was cited in an  independent report sent to Crown shareholders recently.\nIt quotes Ernst and Young as forecasting basic earnings per share of 3.76 cents in 1997/98 (July-June), compared with brokers' average forecast of 14.8 cents for the same year.  \nThe brokers' forecast was based on a mean pre-abnormal net profit of A$87.5 million for 1997/98, according to Barceps forecasting service. Crown reported net profit after abnormals of A$58.38 million in 1995/96.\n\"We obviously don't agree with it (the Ernst and Young forecast),\" O'Neill said.\n\"Right at the moment, it's a very highly speculative period of time.

H&R Block Inc, which several months ago suspended plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent stake in CompuServe to shareholders, fell 1-1/2, to 26-7/8.  \nEarlier today, H&R had reported a substantial loss for its quarter ended October 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil, and said it planned to go ahead with a cut in its quarterly dividend payment to $0.20 per share from $0.32 previously.\nIn its own report, CompuServe said it lost $0.63 per share for the second quarter ended in October, after charges for exiting the Wow! business and other accounting changes. This compared to a $0.19 a share profit in the year-ago quarter.\nDisbanding Wow! resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.9 million, or $0.06 a share, and amortization of prior marketing costs led to the charge of $28.6 million, or $0.31 a share.  \n\"CompuServe's core users have always appreciated that service most for its independent forums and bulletin boards. They don't have any other place in cyberspace to get those services,\" Krasilovsky said.\nCompuServe officials stressed that no new layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide.\nIn a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, \"If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.\"  \nNontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point.\nBesides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues.\nIn disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.\nThe company announced plans to launch early next year a new \"CompuServe for Business\" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from \"thousands\" of information providers.  \nDespite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers.\nConway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. \"It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,\" he said.\nAbout 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said.\nThat's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers.\nThe 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31.\nThe Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground.\nCompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service.\n\"They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,\" he had vowed at the time.", "Western oil firms frustrated by Moscow's foot-dragging on foreign investment laws presented a study on Tuesday designed to convince conservative officials that Russia will take the lion's share of rewards in oil deals.\nThe study, outlining the benefits from six flagship production-sharing contracts requiring $129 billion in expenditure, could be the evidence nationalist and conservative parliamentarians need to pass energy and tax laws in 1997 to get the projects off the ground.\nForeign oil firms have to date invested only a tiny fraction of that total, citing high taxes, a flawed production-sharing law and Moscow's inability to ratify a list of reserves open to output-sharing deals.\n\"No investments are going to happen until there's a firm legal base,\" said a top Western oil executive who declined to be named, speaking after a conference where the study was presented.\nThe document, prepared by the Petroleum Advisory Forum, or PAF, and a group of Russian academics, said six major international projects requiring $102 billion in Western funding over 57 years would generate $591 billion in total benefits, with Russia getting 87 percent of the total.\nThe deals would at peak create 550,000 jobs, raise real gross domestic product by $450 billion, boost state revenues by $257 billion and Russian private sector revenues by $258 billion.\nThe foreign side would reap $76 billion in benefits, including $40 billion in foreign investor profits.\n\"With the overwhelming majority of benefits accruing to Russia, these projects will make an important contribution towards Russia's future economic growth and to the stability of its emerging market economy,\" a study group statement said.\nConservative Russian officials have blocked passage of key energy laws, saying they want to prevent what they call a fire-sale of Russia's natural resources to the West and in effect hampering Western investment in Russia's oil sector.\n\"Under the current licensing regime regulating the use of subsoil resources and the current gross revenue-based tax system, large-scale investments in the Russian oil industry are not forthcoming,\" the statement said.\nDeputy Fuel and Energy Minister Valery Garipov said the study showed the necessity of Western investment in the oil industry, but he said Russian firms would have to have at least a 50 percent stake in production-sharing deals.\n\"We don't need stop-gap loans -- we need long-term investments,\" he told the same conference.\n\"Domestic investments are not appearing,\" he said, adding that only Western-financed production-sharing contracts would reverse Russia's steep oil output decline. \"There are Russian banks that bought oil companies, but where are their investments?\"\nThe study said that for each dollar directly invested in the oil sector, an additional $0.90 in revenues would be generated in related domestic industries.\nReferring to the study, PAF director Ed Verona said, \"It's a tool to show that this (foreign investment) produces benefits.\"\nAlexei Mikhailov, a parliamentarian and supporter of Western oil firms, said the six Western-sponsored projects -- Sakhalin I and II, Priobskoye, West Salym, Timan-Pechora and Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu -- could eventually account for two percent of GDP.\nMikhailov said he hoped parliamentarians would pass the revised reserves list and Western-friendly amendments to the production-sharing law in the first half of 1997.\n\"It is not enough just to provide financing and funds,\" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, the partner in Priobskoye. \"The point is, the projects must be economical for anyone (Western or Russian) to do the work.\"", "A thankful Elizabeth Forsyth, a former aide of Polly Peck head Asil Nadir, walked free from court on Thursday after three judges allowed her appeal against a five-year sentence for handling stolen money.\nForsyth, 60, who is also appealing against the money-laundering conviction itself, described her 10 months in prison as an \"experience\".\n\"I would just like to thank the court for its understanding and consideration,\" Forsyth told reporters as she was freed from the cells of London's Royal Courts of Justice.\nShe said she could not comment further on the appeal as it was still continuing.\nEarlier, the appeal judges surprised the court by making it clear at once that Forsyth would not be returning to spend another night at Holloway prison.\n\"We have formed a view that this sentence cannot stand,\" Lord Justice Beldam said at the outset of the appeal hearing, adding that the sentence was so disproportionate that, \"taking into account the time she has already served...she should not serve any longer.\"\nBeldam, hearing the appeal with two other judges, then moved on to consider Forsyth's appeal against her conviction on two counts of dishonestly handling 400,000 pounds ($650,000) of stolen funds.\nForsyth's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, later made a bail application so that Forsyth could be freed pending the outcome of the rest of the appeal.\nForsyth has been in prison since March 1996 when Justice Sir Richard Tucker surprised those following the case with the severity of his sentence.\nShe was chairman of South Audley Management, a firm set up by Turkish Cypriot Nadir to deal with his wealthy family interests before his Polly Peck empire collapsed in 1990 under a mountain of debt.\nDuring her five-week trial, the jury accepted that Forsyth had helped to launder money that had been stolen from Polly Peck by Nadir.\nNadir still faces charges connected to Polly Peck but in 1993 he fled to northern Cyprus, a territory not recognised by the British government, skipping 3.5 million pounds ($5.67 million) bail.\nOne of Forsyth's supporters told Reuters outside the court that her 90-year-old mother had been told and was said to be \"well pleased\". At the time of her sentencing, Forsyth's lawyers had argued for leniency saying she should remain outside prison to care for her mother.\nAnother of Forsyth's lawyers, Peter Krivinskas, said an application by Nadir to have the charges against him dropped would probably depend on the outcome of Forsyth's appeal against her conviction.\nThe outcome of the original trial was seen as a boost for Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) which prosecutes big fraud cases but has failed to secure convictions in several high-profile cases.", "Hong Kong, wary about upsetting its future Beijing masters when dissenters use it as an escape route, kept silent on Monday about Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe following reports he had fled to the British colony.\nHuman rights activists in Hong Kong said Wang, 46, fled here from his home in China's neighbouring Guangdong province over the weekend, just days after the communist authorities in Beijing bundled a colleague into a labour camp.\nHe was expected to leave Hong Kong soon, they said, possibly by Monday night, and probably for the United States.\nThe U.S. Consulate declined to confirm or deny that Wang had asked for asylum. \"We don't comment on asylum cases,\" consulate spokesman Patrick Corcoran said.\nWang would be the second Chinese dissident known to have fled to the United States via Hong Kong this year. Liu Gang fled last May after months of police harassment following a six-year prison stint for helping to lead the 1989 student protest movement.\n\"According to our information Wang is safe at the moment,\" Robin Munro, Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, told Reuters.\n\"I think it's likely he'll probably be going on somewhere else fairly soon,\" Munro said.\nMunro said he was unable to say where Wang was heading, but other human rights sources in Hong Kong said he was seeking refuge in the United States.\nWashington has been generous in granting asylum to Beijing's political critics since a military crackdown against the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\nScores, perhaps hundreds, of Chinese dissenters have fled to the West since then through Hong Kong, local activists say.\n\"I assume he was about to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. I can't think what else would have prompted such a rapid departure,\" Munro said, attributing Wang's move to the three-year sentence passed on dissident Liu Xiaobo last week.\nWang and Liu sparked reprisals against remaining dissidents last month when they wrote a letter demanding the impeachment of President Jiang Zemin for violating the constitution by placing the army under Communist Party, rather than state, control.\nHuman rights sources said it was unlikely Wang would speak publicly in Hong Kong but that he would explain himself when he reached his destination.\nAs Hong Kong prepares to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1, issues of human rights, and especially help for mainland dissidents, have become acutely sensitive.\n\"The Hong Kong government asks such people to keep quiet while they are here as the price for facilitating their smooth exit from the territory,\" one human rights source said. \"And the Americans go along with that quiet, too,\" he said.\nMunro saw the latest developments in China as a blow.\n\"It's extremely discouraging and quite deplorable the way the (Chinese) government has intensified its crackdown on the few remaining dissidents in China in recent weeks,\" said Munro.\nHe said the dissident movement in China had effectively been crushed, with all prominent dissidents either in jail or forced into exile.\n\"The saddest thing about it is that Wang appears to have concluded there's no way he could continue to struggle for change from within the country,\" Munro said.\nWang's activism dates from 1974 when he co-authored an attack in Guangdong on the radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nHe took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing and produced his own dissident newsletters. He was twice imprisoned and spent some 17 years in jail and labour camps.\nHe was released on parole in 1993, and before he fled he had been under constant police surveillance.", "The French government sold a nine percent stake in oil major Elf-Aquitaine on Wednesday, raising around 10 billion francs ($2 billion) and allowing the energy group to buy back a big chunk of its own shares.\nThe disposal follows a sharp rise in the Paris bourse in recent weeks and, specifically of oil stocks which have benefited from high world oil prices.\n\"Finance minister Jean Arthuis has decided to sell 24.9 million shares in Elf-Aquitaine held by the ERAP company, which will reduce the stake held by this public sector firm in Elf-Aquitaine to 0.75 percent,\" the ministry said in a statement.\nThe sale involved the placement of 12.5 million Elf shares, or 4.6 percent of the capital, at 417.50 francs per share to French and international institutions.\nElf said in a separate statement it had bought a 4.5 percent stake through its indirectly-owned financial Fingestval company as a long-term investment, accounting for the remainder of the shares sold by the state.\nElf shares slipped 2.5 francs to 423 by 1300 GMT.\nThe 10 billion francs will go into a government special account held for share sale proceeds, which is reserved for injecting into other state-owned companies, the ministry said.\nGovernment spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the money would be used to recapitalise state-owned companies which needed it, particularly those being privatised.  It will not be used to help reduce the government's budget deficit.\nFrance plans to recapitalise Thomson SA to the tune of 11 billion francs before selling the state-owned electronics group to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo Electronics Corp.\nThe Elf share sale leaves a rump 0.75 percent of Elf stock in government hands, which covers free shares due to Elf employees and non-voting petroleum certificates held by the state.\nElf was among the early privatisations in the previous conservative government of Edouard Balladur in February 1994 (Corrects timing of Elf privatisation), when it was floated at 385 francs per share to private investors.\nThe group has wide-ranging interests in oil exploration, production and refining, as well as health and beauty products through its Sanofi unit.\nIt is a major constitutuent in the Paris CAC-40 share index.\nThe group's stock purchase would boost earnings per share, chairman Philippe Jaffre said: \"This removes the uncertainty surrounding the French state's interest in the company which has weighed on the share price.\"\n\"The acquisition will automatically improve earnings per share,\" he said in a company statement.\nThe sale to institutions was handled by Paribas and SBC Warburg, after a tender with various banks. ABN Amro Rothschild acted as adviser to the government.", "Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, said Tuesday that it would take a huge C$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) charge in 1996 to strengthen its financial structure.\nThe debt-laden, Ontario government-owned utility said its board of directors also approved a C$600 million ($440 million) charge against 1997 earnings.\nThe charges, related to accounting and operational changes, come as the ruling Conservative government of Canada's most-populous province ponders the privatisation of the massive utility.\nThe heavy writedowns add up to an estimated 1996 net loss of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), Ontario Hydro said in a statement. The utility previously forecast net income of between C$600 million ($440 million) and C$625 million ($460 million).\n\"These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face,\" said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis.\nHe said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C$30 billion ($22 billion) due to overexpansion.\nOntario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers.\nIt operates 96 hydro-electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil-fuel stations.\nBut competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years.\nLast June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its 90-year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S.-based competitors.\nAmong the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C$1.2 billion ($882 million) writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations.\nThe decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility.", "H&R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now.\nThe Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry.\nIndustry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States.\nAmerica Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.\nSome analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.\n\"A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,\" said one analyst who follows the industry.\nH&R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.\nBut it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.\n\"The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter,\" H&R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.\nCompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Block will not come onto the market.\nCompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.\nIn July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.\nThe company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.\nIn response, CompuServe and H&R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.\nWhen the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.\nH&R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.\nIn addition to the losses, H&R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.\nMeanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.\n\"The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,\" one analyst said.", "China is singing the praises of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in a primetime television series but the paean to the ageing patriarch is getting mixed reviews from the man in the street.\nBeijing residents viewed the first few episodes of the 12-part documentary on the 92-year-old leader with a mixture of adulation, scepticism and indifference.\n\"I think it's great. I've seen all of the episodes so far and I'm going to watch the rest, too,\" said a 35-year-old journalist on Sunday.\n\"Deng should be honoured for China's economic development,\" he told Reuters. \"The show is just great.\"\nDeng, whose pragmatic policies helped transform China from a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, has not been seen in public in nearly two years. In his last appearance he looked frail and faltering.\nSpeculation abounds about his health, ranging from rumours he was admitted to hospital in recent days to reports he remains at home with little change in health but with fading lucidity.\nBut he has been lionised in the television series.\nAnalysts have said the documentary would help define Deng's legacy to the current party leadership and set the tone for a crucial Communist Party congress due later this year.\nSaturday's episode dealt with the period just after the 1949 Communist revolution and strove to show how Deng began forming his market-oriented economic policies.\nWhile the television series has so far avoided measuring Deng's more open policies against the disastrous radicalism of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, the contrast was not lost on some viewers.\n\"Mao liberated the country but he made mistakes like the Cultural Revolution,\" said the journalist in a reference to the decade of ultra-leftism that Mao inspired in 1966.\nSome viewers said the programme was carefully crafted by China's propaganda tsars and may not have given the whole story.\n\"Of course they have to censor a few things,\" said one 27-year-old musician who declined to be identified.\nThe series has not mentioned Deng's second wife who left him for another Communist official in 1932 when he fell from political grace for the first of three times in his long career.\nBut many people said they had not watched any of the episodes, while others who saw it were less than enthusiastic.\n\"I saw some of it but there were too many commercials,\" said a middle-aged woman who was selling peanuts and sunflower seeds at a roadside market.\nA soldier who was sweeping snow from a Beijing street, asked for his thoughts on the man responsible for China's opening up to the outside world, said; \"I don't know anything about that.

A year ago, the fledgling company earned $175,000 on sales of $23.3 million.\n\"The third quarter of 1996 was another landmark quarter for Netscape, as Netscape server and client software solutions made significant inroads into the global enterprise market,\" said Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale.\nWall Street, which had been expecting Netscape to report revenues of roughly $85 million to $90 million, had not expected the company to hit the $100 million quarterly revenue milestone until the second quarter next year, analysts said.\n\"I think the $100 million mark really shows significdant growth,\" said Hambrecht and Quist analyst Daniel Rimer, noting revenues grew 33 percent sequentially. \"This is major league revenue for a quarter.\"\nThe quarterly revenue was well above the $80.7 million it posted for the whole of 1995. For the first nine months, Netscape earned $12 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $231 million. A year earlier, the company lost $7 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $44 million.\nIn after-hours dealing, shares of Netscape were firm, changing hands as high as $44.875, up from its closing level of $44.50 in Nasdaq market trading.\nBarksdale said in an interview after the results that the indirect sales through third parties such as computer makers and systems integrators had accounted for 60 percent of overall sales, and 100 percent in Europe and Asia.\n\"We think it's a very efficient channel for us,\" he said. \"More and more we're seeing our job as demand creation through our direct sales force. We just think it's a more efficient way for these kind of products (to be sold).\"\n\"I'm very proud we have gotten to that as quickly, because we're very dependent on these people,\" he said.\nBarksdale outlined a broad range of companies which had chosen Netscape software to build applications for their computer networks, or \"intranet\" applications.\nAnalysts said the rapid growth of the market will help Netscape continue to grow in competition with rivals like Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp.\nBarksdale said he remained concerned that competitors will be confused by the competitive frenzy, although he said key Netscape products remain lower in price those of Microsoft and Lotus, for example.", "Archer Daniels Midland Co., which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its October 17 annual meeting from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.\n\"There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,\" said Edward Durkin, director of special programmes at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.\nThe carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.\nDespite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.\n\"I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,\" Lukomnik said.\nGoing forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.\nThe chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.\n\"Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,\" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.\nAs previously reported, a shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.\nThe California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favour of that measure.\nCalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.\n\"Our primary focus is the proposal,\" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS said. \"But I think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).\"\nOther proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed that shareholders' votes for directors remain confidential when there is no competing proxy.\nAt last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, \"This meeting runs according to my rules.\"\nDurkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.\nHe added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. \"There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,\" Durkin said.\nThe Justice Department said its price-fixing investigation continues.

The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 17 percent from 15.4 percent last year.\n\"These results represent the seventh consecutive year of record earnings and the seventh consecutive year return on equity was over 14 percent,\" Chairman Matthew Barrett said in a statement.\nBank of Montreal is the third bank to break through the C$1 billion threshold in recent years, following the Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.\nThe bank attributed the record earnings to higher fees, volume growth in Canada and the United States and the impact of acquiring a 16 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA de CV.\nAbout 47 percent of the Bank of Montreal's total income came from operations outside of Canada in fiscal 1996.\nNet income from its U.S. operations, where the bank owns Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp Inc., rose 6 percent to C$390 million ($291 million).\nEarnings from Mexico rose 4 percent to C$57 million ($42 million). Other international businesses contributed C$102 million ($76 million) to the bank's bottom line, up 1 percent from 1995.\nSpeaking to reporters, Barrett said the bank should meet or exceed 10 percent growth in annual earnings per share going forward.\n\"There is sufficient counter cyclicality built into the range of businesses and range of geographies that we're operating in now that we continue to feel that we would be able to maintain that 10 percent EPS growth or better in the years ahead,\" Barrett said.\nThe bank's earnings were generally in line with estimates.\nFourth quarter earnings rose to C$1.04 (77 cents) a share from 93 cents (69 cents) in the same period in 1995.\n\"They were a little weaker than what I was looking for, but pretty much in line for intents and purposes,\" said Kevin Choquette, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.\nChoquette had forecast fourth quarter earnings of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share.\nImproved credit quality also contributed to the bank's strong performance.

We've got enormous purchasing power,\" he added.\nMcDonald's operates more than 19,200 restaurants worldwide, including about 12,000 in the United States.\nWhile Greenberg joined McDonald's in 1982 as chief financial officer, he said he has field experience with its restaurants. \"I spent a year in the field in restaurants and became a regional manager for a year as well,\" Greenberg said.", "Australia's information technology and telecommunication industry (IT&T) on Tuesday welcomed a decision by Asia-Pacific leaders that would lead to a substantial reduction in tariffs.\n\"It is certainly welcome, as the telecommunications area has some very strong barriers in many markets,\" said Fleur Bayley, export manager of the Australian Informational Industry Association (AIIA).  \nBayley told Reuters that Australia has no trade barriers on IT&T equipment, whereas local companies have to compete in markets that have high tariff barriers.\nThe meeting in the Philippines of 18 leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies endorsed a United States plan to free the annual US$500 billion global trade in computers, memory chips and telecommunications equipment.\nHowever, most IT&T observers wanted more details about the tariff plan before they could assess its implications for the Australian sector.  \nOne computer industry analyst said the APEC plan is likely to benefit Australian IT&T exports, but is unlikely to stimulate growth of technology imports into Australia.\n\"One would have thought with the relative maturity of our market that exports could increase faster than imports,\" the analyst said.\nHe said there could be a mild boost in demand from home users of computers, but it is unlikely to affect the demand in the corporate market.  \nBut another analyst said most of Australia IT&T exports are from multinational corporations with operations in Australia and these companies are the ones that are most likely to benefit.\nAustralia exported more than A$2.5 billion in IT&T goods in the 12 months to September this year but imported around A$9.6 billion worth of IT&T goods over the same period.\nU.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp lBM exports about A$500 million of its computers from Australia to Asia, making it the country's single largest technology exporter.  \nFrench telecommunictaions equipment maker Alcatel Alsthom is another multinational with large export volumes from Australia.\nAIIA's Bayley said the association has a target of A$10 billion in IT&T exports by the year 2000.\nA decade ago, Australia's IT&T exports were negligible.", "U.S. high-tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose 25 percent in the seasonally-slow period from year-ago levels, according to a survey released on Friday.\n\"It is so hot it's scary,\" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.\nHigh-technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.\nSoftware investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.\nFor the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.\n\"Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,\" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.\nThe third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.\n\"Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second- quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,\" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association. \"But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.\nCompanies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.\nOn average startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.\nFunding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet- related companies receiving funding in the quarter exeeding the year-ago period by six times.\nIn a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.\nTypically the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.\n\"Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,\" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.", "Air Hong Kong Ltd (AHK) chief operating officer, Stanley Hui said the August 25 start of its first trans-Pacific service means the airline is now firmly headed in the right direction.\nThe head of Hong Kong's only all-cargo airline told Reuters in an interview said it was \"an important milestone towards a much brighter future.\"\nHowever Hui said the cargo carrier did not make any money in the first half of 1996 suffering, like many others, from low yields.\nLast year AHK made its first ever profit and although Hui would not disclose the exact amount, he said it was \"very healthy\" after \"huge losses\" in the past.\nFour years ago, things were so bad that the airline was just a telephone call away from going under, industry sources said.\nBut then a new management team was installed, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd came to the rescue by taking a 75 percent stake, loss-making routes were cut, old aircraft were retired and three newly converted Boeing 747-200s acquired, Hui added.\nThe new aircraft are able to carry 25 tons more tonnes than the carrier's old aircraft and complete with a new Chinese wheel company logo signifying brisk business, they began a twice weekly service to Chicago on August 25.\nWhen Air Hong Kong's third converted 747 leased from Cathay Pacific for 15 years joins the fleet in October, the Chicago service will become three times weekly.\nHui says the new route has been possible with the leasing of the three former combi 747s which formerly flew with the Brazilian airline Varig.\nThe aircraft, converted at Boeing facilities in Wichita, Kansas and at Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Ltd, will give AHK a much higher aircraft utilisation rate from 12 to 14 hours per day.\nAHK existing fleet of older 747s are being returned to the leasing company.\n\"We're talking about more expensive aeroplanes but they're more reliable, with better payload and can help save on maintenance so it's a good investment for this company.\"Hui said.\nCathay Pacific has handed its once weekly Chicago service over to AHK in order to concentrate on its own new twice weekly freighter service to New York which also started on August 24.\nThe new U.S. services have been made possible after a new air agreement was drawn up between the U.S. and Hong Kong government.\nAHK also fly to Dubai, Brussels and Manchester five times a week and twice weekly to Osaka. It has applied for a twice weekly service to Seoul in South Korea on Friday.\nHui said there has been a 20 per cent drop in cargo selling rates over the past six months.\n\"But I'm not surprised, the market is very competive, very seasonal and slow in the first half. We have seen a slower market this year consequently rates have dropped, tonnage is down, rates and yields are down but I think we are seeing a nice recovery. Developing for us and Chicago will help that. It is a very important gateway for us,\" Hui said.", "Three companies are expected to be left in the running for control of mutually-owned life insurance company Scottish Amicable at the deadline for final offers on Friday evening.\nInsurance groups Prudential Corp and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) and high street bank Abbey National have all been working on offers to be weighed up by the ScotAm board and its advisers SBC Warburg.\nA source close to Warburgs said a bidder from outside the three front-runers was not anticipated.\nThe sifting of the offers is likely to take place behind closed doors with not one of the likely bidders opting to make public details of its proposals.\nIn an effort to deflect criticism of the sealed-bid process ScotAm had agreed to publish details of offers, if required by a bidder.\nFor the moment, none have asked it to do so.\n\"We're not at this stage asking for our bid to be revealed. I think everybody's waiting to see whether anyone wants to have a shootout now - it's a bit of a stand off.... it's very much a case of playing by ScotAm's rules,\" said a source close to one of the bidders.\nThose rules include confidentiality agreements and an undertaking to accept the board's decision, expected by the end of the month, as final.\nScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the the takeover battle.\nThe board has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its 1.1 million policyholders will be uppermost in its final decision.\nThose interests are not limited to headline figures and upfront payouts but extend to the bidders long-term investment plans.\nOne of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing what are likely to be very differently structured proposals, and independent actuaries and the Department of Trade & Industry will be consulted before a decision is made.\nJob security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play its part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts at ScotAm.\nAMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life buisness to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.\nAMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.\nThe final price -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- is said to have deterred many from taking their interest further and Lloyds admitted recently that after running the slide rule over ScotAm, it felt the bid premium looked too high.\nBoth the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.\nAbbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.\nThose bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.\nAMP has not yet given any indication of what it might be prepared to pay for ScotAm, but is financially strong has said it was keen to make acquisitions in both the British and U.S. market.\n($ = 0.627 British Pounds)", "The French government, belatedly attempting to consolidate a fragmented aerospace industry, on Wednesday gave the green light for aero-engine maker Snecma to buy up rocket engine manufacturer SEP.\nState-owned Snecma already owns 51 percent of Societe Europeene de Propulsion (SEP) and wants to buy out minority shareholders to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary. The enlarged group would have annual sales of around 15 billion francs ($2.9 billion).\n\"The government has been advised of Snecma's wish to raise its holding in the capital of SEP from 51 percent to 100 percent and has given its approval so Snecma's board can make a public offer for SEP shares, followed by, if the 95 percent threshold is reached, a mandatory buy-in,\" the Finance Ministry said in a statement.\nThe deal has a strong industrial logic and would ensure Snecma's future in space programmes and its position as France's centre for engine manufacture, it said.\nSEP makes engines and boosters for Ariane rockets, used by the European Arianespace consortium.\nSnecma makes civilian and military aero engines including those for passenger jets of the Airbus Industrie consortium and Dassault Aviation combat planes.\nThe buy-in, for which no financial details were available, reverses a policy drawn up by Snecma's previous chairman, Bernard Dufour, who wanted to dispose of SEP and Messier Bugatti, Snecma's aircraft brakes unit, to raise cash.\n\"Previously envisaged, the sale of SEP is no longer on the agenda\", said a Snecma staff note made available to Reuters.\nAlthough the SEP sale would have brought in fresh cash, it also risked weakening the Snecma group by losing know-how essential for future transports such as a second generation supersonic plane and hypersonic aircraft, the note said.\nIt would also have meant the loss for SEP of Snecma's technical support, which has helped it in the past.\nSnecma's new chairman, Jean Paul Bechat, has said asset sales should not be used to make up operating losses and that the company's deficits would only be tackled by meeting a targeted 1.5 billion francs in cost cuts in a restructuring plan.\nIn addition, the government has adopted an industrial policy for the defence sector which relies on consolidating each sector on a business basis. Snecma was thus the natural centre for SEP, to build a propulsion group in aeronautics and space, it said.\nThe move would also consolidate Snecma's brakes activities by bringing together SEP's Carbone-Industrie subsidiary with Snecma's Messier Bugatti to create a bigger entity.\nBrakes make up around eight percent of Snecma's sales, with potential to grow into areas such as cars and trains.\nThe buyout will help SEP through a difficult period in the next few years as its order book falls when the Arianespace space consortium transfers launches to the new Ariane 5 rocket from the existing Ariane 4.\nSEP makes the rocket motors for the Ariane 5, which has one huge Vulcain engine instead of the up to 10 Viking and HM 7 motors in Ariane 4. Competition from the United States, Russia, Ukraine, China and Japan is also expected to put severe price pressure on rocket launchers.\nSEP also makes ballistic missiles and its proposed M5 replacement for the M45 was only adopted in the six-year defence budget on condition that there would be big cost reductions and reorganisations among the industrial partners.\nThe takeover will create a group with synergies in aeronautical and space engines, making it virtually unique in Europe, a Snecma spokesman said.\nSnecma made a 1995 net loss of 1.24 billion francs and expects to make a loss in 1996 and next year before returning to profit in 1998. Turnover for 1996 is expected to total 9.2 billion francs, up from 8.6 billion in 1995 but still lower than 1994's 10.39 billion.", "Two years ago, China's second telephone network set out to challenge the powerful Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and bring competition into the country's a fast-growing market.\nBut the fledgling network has found it hard to tackle a seasoned competitor -- one that is also the market regulator.\n\"Are they (the MPT) supposed to be the referee or one of the athletes on the playing field?\" asks Li Huifen, president of China United Telecommunications Corp, also known as Unicom.\nThe arrival of Unicom and the end of the MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost for China's long-suffering telephone subscribers, who often had to wait up to a year for a telephone line and endure indifferent service afterwards.\nBut Unicom has captured only a tiny slice of the market as its entrenched competitor has kept a tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advance.\n\"They have delayed interconnections and won't give us telephone numbers for our customers,\" Li said in an interview. \"We need a telecommunications law to give us a legal framework.\"\nUnicom has 16 shareholders, but the key backers of the project were the ministries of electronics industry (MEI), power and railways.\nMANUFACTURING MUSCLE\nThe MEI has manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories producing telecommunications equipment. But it feared the MPT's equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.\nThe other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT's public network was heavily overcrowded.\nThe feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.\nThose frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.\nChina expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation's 1.2 billion people.\nMPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.\n\"Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,\" said an MPT spokesman. \"The MPT is not both regulating and competing,\" he said, blaming Unicom's slow progress on its own technical problems.\nSTRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL\nBut China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins. And even if they can draw the line cleanly, the MPT must struggle to remain impartial.\n\"They always say they are being fair,\" said Unicom's Li. \"But China Telecom is their own child, and parents are always partial to their own children.\"\nLi took up the Unicom reins in August, becoming the third president in the company's brief history. She was tapped from her job as deputy mayor of the big industrial city of Tianjin to put political clout behind the second network.\nThe company started with mobile telephone services, first in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, and eventually expanded to 16 cities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai where it has about 20,000 mobile phone customers, Li said.\n\"In 10 years we will have 10 percent of the fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market,\" Li said.\nOne clear success has been in bringing mobile telephone prices down. They now cost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compared with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came along.\nLi says Unicom is profitable on its operations, but that excludes heavy investments in building network infrastructure. Despite the cost of putting a network in place, Unicom has one advantage. Foreigners are not permitted to operate telecommunications networks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom capital in return for a share of the income.\nThat will at least ease the growing pains for the infant network, analysts said.", "Talks aimed at averting a Chinese ban on imports of United States poultry have been hailed as a success by U.S. officials, who said on Friday they expected the issue to vanish without any disruption to a major market.\nA Chinese ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states, worth nearly US$500 million a year, was now unlikely to be implemented, official U.S. sources said.\n\"I'm optimistic that the issue has been resolved,\" a U.S. diplomat in Beijing said by telephone.\n\"Hopefully, this thing will now be dropped. I'm not expecting any correspondence or a list -- sometimes no news is good news,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\nA two-man team from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) spent two days in meetings with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) and scientists from other government departments and universities.\nThe aim of the talks was to convince CAPQ that U.S. poultry does not carry a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), contrary to Chinese fears that led to the ban.\n\"We are hopeful this issue has been resolved,\" said Ray Miyamoto, the APHIS area director in Beijing. \"We feel their (CAPQ's) primary concerns were adequately addressed.\"\nMiyamoto added that CAPQ planned to write a report that may or may not be made available to APHIS.\nThe meetings ended on Thursday. CAPQ was not immediately available for comment.\nU.S. sources described the talks as \"frank, open and candid\" and said they augured well for other discussions slated for November on plant quarantine issues.\nWheat, however, remains shrouded in politics. Washington claims a Chinese ban on accepting wheat from specific U.S. areas because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut is, in effect, a non-tariff trade barrier.\nA top-level Chinese delegation is due to leave for the United States this weekend for a two-week TCK fact-finding trip.\nThe poultry ban came to light on October 10 after U.S. chicken meat imports were blocked. CAPQ confirmed it to U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing the next day in a telephone call.\nNothing was ever received in writing from CAPQ, a source at the embassy said on Friday, and the ban was not implemented as CAPQ wanted first to hear what the U.S. experts had to say.\nWhat the experts said, according to sources close to the meetings, was that HPAI, while widespread in wildfowl, was eradicated from commercial U.S. flocks in the mid-1980s.\nThe U.S. side seemed convinced that CAPQ had confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which an APHIS source likened to the common cold.\nAnother U.S. source said the Chinese fears had been fuelled during a visit to Texas by CAPQ personnel to check on ostrich breeding stock destined for farms in southern China.\nA number of birds there tested positive for HPAI, the source said, though this did not necessarily mean they were afflicted with the virus.\nChina is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and its only market for chicken feet.\nU.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.\nThe council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China every day.", "Boeing Co. is expected to use the biennial Farnborough Air Show in England next week to formally launch the long-awaited stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, industry analysts say.\nWhile officials of the aerospace giant remain tight-lipped, analysts say it is all but certain executives will make a major announcement on Monday regarding two new members of the 747 family that will be known as the 747-500 and 747-600.\n\"They're going to announce the airplanes -- there is no doubt,\" said Joe Campbell, an analyst at Lehman Bros.\nHe said the only question was whether Boeing would announce massive orders of $10 billion or more from launch customers or merely disclose that its board of directors had given authorization to offer the jet.\nThe announcement of the new models, which would include a jet with 30 percent more capacity than today's largest commercial airliner, is expected to be the highlight of the air show, frequently the stage for major order announcements and other industry news.\nBoeing officials have said they are talking with at least six airlines about the potential new versions of the jumbo jet, including British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.\nBoeing President Phil Condit said the company's board of directors discussed the new plane at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday but had not made a decision on whether to launch it.\n\"That will depend on airline orders,\" he said in a brief interview Tuesday.\nSpecifications being circulated within the industry call for the 747-600 to hold 548 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of up to 8,900 miles (14,300 km), compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles (13,500 km) for the current-generation 747-400.\nThe long-range 747-500 would hold 462 passengers in three classes and have a range of up to 10,000 miles (16,000 km).\nAnalysts say the 747 stretch is essential for Boeing to continue dominating the lucrative top end of the market -- which it has had to itself since the introduction of the four-engine jumbo jet in 1970, which nearly bankrupted the company.\nNow Boeing's own new 777 twin-engine jet is replacing older 747s, and possible new versions of jets from rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. could threaten the lower end of the jumbo market.\n\"They really do need to be able to move up to again have a position of complete monopoly for the aircraft as they have had for a number of years,\" said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.\nMeanwhile Airbus has signaled that it intends to go ahead with plans for its own all-new 550-seat plane, dubbed the 3XX, although analysts question whether the market for jumbo jets is big enough for two manufacturers.\n\"From an economic point of view, I don't think there's enough demand to justify the $10 (billion) to $15 billion cost\" of an all-new jet, said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.\nHe and other analysts said they expect air travel in the fast-growing Pacific region to follow the Atlantic in migrating to pairs of smaller cities rather than routes between world capitals that require the largest jets.\nThe trend toward such more thinly traveled routes was among the reasons cited by Boeing when it shelved a project to jointly develop with Airbus a double-decker airliner that would hold up to 800 passengers.\nBut Lehman's Campbell predicted Europe's Airbus, which is transforming itself from a consortium into a single company, would go ahead with its own jumbo jet for commercial delivery in 2003, about three years after Boeing's new 747 models.\n\"They're not going to leave Boeing alone at the upper end,\" he said.\nCampbell estimated that Boeing's 747 revision, which would include a new wing, new engines and possible new cockpit electronics, would cost from $5 billion to $8 billion to develop.\nRolls-Royce Plc has said it plans to offer a variant of its Trent turbofan engine to power the new Boeing craft, while rivals General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit have formed a joint venture to develop an alternative power plant.", "Virginia-based Dominion Resources Inc., continuing an American invasion of the recently privatised utility industry in Britain, agreed Wednesday to acquire East Midlands Electricity Plc for about 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion).\nExecutives from Dominion met East Midlands management late Tuesday to offer 6.7 pounds ($11.07) a share for one of five remaining independent electric companies in Britain.\nBut East Midlands shares languished well below the offer price Wednesday as concerns emerged that the bid might face obstacles from British competition authorities.\n\"Everyone's expecting the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) to take a close look at the deal,\" said one trader.\nDominion, based in Richmond, Va., said last week it was considering a bid \"at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share.\" But East Midlands scorned that price, saying it would undervalue the Nottingham-based electricity company.\nEast Midlands Chairman Sir Nigel Rudd said Wednesday that his board was recommending the latest offer \"because it represents fair value for an excellent business, which has successfully differentiated itself from the sector.\"\nSeven of Britain's original 12 regional electricity companies have already been bought -- four by U.S. firms -- since they came up for grabs last March when the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.\n\"Dominion's offer looks a fair compromise price,\" said Chris Perry, utilities analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.\nBut he added that there were \"very genuine concerns\" that the offer might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.\nDominion Chief Financial Officer Linwood Robertson said in an interview that the company was talking to the regulator.\n\"We intend to run this as a stand-alone business,\" he said, adding that he certainly hoped for approval.\nHe also said the group hoped to keep East Midlands' management team, which is highly regarded by industry analysts.\nRobertson said Dominion looked forward to the diversification East Midlands would bring to it and said the U.S. company would bring strengths to the British firm.\nDominion's stock gained 37.5 cents to $40.125 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "A Chinese court took less than four hours on Wednesday to convict prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced him to 11 years in prison.\nThe Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court found Wang guilty of conspiring to subvert the Chinese government, the Xinhua news agency said. He faced a maximum penalty of death.\n\"Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,\" Xinhua quoted the judge as saying after the trial.\nWang, 27, was also deprived of his political rights for two years, Xinhua said, quoting the verdict.\n\"Wang candidly confessed his activities,\" Xinhua said, adding that he received funds from overseas hostile forces, gave financial aid to families of jailed dissidents and tried to set up an \"opposition force\" by uniting illegal organisations.\nCharges against Wang were backed by testimony by another dissident, Liu Xiaobo, Xinhua said. It did not elaborate. Liu was sent this month to a labour camp for three years.\n\"His criminal fact is clear, and the evidence is conclusive,\" Xinhua said quoting the verdict against Wang. \"He instigated people by saying that'It is time we turn our words into actions'.\"\nThe verdict was issued just four hours after the trial began. Foreign reporters and legal experts were barred from attending the trial in western Beijing.\nSecurity was tight around the court building, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building.\nEarlier on Wednesday, the dissident's father said the family would appeal if Wang were convicted.\n\"We will definitely appeal.... We will not give in,\" Wang Xianzeng told reporters just hours before the start of the proceedings.\n\"He is definitely innocent,\" he said as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court.\n\"Speech can't overthrow the government,\" he said.\nWang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, attended the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister were allowed to sit in.\nWang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.\nThe mother had said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.\nWang Dan faced a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.\nThe New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.\nHuman Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.\nHe was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.\nChina has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.", "Shares in Britain's second biggest supermarket chain J. Sainsbury Plc rose on Wednesday after the group held out hope of an improved performance despite a fall in half year profits and sluggish sales.\n\"The share price rise is a triumph of hope over statistics,\" said one sector analyst.\nSainsbury, which last year was overtaken as market leader by arch-rival Tesco, said half year pre-tax profits slipped, as analysts expected, to 393 million pounds ($637.4 million) from 456 million pounds in the same period last year.\nSainsbury also announced a dividend of 3.5 pence per share, up from 3.4 pence.\nThe company suffered its first fall in full year profits in 22 years when it reported in May. Pre-tax earnings before exceptional items fell 5.5 percent to 764 million pounds in the business year to March 9, 1996.\nAfter Wednesday's results, several analysts cut forecasts for the current full year to 710-725 million pounds, a level some analysts were already predicting, market sources said.\nBut shares closed up 8.5 pence to 363.5 pence, in a market which was generally easier after an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates.\nThe group said current sales from comparable stores, excluding petrol, were rising in line with inflation of around three percent, well below the 7.5-percent gain reported by Tesco in September.\nA sector analyst who asked not to be named said \"Sales moving in line with inflation is pretty disappointing, considering they've introduced the loyalty card.\"\nThe Reward card is now accounting for much of the increase in sales Sainsbury is currently seeing.\n\"Clearly, we want to do better (than three percent)\", chairman David Sainsbury told Reuters. \"This year will be about getting the basics right, next year will be about getting profits moving.\"\nThe company said marketing and operations initiatives along with the Reward card

to build a legitimate music industry.\nEuropean companies were eager to establish cooperative ventures with local firms that would allow them to supply music to a vast listening audience currently largely supplied from illicit music production lines, the executives said.\n\"The Chinese market has enormous potential,\" EMI Europe President Rupert Perry told reporters in Beijing, adding that China was making progress in its crackdown on piracy.\nBeijing vowed to clamp down on pirates and prise open its cultural markets in a June agreement with the United States that narrowly averted a multibillion dollar cross-Pacific trade war over violations of intellectual property rights.\nAnalysts and some industry figures have cast doubt on China's commitment to wipe out piracy, but the music executives said they had been encouraged by their talks with Chinese copyright and publishing officials.\n\"Our conversations with Chinese officials in the last couple of days lead us to believe that they are very cognisant of the problem and doing everything that they can to control it,\" said Perry.\n\"The laws are in place, they have an understanding of what has to happen and yes, they have had successes in closing certain factories,\" he said. \"We believe that will continue.\"\nThe executives, who are part of a trade delegation to China led by European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, said they hoped to build an industry that would develop Chinese musical talent for a domestic and international audience.\nThe multimillion dollar Chinese music market had the potential to grow 10-fold over the next few years, industry officials in the delegation said.\n\"We.... tried to explain to the Chinese what we could do together,\" said Polygram Far East president Norman Cheng, \"They have been pretty receptive to all these ideas.\"\n\"This is our first round of meetings,\" said Michael Smellie, senior vice president of BMG Entertainment International Asia Pacific. \"We were encouraged.\"\nMusic imports into China were still negligible, while pirate sales were estimated at $170 million a year, roughly equivalent to the value of legitimate sales, said Adrian Strain of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).\nEuropean music companies were looking for Chinese partners to develop the local market, with former pirate firms among the potential wedding partners, the executives said.\nWhile it was impossible to wipe out piracy with a single campaign, Beijing's crackdown on illicit production had worried illegal producers and had forced them to shift some production lines to Vietnam and even South America, IFPI officials said.", "The watchdogs of China's ruling Communist Party have ordered members to obey a call from party chief Jiang Zemin for ideological orthodoxy -- or face disciplinary punishment, state media said on Saturday.\n\"The work style of the ruling party is a matter of life and death,\" the People's Daily quoted a decision by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China as saying after a meeting this week.\nThe commission also issued a call for clean government, warning of the threat of corruption to continued party rule.\n\"Party organisations and members should conscientiously carry on the party's fine traditions and work style,\" it said.\nThe statement was issued two days after the party wound up its annual policy-making plenum with a pledge to boost orthodox socialist values that have been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.\n\"Anyone who violates the sixth plenum's decisions, or who disobeys orders, or engages in harmful activities against socialist ethical and cultural progress, should be strictly disciplined,\" the discipline commission said.\nThe party plenum had said spiritual civilisation -- Chinese communist jargon for ideological orthodoxy and toeing the party line -- could not be sacrificed in the name of the economic reforms spearheaded by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\nThe commission echoed the plenum's call for a return to the communist puritanism espoused by the late Chairman Mao Zedong.\n\"The work style of close links to the masses, criticism and self-criticism, hard work, and building a clean and honest government should also be continued,\" the commission said.\nThe ruling party has seen its credibility undermined in recent years after the chaos of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and as loopholes for corruption opened up by economic reform have tempted many senior party officials.\n\"The crackdown on corruption is one of the important tasks of improving the party's work style and clean government and for promoting ethical and cultural progress,\" the commission said.\nIt called on party committees throughout China to intensify their battle against corruption and to severely punish those found guilty of corruption.\nJiang, who is also state president, has warned repeatedly that corruption is a virus that threatens to topple the party.\nJiang had been expected to seize on the plenum as the last chance before a crucial congress in 1997 to underline his role as anointed heir to Deng Xiaoping, who has been fading gradually from the scene, diplomats and Chinese sources said.\nHe has made clear that he wants to place his stamp on ideology in China.\nThe party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, has filled its front page for several days with examples of model workers whose socialist values the populace at large should strive to emulate.\nAmong these is

The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.\nWoodside is an equal 16.66 percent shareholder in the project along with some of the world's major oil producers.\nThe Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.\nHowever, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.\n\"The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal,\" Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there were lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the expansion proposal.\n\"Following that, would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998,\" Wedgwood said.\nOnly after this agreement would work start on the expansion.\nThe other partners in the North West Shelf are Australia's The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, British Petroleum Plc, Chevron Inc of the United States, and Japanese groups Mitsui & Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.\nRoyal Dutch/Shell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.", "A fast-selling product that allows grannies all across America to exchange electronic mail securely with their families may become a key weapon in challenging the U.S. government's tight encryption policies.\nComputer industry executives said the strong encryption which startup USWeb Networks is delivering on hundreds of thousands of television-based Internet browsing devices is still prohibited from export by U.S. Cold War munitions laws.\nExecutives at Palo Alto, Calif.-based WebTV said they chose to use the strongest coding standard available to give consumers the assurance their communications would be kept confidential.\n\"The only way we felt we could guarantee the level of security we felt was uncrackable by anyone...was if we were essentially using CIA-class security procedures,\" said Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV Networks.\nWebTV uses 128-bit encryption, based on coded'keys' with 128 characters of information, the same level of coding used in some of the most secretive U.S. government communications.\n\"It's very similar to what they use when they're communicating with cruise missiles,\" Perlman said.\nThis is a useful fact to point out in reassuring potential customers they can both communicate and pay for goods and services securely over the Internet, he added.\n\"They love it. They really love it, beause now they can just relax and forget about it,\" he said. Using a credit card number over WebTV's encrypted communications is safer than reading it over a telephone, which can be tapped, he argues.\n\"While the FBI can get your credit card that way (over the telephone), they can't get it through WebTV,\" he said.\nPerhaps equally excited about the decision by WebTV to use such strong encryption is the Silicon Valley high tech business community, which has been deadlocked in a battle with the Clinton administration over encryption restrictions.\nLaws against the export of encryption date back to the start of the Cold War, when earlier versions of coding were considered vital to national security and were classified as munitions explicitly barred from export.\nTop computer executives now say the use of encryption in relatively normal, consumer-oriented applications such as WebTV is a perfect example why they feel the government's efforts to restrict the technology should ultimately fail.\n\"Without commenting specifically on WebTV, I can tell you that the government is fighting essentially a losing battle here,\" said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems Inc.\n\"What's happened is that the technology is now so ubiquitous and there are so many people using it that the current law...really needs to be scrapped.\"\nIn addition to the need for U.S. businesses to have strong encryption to secure their own systems when operating overseas, the computer industry argues that competitors in other countries are being given an open market to sell higher levels of encryption U.S. companies are barred from selling.\nBut Washington insists that law enforcement authorities must have a means of breaking into encoded messages to investigate criminal activity.\nThe Administration recently offered a compromise where companies could export modestly strong'keys,' less powerful than those used by WebTV, as long as they could be recovered by authorities to crack codes after obtaining a court warrant.\nIndustry is not pleased with the idea.\nIt would be difficult, and unduly expensive, to administer and is unlikely to be acceptable to foreign customers who might not consider the U.S. government to have a right to break into their confidential communications, many argue.\n\"Our personal view is that the notion of key recovery is something that's not going to be very acceptable, particularly to other countries -- the notion that the U.S. government would be able to recover the keys,\" said Deborah Triant, chief executive of Check Point Software Technologies, Inc.\nIn the meantime, however, WebTV will be prohibited except by special license from exporting its devices, which are being sold by consumer electronics manufacturers Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV through retail stores.\nIn fact, the issue came to light publicly following a letter from one of the manufacturers to its distributors, warning not to export the machines due to the munitions laws.\n\"It would definitely be unfortunate if sombedy was to carry one over the border,\" said Perlman, adding the WebTV boxes have more computing power than the world's most powerful supercomputer -- Cray Reasearch's XMP-48 -- did in 1987.\n\"That was a $50 million computer in 1987. This is a $300 computer and it outperforms the Cray,\" he said.\nWebTV has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp. and a unit of US West Inc..\n\"This WebTV is the first of many we're going to see where legitimate customers really do need very strong encryption for things involving really normal day-to-day use,\" said Schmidt.", "Japan's Finance Ministry, which has long resisted calls from employers to reform the country's rigid corporate pension system, has finally decided to relax its tight grip.\nHowever, industry sources say its proposals fall short of what is needed to cope with Japan's rapidly \"greying\" society and the poor financial state of employee pension funds resulting from record-low interest rates and a weak economic recovery.\n\"Unless Japan undertakes a drastic overhaul of the corporate pension system, it will remain out of step with the rest of the world,\" said an official at an overseas-based investment advisory company.\nIn the past, the amount of money Japanese corporate pension funds held was so small that authorities could regulate them without too much difficulty. But the amount has grown to about 60 trillion yen ($540 billion) and unless the current system is changed, it will hurt corporate balance sheets, he said.\nYoshihiko Miyauchi, a key member of an advisory panel to the prime minister, said on Thursday that the Finance Ministry had stated in a subcommittee meeting on deregulation that it would abolish restrictions on where employee pension funds managed by trust banks could be invested.\nUnder the current rules, each trust bank must invest at least half of the funds it manages in fixed-income assets, no more than 30 percent in Japanese stocks, no more than 30 percent in foreign currency-denominated shares and bonds, and no more than 20 percent in real estate.\nJapan's corporate pension system is divided into employee pension funds, which are supervised by the Welfare Ministry, and Tax-Qualified Retirement Pension plans (TQPs), which are supervised by the Finance Ministry.\nMiyauchi said the Finance Ministry was still considering whether to allow investment advisory firms to manage TQPs. It also told the subcommittee that it was studying whether to allow variable yields and flexible benefits, he said.\nThe Welfare Ministry has steadily lifted its restrictions on the management on employee pension funds, which have assets estimated at 42 trillion yen ($378 billion), and allowed investment advisory firms to manage the funds.\nHowever, the Finance Ministry has barred investment advisory firms from managing TQPs, which have assets totalling 18 trillion yen ($162 billion). Only trust banks and life insurers are allowed to manage TQPs.\nEmployers participating in the corporate pension system are required to maintain specified yields, currently 5.5 percent a year, to guarantee predetermined benefits. But the actual return on investments is now only about three percent.\nBecause of the poor investment environment, many corporate pension funds are facing a shortage of funds to pay benefits to pensioners in the future, industry sources said. If pension funds fall short of meeting future payments, sponsoring companies must cover the shortfall.\nIndustry sources said that investment advisory firms, especially foreign companies, are keen to manage TQPs.\n\"Generally speaking, fund managers at Japanese companies are conservative,\" said the official with the investment advisory company.\n\"They tend to avoid investment risks because they see the risks, which are short-term volatility, as something dangerous. But experienced foreign advisors are well-qualified to manage pension funds as they take reasonable risks in long-term pension fund management over 20- to 30-year periods,\" he said.\nHe said British pension funds invest about 90 percent of their assets in equities, including about 15 percent in foreign stocks.\nKen Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd, said in a recent report that if Japan completely abolished restrictions on asset management of corporate pension funds, it was likely to see more investment in local stocks.\nHe estimated that at the moment, life insurers and trust banks put an average of about 20 percent of the pension assets they are entrusted with into local stocks.", "Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday reported that News Corp Ltd had performed below expectations in the first quarter, but he said the global media group was still on track for a 20-percent profit rise this year.\nMurdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp, also unveiled a more conservative approach to financing new acquisitions.\n\"I am on record as saying that we expect a 20-percent increase in profit for the year,\" Murdoch told a packed News Corp annual meeting in Adelaide.\n\"We still expect that and are still aiming for that during the coming year. However, I should say that the first quarter may not be quite up to those expectatations, but we will certainly be striving to make up any shortfall,\" Murdoch said.\nAnalysts viewed the comments as disappointing and said they were now more sceptical about the 20-percent profit pledge.\n\"If they can't meet expectations in the first quarter, when they have those strong revenues from Independence Day, then what hope do they have of getting 20 percent in the full year?\" asked one Sydney-based media analyst referring to a hit Hollywood movie made by News Corp's Fox studio.\nTraders on the Australian share market did not like the first quarter comment either, selling the shares 14 cents or almost two percent lower to close at A$7.20, while the broader Australian equity market closed at a new record high.\nIn the 1995/96 year ended June 30, News Corp's net profit slipped to A$1.02 billion ($806 million) from A$1.37 billion in 1994/95.\nMurdoch said revenues at the Fox U.S. television business had begun 1996/97 slowly because of of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the rights to which were held by a rival network.\nAustralian newspaper revenues would be flat in 1996/97, said Murdoch.\nBut he remained buoyant about News' British operations, saying the advertising market there was booming and the partly-owned BSkyB pay television operators was growing strongly.\nMurdoch then unveiled a more cautious strategy for financing future expansion.\n\"As far as possible, we will finance them (News' expansion plans) out of current cash flow to maintain liquidity so that we will be ready to take new opportunities as they arise,\" he said.\nNews has often funded its aggressive growth in pay television and other media through either hefty debt or equity issues, which have sometimes met shareholder resistance. It almost collapsed under a debt mountain in the early 1990s.\nAnalysts said the comments indicated a more conservative approach towards acquisitions and their financing and would be welcomed by the market.\n\"It imposes a huge financial discipline on the company which would hearten people immensely,\" said another analyst.\nMurdoch also announced that News planned to float its British-based digital media technology company, Digital Media Services, within the next two to three weeks and would sell 20 percent of the company.\nDigital Media Services, a combination of News Data Comm and Digi-Media Vision Ltd, would operate in Britain and Israel and produce technology for digital television.\nNews Corp traditionally holds its annual meetings here in Adelaide, the South Australia city where Rupert Murdoch's father Keith founded the beginnings of the News Corp empire.", "Britain on Thursday opened its doors to 44 new international telephone operators, saying it would create a fully open long-distance telecommunications market 12 months ahead of the rest of Europe.\nU.S. telecoms giant AT&T, Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel and the Global One alliance between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint are now among those free to compete against dominant players British Telecommunications (BT) and Mercury.\nWhile the rest of Europe is only aiming for telecom liberalisation in 1998, a rash of new rivals -- mainly from the United States -- will be able to offer a full range of telecoms services between Britain and the rest of the world from January 1, 1997.\n\"The UK has proved to the world that liberalisation pushes down prices and improves services,\" Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor said in a statement.\n\"Phone prices are down 40 percent overall since 1984, and I expect these new licensees to put further downward pressure on international rates,\" added Taylor, who is keen for a more open telecommunications market to attract inward investment.\nIn the largest single move towards opening up the international telecom market, which BT values at just under 2.0 billion pounds ($3.33 billion), 46 companies applied for licences in July, 44 of which have now been granted.\nUntil now, international rivals to BT and Mercury -- which is owned by Britain's second largest telecoms operator Cable and Wireless -- have only been able to operate by paying to lease lines from two British companies.\nBut own-facilities services are cheaper to provide.\nThe move may also help dampen opposition by AT&T, America's largest long-distance carrier, to BT's proposed $20 billion merger with America's MCI Communications Corp.\nRegulatory clearance hinges on how open the authorities deem Britain's telecom market is. With BT keen to take on the U.S., the world's largest telecoms market -- worth about $200 billion -- regulators are keen to ensure that the same competitive benefits are available to U.S. companies.\nBT welcomed its new rivals, adding that it was hopeful of winning approval for its U.S. mega-merger. \"This (move) indicates how open the UK market is,\" a spokesman said.\nAnalysts say that expectations of growing competition and the inevitable falling margins at home have already been discounted in telecom companies' share prices.\n\"This has been very well flagged,\" noted one.\nMobile telephone operator Vodafone Group, having clinched its licence, jumped 6.5 pence to 246.5p.\nBT's shares rose four pence to 397p and Cable and Wireless' stock added 1/2p 474.5 pence by early afternoon.\nAnalysts have found it hard to predict how hard revenues will be hit by BT and Mercury's loss of market share as telecoms companies turn their attention overseas to help boost earnings.\nBut Cable and Wireless' Mercury is expected to suffer more than BT because international traffic makes up a much higher proportion of traffic -- and thus contributes a higher proportion of profits.", "Quick & Reilly Group Inc sees revenues possibly doubling to as much as $120 million by early 1998 at the OTC market-maker, Nash, Weiss & Co, the pioneering discount broker is buying, top Quick executives said on Wednesday.\nThe firm also plans to move Nash, Weiss, now largely a market maker for retail brokerages, into the institutional side of the business by adding 1,000 or more issues to its current 2,500 roster, Quick President Thomas Quick told Reuters.  \n\"This gives us another major leg,\" said Leslie Quick III, the president's brother and head of the discount-brokerage's U.S. Clearing Corp subsidiary. \"We expect this Nasdaq market maker business to be a fourth leg for us.\"\nBest known as a retail broker, Quick & Reilly is also a significant force in backroom processing of Wall Street trading and owner of the JCC Specialist Corp, the second largest market-maker, or specialist firm, on the New York Stock Exchange.\nEarlier, the firm agreed to acquire Nash Weiss, a market maker of 2,500 Nasdaq issues, for an undisclosed amount.  \n\"That number will probably go to 3,500 to 4,000,\" Leslie Quick III said.\nThe brothers, whose father, chairman Leslie Quick Jr, co-founded the firm in the early 1970s, said the mightily improved  capitalization of Nash, Weiss after the merger with Quick & Reilly will make it much more attractive to large institutional clients.\n\"Right now, they are on the retail side,\" said Leslie Quick III. \"They are probably the fifth or sixth largest. We think we can take the business into the top three. With our balance sheet, we can go after institutions.\"  \nThomas Quick said the leading market-maker for institutional clients had capitalization of about $80 million, or 20 times or more that of Nash Weiss.\nThe brothers said they expect revenues at Nash, Weiss, to rise dramatically as long as stock trading remains robust and may even double by the end of fiscal year 1998. The company's fiscal year ends on the last day of February.\nNash, Weiss will be run as a separate subsidiary remaining in Jersey City, New Jersey, and no job cuts or restructurings were planned, the brothers said.\nShares of Quick & Reilly were up 1/8 to 331/4.", "China's state refiner Sinopec is pushing through a series of measures to alleviate diesel shortages that have sparked a bizarre rise in prices in the country since late 1996, Chinese oil sources said this week.\nAfter two successive rises in official diesel prices in the fourth quarter of 1996, Sinopec's Beijing headquarters is now urging its almost 40 refineries to increase the cut of diesel from every barrel of crude they refine.\n\"Gas oil (diesel) has been in short supply in the country as a whole since the fourth quarter of last year,\" a well-placed Sinopec source said by telephone from Beijing.\n\"As for Sinopec, we are trying to regulate the production of gas oil as against gasoline to meet market demand,\" he said.\nThe current gasoline/diesel production ratio stands at 1:1.3 for almost all of China's refineries. But Sinopec in Beijing is pushing for a more suitable ratio of 1:1.4, the source said, adding that the change would take some months to materialise.\nDiesel import quotas, which were not fully utilised in 1996 due to high international prices, might also have exacerbated the shortage in the supply chain, and China might be forced to import more this year, the Sinopec source said.\nHe declined to estimate the amount of diesel likely to be imported this year.\nThe plan to raise domestic diesel output comes after two officially sanctioned price rises in late 1996 to encourage refiners to produce more diesel, Chinese oil sources said.\nDomestic diesel prices had been frozen at 1,900 yuan per tonne since May 1994, when Beijing imposed strict price ceilings to crack down on profiteering. Prices were raised to 1,990 yuan per tonne in October 1996 and 2,190 yuan per tonne in December.\nWhile Beijing, fearful of inflation, keeps a watch on prices, Chinese oil sources admit there is little central authorities can do to prevent flagrant price spikes in far-flung provinces hit by shortages.\n\"In situations of shortage, provinces can raise prices, it is difficult for Beijing to control,\" the Sinopec source said.\nHowever, some Chinese sources said earlier this week that shortages might only be isolated to some inland provinces as some coastal regions were still enjoying high inventories.\n\"Storage levels are healthy in some areas,\" said a Singapore-based trader with Chinese state oil trader Sinochem.\nStorage terminals at some coastal regions were at full capacity after importers sucked in a massive 1.9 million tonnes that started arriving from mid-January, a Sinopec source in Singapore said.\n\"Central authorities were afraid there wouldn't be enough for spring and even refiners were urged to crank up their gas oil production,\" he said.\nAuthorities might have frozen import quotas for now -- until the bottleneck clears -- but it was likely to be short term because China was short of diesel for this year, he added.\nA Chinese oil trader from the southern Maoming refinery, China's second largest, said diesel prices had hit as high as 5,000 yuan per tonne in some provinces suffering shortages.\n\"Prices were between 4,000 and even 5,000 yuan in December in places like Hunan and Sichuan,\" the trader said by telephone earlier this week. Refineries raised prices because their net costs had increased.\nChinese refiners have had sharply reduced profit margins since Beijing raised domestic crude prices by about 110 yuan in January 1996 to between 864 and 794 yuan a tonne on 80 percent of its crude sold within the country.\nFearful of an inflationary backlash, Beijing had, until October, kept prices of all oil products unchanged. Sinopec, which made exceptional profits in 1995 and 1994, bore the brunt of the rise in crude prices.\n\"Refining margins last year, compared with the earlier two years, were very bad. A lot of our profit went to our upstream companies,\" the Sinopec source said.", "More than 100 politicians, including half of today's lawmakers, have sought seats on a controversial Beijing-controlled legislature in a move that may cripple Hong Kong's parliament in the twilight of British rule.\nBefore a registration deadline on Monday, 112 people had applied to join the \"provisional legislature\", among them 33 members of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco).\nHong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30, and Beijing is pressing ahead -- despite British objections -- on setting up a provisional interim legislature to replace the elected Legco at the handover.\nThe provisional legislature will be selected on December 21.\nThe territory of 6.3 million people now faces a bizarre prospect of having two legislatures for the final six months of British rule -- one elected, legal and active, and a shadow \"selected\" chamber vulnerable to courtroom battles.\nThe number of seats on Legco and the new body is the same -- 60. An official of the China-controlled committee supervising the three-week registration process said 217 people had requested application forms, so there could be more contenders at the last minute.\nAmong 33 incumbent lawmakers who have applied are Legco speaker Andrew Wong, whose bid startled the political community last weekend and sparked fears that Legco could disintegrate.\n\"Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the provisional legislature will widen in the next six months,\" said political commentator Chris Yeung.\n\"When you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there's going to be some confusion and dispute,\" said analyst Michael DeGolyer of Hong Kong's Baptist University.\nThose wanting a seat in the new chamber also include 11 ex-lawmakers and 22 former election contestants defeated in 1995 elections in which pro-democracy groups led by the Democratic Party fared strongly.\nThe 1995 losers applying for a seat include prominent pro-Beijing politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Peggy Lam and Elsie Tu.\nApplicants also include 47 newcomers to legislative contests, many of whom are members of the hand-picked 150-member Preparatory Committee crafting the post-1997 Hong Kong power structures on behalf of China's communist rulers.\nOther newcomers are members of the 400-strong Selection Committee. This is the China-backed panel that will chose the first post-colonial leader on Wednesday, with the winner forecast to be conservative-minded shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa. The committee will also be responsible for selecting the provisional legislative body on December 21.\nAn opinion poll published on Monday by the independent daily Ming Pao showed Hong Kong people split over the legitimacy of the provisional legislature.\nThe poll showed 32 percent supporting the body, 30 percent against, and 38 percent voicing no opinion. A sample of 983 respondents were surveyed by telephone for the poll.\nThe Democratic Party, the largest in the Legco with 19 seats, are absent from all China-controlled transition bodies.\nThey have boycotted the selection process, branding the provisional legislature as undemocratic and illegal, and have vowed to challenge its legitimacy in the courts.\nThe threat has forced Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong to consider locating the interim legislature in mainland China in the transitional period.\nBritain has condemned China's plan as reprehensible and unnecessary and has ruled out all cooperation with the body.", "The U.S. food industry, besieged by years of slow growth, wants to whip up new business from people who don't cook.\nArmed with a new study that predicts consumer spending on ready-made foods will accelerate in the next 10 years, food firms are reaching out to a generation that doesn't know the difference between baking powder and baking soda.  \n\"Consumers aren't looking anymore for a cake mix.  They want the slice of cake,\" said John Gray, executive director of the International Foodservice Distributors Association, which helped fund the study released this week.\nIndustry executives this week said they are developing fresh strategies to feed 18-to-24 year olds -- a generation that grew up with working mothers and microwave ovens.\n\"Cooking from scratch is diminishing: many consumers in 2005 will never have cooked a meal from basic ingredients,\" said the study by consulting firm McKinsey & Co Inc titled \"Foodservice 2005: Satisfying America's Changing Appetite.\"  \nThe study confirms trends that food manufacturers and food distributors already are seeing: harried consumers bypass the fresh meat and spice aisles of a supermarket in favor of sections selling barbecued chicken and ready-made salad.\nThe study projects the food industry will grow 1.6 percent per year to nearly $800 billion a year by 2005.  The foodservice sector is expected to capture nearly all of the anticipated incremental sales, pegged at $100 billion.  \n\"There is going to be a whole new plethora of different foodservice opportunities,\" said William Eacho, president and chief executive officer of  Atlantic Food Services, a Virginia-based foodservice distribution company.\nTomorrow's supermarkets are expected to have drive-up windows where consumers can buy ready-made meals.\nExecutives also envision stores that group food by meal categories so that shoppers can head right to the breakfast aisle instead of wandering throughout the store.  \nThe changes are expected to be especially challenging for food manufacturers, who may see shelf space for their products shrink as stores provide more ready-made products.\nNabisco Holdings Corp already is experimenting with ways to ensure its products are not lost in the shuffle.  The maker of items such as Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard wants to leverage its brand popularity into ready-made meals.\n\"As a major food manufacturer, we ought to have our fair share of that growth,\" said Henry Lambert, president of Nabisco's food service company.  \nThat may mean developing a Grey Poupon-based sandwich spread for supermarket sandwiches or working with a dessert manufacturer to sell individual slices of cheesecake that contain Oreo cookies, Lambert said.\nAnd demand for those kinds of products is expected to grow as consumers spend less time preparing meals.  Industry experts estimate people now spend about 20 minutes preparing a meal versus two hours of preparation time about 50 years ago.\n\"The meal is not the social setting of the evening anymore. It's a nuisance,\" said Robert Stauth, chairman and chief executive officer of food distributor Fleming Cos Inc.", "An obscure part of the new telecommunications law could restrict how phone companies use confidential customer data to peddle everything from calling plans and caller I.D. to Internet access and credit cards.\nThe law pits consumer advocates who fear an onslaught of telemarketers and a loss of personal privacy against local, long-distance and cellular carriers wanting to offer their customers one-stop shopping in the new communications age.\nThe data, which include billing records and calling patterns, are taking on added importance as local and long-distance companies, cable-TV operators and others brace to get into each other's business under the new telecom law.\n\"Everybody wants to use these data -- subject to the law -- for their marketing efforts, given that it's a much more competitive environment now,\" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. \"There are new technologies and new markets for the companies.\"\nThe Federal Communications Commission is drafting rules to spell out the limits set by Congress on the use of \"customer proprietary network information.\" CPNI details when calls are made, the destination, the frequency and length, the number and type of phone lines ordered, and the price of the bill.\nFew curbs existed before the new telecom law. The new FCC rules -- which stem from a provision in the law pushed by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., -- are expected in early 1997.\nThe agency must decide what form of customer approval a carrier must receive before using the data for marketing.\nThe rules will determine, for example, what if any okay is needed for a carrier to use a customer's long-distance calling pattern to pitch a cellular service if a customer is seen to make plenty of calls from the road.\nMany phone companies want the FCC to avoid stringent rules requiring detailed customer approval. Industry executives argue that consumers would benefit from flexibile rules that let companies target a customer's communications needs.\n\"It would give us the opportunity to tailor their package of services to what they need and what they want,\" said James Spurlock, AT&T Corp.'s director of federal government affairs.\nBut consumer and privacy groups fear the data could fall into the wrong hands without tough curbs and clear approval.\nThey also fear an explosion in telemarketing: Companies could use CPNI to market a vast array of products and services unrelated to the phone service a customer actually receives.\n\"When consumers sign up for telehone service, they don't expect the information to be used to market non-phone services such as credit cards or investment information,\" said John Windhausen, general counsel for the Competition Policy Institute (CPI), a consumer advocacy group.\nCompanies already use the information. Long-distance carriers pitch cheaper plans based on a customer's calling habits. The marketing is expected to heat up.\nUnder contention at the FCC is whether a company can use the data derived from its long-distance business to pitch local or cellular service, without prior customer assent.\nThe telecom law lets carriers use CPNI without prior approval when supplying the service a customer ordered.\nThe FCC has proposed to classify phone service under three categories: local, long distance and cellular. CPNI from one could not be used to market another without a customer's okay.\nA number of phone companies, including several regional Baby Bell companies, have asked the FCC for just one broad category that would give them greater marketing flexibility.\nTexas phone regulators, by contrast, propose categories based on \"the exact services (the customer) has ordered.\"\nThe FCC also has proposed requiring phone companies to notify customers of their right to restrict access to CPNI.\nUnder contention is whether the notification should be oral or written, such as a notice stuffed into a bill or posted in the \"white pages\" phone directory.\nConsumer advocates, privacy groups and state regulators want advance written approval for use of the information.", "Ominous gray clouds scudded over Hong Kong on Sunday as the British colony marked the 100-day countdown to the handover, but there were few physical signs of gloom and doom in the wealthy community of six million.\nMore than 7,000 Hong Kong people took to the streets to the din of cymbols and kettle drums in a patriotic fervour to celebrate the impending reunion with China at midnight on June 30, 1997.\nA stone's throw away, thousands more, most of them westerners and swelled by an influx of visitors, indulged in the ritualistic orgy that has built up around the annual international Rugby seven-a-side tournament.\nThe tournament was honoured this year, the last under British rule, when Rugby Authorities made it into the world cup event.\nThe 28th and last British governor, Chris Patten, described Hong Kong as running as smoothly as a Rolls Royce limousine -- but warned China against tinkering with the finely tuned machinery that is the Hong Kong of 1997.\nBut for the majority of Hong Kong's hardworking citizenry, it was a normal Sunday. A chance for a lie-in, a family gathering at a restaurant -- a day off from work.\nWith just 100 days to go, Hong Kong is awash in a sea of differing emotions.\nSome, like the street revellers, are delighted that more than 150 years of Chinese humiliation is about to end.\n\"This is a grand and great occasion. In just 100 days, we will return to the Chinese motherland,\" said chief organiser Raymond Wu as the revellers gathered in Victoria Park -- named after the queen who reigned when Britain, at the height of its imperial powers, wrested Hong Kong from China's weak and crumbling Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century.\n\"We welcome the washing away of over a century of humiliation and shame,\" Wu said to a burst of applause.\nOthers fret, particularly the pro-democracy camp, about their future under a China that has already put in place plans to dilute civil liberties and dissolve the elected legislative council -- undoing democratic reforms spearheaded by Patten.\nA handful of demonstrators, their mouths taped shut in what they said was a symbol of things to come, took up position around the base of Queen Victoria's statue and held up placards condemning China's brutal military crackdown on student-led demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.\nMany people are simply keeping their fingers crossed.\nBut Hong Kong, as it enters the last leg of its drawn out transition from British colony to Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, has defied those who forecast a society in chaos, of panic, economic collapse and deserted buildings.\nPatten said Hong Kong had reached this moment in its history in first class condition.\nHe cited a poll conducted earlier this month by the 1997 Transition Project at Hong Kong's Baptist University that found that 90 percent of the people here were happy with life.\nPatten said the views that Hong Kong would quickly adjust to the rolling back of freedoms or of more authoritarian government were dubious.\n\"Hong Kong is, as I said recently, a smoothly functioning community. It's like a Rolls Royce,\" Patten said.\n\"All you need to do if you're in charge is to slip into the driving seat, switch on the ignition and away you go.\n\"I don't quite see the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker with the engine. That only raises worries about whether it will work so well, and whether you may be persuaded by some people to start stripping it down for spare parts.\"", "Riding rising U.S. cable TV fees, Time Warner Inc said its earnings before heavy debt payments shot up 32 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same three months last year.\nCovering the quarter before last Thursday's completion of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System, the entertainment group said three hit movies, strong magazine advertising sales helped by the Olympic Games, and good HBO results lifted cash flow to $964 million.\nRevenues for the three months ended Sept. 30 were $4.877 billion, up from $4.344 billion a year ago.\nLast year's third-quarter cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $729 million, the company said on Wednesday.\nTime Warner, many of whose cable TV and other businesses are co-owned with 25 percent partner U S West Inc., reported a net loss of $167 million, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter.\nNet losses in last year's quarter were $160 million, or 41 cents a share, on 1.5 million more shares outstanding.\nNet interest costs were $276 million, up from $259 million in last year's third quarter. Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.\nTime Warner's stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.\nThe executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.\nOne Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner's cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.\n\"We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure,\" said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.\nThe executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner's $17.5 billion debt halved.\nTime Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.\nCapital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.\nEBITDA at Time Warner's cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.\nBasic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator.\nTime Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- \"Twister,\" \"Eraser\" and \"A Time To Kill\".\nTime Warner shares rose $1.125 to $42 in New York Stock Exchange Trading.", "General Instrument Corp pleased Wall Street Tuesday by announcing a three-way corporate break-up that analysts said will unlock the value of the company's core high-tech communications systems business.\n\"Generally, these things work in the sense that when you do the spinoff, the sum of the parts tends to be greater than the initial whole,\" said industry analyst Hickman Powell at Southeast Research Partners.\nAt the same time, the planned creation of three new companies raises some questions, analysts said.\nChicago-based General Instrument said it will create a company to be called NextLevel Systems Inc out of its cable television, satellite and telephone businesses.\nAlso planned is creation of a new firm called CommScope Inc out of a world-leading coaxial cable manufacturing business, and General Semiconductor Inc out of electronic component manufacturing operations.\n\"Investors will be able to value each of the three companies on its own merits and growth fundamentals,\" said General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland.\nShares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 23 at midday.\nThe prize to emerge from the bust-up will be NextLevel, focused on high-speed modems, television cable set-top boxes and other hot areas. \"That's where the growth is,\" said analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.\nBut some analysts questioned how the business will fund its growth after being stripped of the coaxial and semiconductor businesses, which throw off large cash flows.\n\"The answer must be that that portion will have to, from time to time, come to the equity market,\" Powell said, adding that a recent optic fiber deal with NYNEX Corp bodes well for NextLevel.\nOptic fiber is replacing coaxial cable in many places, especially along communications trunk lines, which may pose a threat to the distant future of CommScope, analysts said.\nBut Powell pointed out, \"There's still quite a lot of the world to be cabled up...That company, by the way, has been gaining market share.\"\nFinally, General Semiconductor on its own will suffer from the same cyclical swings in the electronic components markets that drove it as a unit of General Instrument, analysts said.\n\"Two-thirds of that company are going to be very good stocks. The semi-conductor unit, well, it will come along when the semiconductors recover,\" Ehrenkrantz said.\nGeneral Instrument said the break-up will force it to take charges against earnings of as much as $135 million on its fourth quarter results due February 10 and later this year.", "Large U.S. medical device manufacturers are expected to post strong profit gains for the third quarter, possibly speeding a flight to quality in a sector where small-cap companies are taking a beating.\nFive of nine big device companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings gains of 20 percent or more, according to First Call consensus forecasts.\nOn the strength of actual and projected earnings, stocks in larger companies, such as Medtronic Inc and Boston Scientific Corp, are rallying from a summer slump.  \n\"There hasn't been much of a bounce in the small-cap names. Instead, you're seeing a flight to quality.... Investor sentiment is clearly shifting,\" said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette medical technology analyst Steven Halper.\nAs the market turns cautious on loss-making start-ups, major manufacturers are entering a new period of abundance that makes them attractive, analysts said.\n\"This quarter will suggest that, in fact, the bigger companies are some of the best positioned in the medical technology field. They have a surfeit of new technology and new products,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst Kurt Kruger.  \nProducts are making it to market more quickly as well, thanks to more rapid U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews. The agency approved 37 product marketing applications in its latest fiscal year, up from 27 in the prior year and 26 in fiscal 1994, according to Montgomery Securitities' count.\n\"This has reduced considerably the risk in bringing a new product to market and has important commercial relevance for the industry,\" Kruger said.\nContinued powerful growth in European and Asian consumer demand for U.S. medical devices also bodes well for U.S. companies big enough to take advantage of it, analysts said.  \nU.S. FIRST CALL CONSENSUS QTRLY EARNINGS FORECASTS\nCompany\t\t\t    Qtr  EPS estimate  Yr-ago EPS\nC.R.

Exporters said operations would go ahead in spite of some objections.\nThe new marketing season opened on November 14, delayed from early October.\nCoffee marketing would get underway from mid-December as usual after cocoa harvests tail off, San Pedro exporters said.\n\"Most coffee is now held in village stores and the weather means drying and sorting will take more time,\" said one buyer.\nGood yields meant some farmers had stripped ripe and unripe beans and mixed them together, they said.\nLarge amounts of coffee, both green and ripe red cherries, were this week seen by Reuters drying, some mixed together, along roadsides and in bush clearings, particularly in the north. Green cherries are bought at discounted prices.\nWell-managed plantations visited were harvesting once a month but many trees around villages showed signs of unselective stripping, buyers said.\n\"Farmers take less care when quantities rise so we will have to consider the price,\" said a Daloa buyer. \"Exporters have not put in orders yet so we are not buying.\"\nOne Abidjan-based exporter who went up-country this week also said quality was down. \"It is pretty bad in some places but the quantities are excellent,\" he said.\nOne crop analyst recently forecast 1996/97 production at 230,000 tonnes but most buyers and exporters said the figure was too low. Some up-country buyers said output could even be higher than 250,000 tonnes.\nOne expected 300,000 tonnes this year but most estimates put 1996/97 yields at one-third higher than the previous season, matching expected percentage drops in cocoa output.\nA mild dry season favouring flowering and the natural production cycle of coffee trees had lifted the crop from a relatively poor 180,000 tonnes range in 1995/96, said Jean Toullec, a plantation manager in Gagnoa.\n\"I think 250,000 tonnes is possible as farms are being well maintained,\" he said. \"We are seeing 600 kg of coffee per hectare each harvest instead of 450.\"", "British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group said on Friday it had clinched the CrossCountry passenger rail franchise and planned to spend an extra 250 million pounds ($420 million) on new trains and increased services.\nCrossCountry, which covers more than 100 stations and is based in the central British city of Birmingham, is one of the last few passenger rail franchises to be awarded under Britain's rail priavatisation programme.\nThe company has 842 staff and in the year to March 30 passenger revenues were 108 million pounds.\n\"Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid,\" Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, said in an interview.\nTrain orders will be placed next year, with the first deliveries due to be made in 2002. Under Virgin's financial terms with the government, it will get a subsidy in the first year of the 15 year franchise of 115 million pounds. This is 12 million pounds less than in 1996/97.\nWhitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15 year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 million payment to the government.\nIt will refurbish existing HST 125 diesel trains and has pledged to increase train miles by 14 percent. \"We will grow the service, we will not cut them.\" he said.\nThe services will be rebranded under the Virgin name and cover destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.\nThis is the first rail franchise to be awarded to Virgin Rail which also bid unsuccessfully for the Gatwick Express route which went to National Express buses.\nBut Virgin is on the shortlist for the West Coast rail franchise and has a bid in for the Thameslink service in London. There are 25 rail franchises in all, covering passenger services across Britain.\nSo far the government has sold 14 franchises to the private sector as part of its privatisation of the entire network.\nThe Virgin empire, which spans everything from its airline, music and financial services to its own-label cola, already has a major rail business.\nIt is a partner in the London and Continental Railways consortium which owns the Eurostar passenger service linking London with Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel.\nService through the Channel Tunnel were suspended last week after a serious fire.\nWhitehorn refused to comment on the financial impact of the closure of Eurotunnel's tunnel.", "The UK telecoms market is one of the world's most competitive and any attempt to block a planned $20 billion merger between British Telecom and U.S. firm MCI on grounds of restricted trade will fail, analysts said on Monday.\nThe merger partly hinges on how open the UK market is deemed to be because U.S. rules bar foreign groups from buying more than 25 percent of a U.S. firm unless their home market is deemed to be as competitive as that of the United States.\nIf it is approved, the merger between BT and America's MCI announced on Sunday to create Concert Plc will represent the largest cross-border takeover in history and the world's second biggest international telephone group.\nU.S. telecommunications market leader AT&T, which stands to lose most from such a new heavyweight rival, has urged regulatory authorities to give the planned deal with MCI, the number two U.S. carrier, the \"scrutiny it deserves.\"\nBut analysts said it was unrealistic for AT&T, British Telecom's arch-rival in international markets, to say that the British market was not competitive enough.\nOne industry analyst, asked whether he thought the proposed deal would be cleared, said: \"Ultimately, I think it will be approved. But some tinkering may be required.\"\n\"I don't think it's realistic for AT&T to argue that the market in the UK isn't open -- or that the market in the U.S. is any better,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\nBritain's market is more open than those of its European neighbours, most of which will only abolish state monopolies over telecoms services by January 1, 1998.\nThe European Commission cleared the BT's acquisition of its initial 20 percent stake in MCI three years ago.\nThe merger between BT and MCI to form Concert Plc will have to be approved by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.\nAlthough BT still controls more than 90 percent of all local UK telephone connections, analysts said there were few barriers to foreign companies wanting to compete here.\nAT&T is already planning to establish a foothold in the UK market since the international partnership between BT and Cable and Wireless unit Mercury ended earlier this year.\nAT&T has also been tipped as likely to forge alliances with UK cable companies in the local market as well as with mobile networks and new operators such as Cambridge-based Ionica.\nA spokeswoman for UK telecoms regulator Oftel said it was too early to say which obstacles stood in the way of BT and MCI completing the proposed deal by the end of next year.", "The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks.\nCredit unions praised the court's action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable.\nThe 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions \"was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer,\" said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case.\n\"Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill,\" Schaeffer added.\nAmerican Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that \"the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour.\"\n\"We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear,\" he said.\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year.\nThe case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said.\nThe appeals court ruling in favour of the banks \"threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons,\" Dellinger said.\nUntil 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks.\nBut in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups.\nAs many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups.\nAfter the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions.\nThose limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group.\nCredit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court.\n\"Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition,\" said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. \"If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers' need for credit unions.\"", "Blink and you missed it.\nThe much anticipated correction in Hong Kong stocks on Thursday on news of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping gave fund managers all of 10 minutes to do some much-anticipated bargain hunting.\n\"This was not my expectation,\" said Ambrose Chang, chief investment officer at Daiwa Capital Management in Hong Kong.\nTraders and fund managers said a huge bout of short-covering was responsible for the quick recovery on Thursday.\n\"It was futures driven,\" said one fund manager. \"The hedge funds came in and covered their positions and there were a lot of angry fund managers in London being woken up in the middle of the night by their brokers.\"\nAfter dipping 92 points at the opening, the Hang Seng index surged 305.01 points or 2.33 percent to close at 13,411.33 while the February index future ended 405 points higher at 13,485.\n\"The futures tried to open lower but there was no follow-through selling. All of a sudden they (the hedge funds) knew they were in trouble,\" one head trader said.\nClearly, it was the foreign funds, not the local punters, who got caught out.\n\"This news was in the market the whole week with certain people,\" said the head trader at one local house. \"I knew there was a massive short position in the market and after the first minute of trading, I wasn't at all surprised by what happened.\"\nNow that the dust has settled, fund managers are offering routine explanations for their near-term forecasts for the Hang Seng, all of them variations on the theme of a range-trade between 13,000 and 13,800.\nU.S. interest rates and upcoming corporate earnings are expected to dictate direction, but most market players are expecting consolidation at current levels.\nThere were few reports of so-called \"top-slicing,\" or rotation of funds into other markets, although traders did report profit-taking in Singapore and Indonesia, both of which fell over the course of the week after recent strength.\nSome funds said they had began cutting heavily overweight positions in Hong Kong when the Hang Seng hit 14,000 on January 16 and any further rotation is not justified given this week's strength.\nLast week's action also proved the independence of Asian stocks, which were either unchanged or weaker on domestic factors when the Deng news hit.\n\"They're all completely sucked into their own things,\" one trader said.\nAlthough individual factors helped push many indices lower through the region last week, traders and funds confirmed reports that institutional money was moving out of Asia and into Latin America.\n\"They can't find anything in Asia to buy,\" said one head trader. \"In Singapore and Malaysia, the earnings growth isn't massive and elsewhere it's not great. (Investors) expect better value in Latin America.\"\nOne foreign fund manager said the flows were understandable given that Latin America is trading at about 12 percent earnings growth on a multiple of 11.5 times - 20 percent below the average Asian earnings multiple.\n\"And Southeast Asia is still going through this adjustment,\" he said.\n\"Global asset allocators still look at Asia as a region suffering from cost overruns, squeezed margins and, in some industries, a lack of pricing power.\"", "The Communist Party chief in Tibet has vowed to boost patriotic education in the Himalayan region to battle foreign forces hostile to China and the influence of the exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.\nPatriotic education would be an important factor in battling hostile Western forces that sought to create chaos in Tibet, the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.\n\"Unflaggingly carrying out patriotic education...and opposing the ideologicial infiltration of hostile Western forces and the Dalai Lama clique is an arduous and prominent task,\" the November 12 edition of the newspaper said, quoting party secretary Chen Kuiyuan.\nCombatting the influence of Beijing's chief rival for Tibetan loyalties, the Dalai Lama, was a pressing task for the restive region, Chen said.\nChen accused Western media of spreading the Dalai Lama's plots to split Tibet from China.\n\"The struggle against'westernisation' and'splitting up' is present at every moment and will be present for a long time to come,\" he said.\nBeijing suspects the West is playing the Tibet card to weaken, divide and contain China.\nIdeological education was needed to fight religious thinking and separatist ideas that had penetrated Tibetan schools and threatened to gain control of the region's youth, Chen said.\n\"Teaching cadres, the masses and broad numbers of youth to passionately love the motherland and passionately love socialism is the primary task of ideological construction,\" Chen said.\nChen's speech appeared a day after the newspaper called for tighter controls on religion in Tibet and vowed to crack down on pro-independence monks and nuns.\nThe Dalai Lama, who fled his Himalayan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against communist rule, had draped himself in the cloak of religion to further his splittist aims, Chen said.\nThe Dalai Lama, widely revered in his homeland as a god-king, won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for autonomy for Tibet.\nChen said temples would be the battlefields in the fight against the Dalai Lama. He did not elaborate.\nBeijing has repeatedly cracked down on monks and nuns in the deeply devout Buddhist region and accused the clergy of playing a major role in an underground Tibetan campaign against communist rule.\nTibet has been rocked by anti-Chinese protests by monks and nuns since the 1980s. Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950.\nThe London-based watchdog group Tibet Information Network reported earlier this week that a jailed Tibetan nun had had her sentence doubled to 18 years for defying Beijing's choice of the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk.\nThe party boss also warned that superstitious beliefs had made a recent comeback in the region because the Dalai Lama had used religion to drug the people.\nUgly religious practices had appeared again in wedding and funeral ceremonies and other aspects of social life, Chen said.\nReligion had even taken root among some government officials and threatened to hinder the economic development of the backward and remote region, Chen said.\n\"These negative ideas and actions block the spread of science and technology and hinder the development of productive forces,\" he said.", "Czech Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier and leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition, quit the government and parliament on Tuesday for falsely using an academic title, the CTK news agency said.\nKalvoda, aged 43, resigned for falsely claiming he was a doctor of law amid a growing row over the academic credentials of Czech politicians after deputies began questioning whether they were all genuine.\n\"Yes, (Kalvoda resigned) and he delivered his resignation to the president,\" Mariana Cerna of the parliament's press office told Reuters.\nAnother member of parliament from a party in the centre-right ruling coalition also quit the house for the same reason, while three other deputies admitted using false titles but did not step down, the news agency reported.\nOfficials of Kalvoda's party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were not immediately available for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.\nPrime Minister Vaclav Klaus, head of the senior Civic Democratic Party, said he would meet on Wednesday morning with Christian Democrat chairman Josef Lux and a designated member of Kalvoda's party to assess the situation in the three-party coalition.\n\"It's a political swerve, it's disquieting and unsettling, and the aim of all of us is that it would happen without any teetering,\" Klaus told reporters after Kalvoda's resignation.\nODA's press department said it would not comment until a meeting of its party leaders on Wednesday.\nKalvoda, who headed the most pro-business party in the coalition, often bumped heads with Klaus on issues such as speeding up the deregulation of heating prices and rents and lowering taxes.\nPavla Jurkova, a member of the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), resigned her seat in the 200-seat lower house -- where the centre-right coalition has 99 seats -- for falsely claiming a law doctorate, CTK said.\nTwo members of Klaus's party also admitted that their law doctorates, used in campaign material earlier this year, were false, CTK said, but Anna Roeschova and Ondrej Zemina had not resigned their seats.\nAlso staying put in parliament was a member of the opposition Social Democrats, Marie Noveska, after admitting she had not finished university but still used the title doctor of law.", "Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. so far have convinced the courts that their $8.6 billion merger plan should proceed, but they still need to win over unhappy shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp.'s higher bid.\nLawyers and financial advisors were expected in the next few days to consider several plans aimed at persuading investors to approve a crucial measure needed for the deal.\nMeanwhile, CSX said Thursday that its $110 cash tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, which represents the first part of its plan to buy Conrail, was oversubscribed.\nThe proposed stock and cash transaction has angered many investors, who prefer an all-cash $10 billion offer by Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va.\nPhiladelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer of $110 a share, saying the union with CSX provides more strategic benefits.\nSources close to the companies said no final decision has been made about how to woo Conrail shareholders, but options include sweetening the stock portion of the deal or setting a \"collar\" to guard against price volatility.\nThey will also consider revising the deal's terms to accelerate payment to investors, according to the sources, who did not want to be identified.\nThe two companies could also decide to keep the terms unchanged, betting that shareholders will ultimately choose the CSX offer over Norfolk Southern's offer, which cannot be formally considered by Conrail until July.\n\"There's only one thing they can do and that's to sweeten the offer. I don't know how they're going to get enough votes if they don't,\" said Thom Brown, managing director at investment firm Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood Inc., which holds some 50,000 shares of Conrail.\nRichmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail declined to comment on their plans, but acknowledged last week they were discussing increasing the value of the pact upon its consummation.\nSources close to the companies said there is no rush to make a decision, noting that Conrail can easily postpone the shareholder vote that is now slated for mid-December.\nCSX and Conrail won a significant victory this week when a U.S. district court judge denied a request by Norfolk Southern to block the CSX-Conrail deal. An appeals panel also declined to block the first step of the deal.\nNorfolk Southern, meanwhile, withdrew its motion for an expedited appeal of the federal court ruling that allowed CSX to buy the 19.9 percent stake in Conrail, since the tender offer expired at midnight on Wednesday.\nBut a group of Conrail shareholders pursuing a lawsuit and appeal similar to Norfolk Southern's did not withdraw their motion for expedited appeal. The group urged the court on Wednesday to hear an expedited appeal and \"sterlize\" the 19.9 percent Conrail stake by preventing CSX from voting it at a shareholders meeting needed for the merger to occur.\nBecause Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer, shareholders will be asked in mid-December to approve a measure that would permit CSX to buy 40 percent.\nThe CSX-Conrail transaction calls for CSX to buy 40 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share in cash and exchange the remaining 60 percent for CSX stock.\nSources close to the company said Conrail and CSX were well aware of the potential difficulties in winning the necessary votes.\nIndustry experts believe shareholders may be more willing to approve the 40 percent measure if they were guaranteed more favourable terms for the stock portion of the deal.\n\"They can't get the vote until they improve the back-end of the deal and they know that,\" one takeover specialist said.\nMeanwhile, Conrail stock tumbled, reflecting the expiration of CSX's tender offer. The stock fell $2.25 to $94.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBased on Thursday's stock price, the Conrail-CSX transaction values shares of Conrail at about $95.10 each. The stock portion of the deal would be exchanged at a value of about $85.15 for each Conrail share.", "Wheat is unlikely to become a casualty of the row between Beijing and Washington over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since higher grain production in China is slashing the need for imports, traders said on Tuesday.\n\"As far as we see business, we could well not have anything with China for the rest of this year,\" a U.S. trader said.\n\"The (Chinese) domestic crop looks good, they have cancelled a lot of orders already. Canada has enough to hold China if they do need to get into the market,\" she said.\nChina's 1996/97 wheat production is expected to hit a record 107 million tonnes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said earlier this month, raising its estimate from 104 million tonnes.\nAs a result, total imports were also revised downward by one million tonnes to eight million tonnes.\nA new war of words broke out between Beijing and Washington this month after the Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy missiles and other weaponry worth around US$420 million.\nBeijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.\nChina has demanded the United States cancel plans for these latest arms sales to prevent \"new damage\" to bilateral ties.\nSino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.\nTies had been slowly recovering after reaching a nadir in June 1995 with a U.S. visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui.\nChina had cancelled around 1.4 million tonnes of wheat orders from the United States since early June, the USDA said.\nWhile some trading sources have speculated that the cancellations could be in retaliation for stalled bilateral negotiations over a fungus called tilletia controversa kuhn, or TCK smut, others put them down to the good Chinese crop outlook.\nChina is expected, however, to maintain its traditonal level of wheat imports from Canada of around five million tonnes a year. Canadian trade sources have said China's buying programme has already begun.\nNone of this has deterred U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman from his optimism that China will remain a committed buyer of U.S. wheat.\n\"I think the key issue myself with China is supplies in China,\" Glickman said in Chicago on Monday.\nChina imported 11.59 million tonnes of wheat in 1995, up 58.7 percent from the 7.3 million tonnes the year before.", "Motorola Inc is appealing to Chinese authorities over taxes on capital imports that would boost the cost of a $500 million semiconductor plant being built in the city of Tianjin, a company official said on Friday.\nConstruction of the plant in Xiqing district, a half an hour's drive from the northern port city's centre, was on schedule and production was expected to begin in the first quarter of 1998, said the official, who declined to be identified.\nThe U.S. high-technology giant was appealing to China's State Council, or cabinet, over taxes on imports of vital equipment for the semiconductor plant, or fab, he said.\nBeijing on April 1 abolished privileges for foreign-funded ventures that had allowed them to import machinery and other capital equipment free of tax. Investors say the move has dramatically increased the cost of many projects.\n\"There is an appeal committee within the State Council and we are appealing for some tax exemption (for the Xiqing plant),\" the Motorola official said.\nHe declined to say if the company was optimistic of being granted exemptions, or when a decision was expected.  \nAn official of the State Council's information office contacted by telephone said he was unaware of an appeal by Motorola over taxes on imports, adding that such matters were the concern of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nWork on the Xiqing project had already begun, the Motorola official said.\n\"We have already broken ground...Now we are erecting the buildings,\" he said. \"We are looking at 1998, first quarter (to begin production).\"\nInitial investment in the venture was expected to be around $500 million, but the cost of such semiconductor plants could easily rise to $1.0 billion, he said but gave no details.\nMotorola has been quoted as saying the Xiqing plant will produce 180,000 eight-inch sub-micron wafers a year, making it a major addition to a Chinese semiconductor industry that has long lagged far behind its Asian neighbours.\nMotorola, which has vowed to invest $1.2 billion in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong between 1988 and 2000, generated sales revenues in China and Hong Kong of $3.2 billion last year, the official said.  \nThe company's China plants were considered strategic investments, he said, adding that the local content rate of their products was expected to rise to around 55 percent by 2000 from around 45 percent currently.\nMotorola's exports from its China operations accounted for about 30 percent of production value, less than expected because of the breakneck expansion of the domestic market, he said.\n\"The market here, especially the telecom market, just exploded,\" he said.\nState media has quoted Motorola executives as saying the number of Chinese using pagers is likely to rise by around 43 percent this year to more than 40 million people, making China the biggest user of pagers in the world.\nMotorola currently supplies more than 50 percent of the domestic pager market, the official said, but declined to give details.", "A U.S. military honour guard on Friday formally took back the remains of U.S. airmen killed in World War Two and sent them on their final journey home.\nChinese officials handed over to U.S. Ambassador James Sasser three black cases containing the remains of the B-24 bomber's crew, who died when their plane hit a steep mountain slope in China's southwestern Guangxi region 52 years ago.\nUnder a crisp blue winter sky, uniformed men and women from the U.S. Army, Marine Corps and Navy placed the remains in three body-length aluminium cases and covered each with an American flag in a ceremony at Beijing's Capital Airport.\n\"This ceremony is dedicated to the American servicemen who made contributions and sacrificed their lives to resist fascist aggression,\" said Mei Ping, director of the North American and Oceanian Affairs Office of China's Foreign Ministry.\n\"The remains of these airmen will now be repatriated to their homeland where they can finally rest in peace,\" Mei said at the ceremony.\nThe oblong cases were loaded onto a U.S. C-141 Starlifter transport aircraft that was to fly the remains to the Department of Defence's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for identification.\nThe remains represented more than one person but it was still unknown how many individuals they belonged to, said Alan Liotta of the MIA/POW (Missing in Action/Prisoner of War) Office under the Department of Defence.\nChinese and U.S. officials and soldiers saluted the dead airmen as a military dirge drifted across the airport tarmac.\nU.S. officials said the mission to recover the remains was part of an ongoing effort by the U.S. and Chinese governments to provide a full accounting of American soldiers lost in regional conflicts.\n\"After 50 years, we have every reason, between the United States and China, to live in peace and work for peace, security and prosperity of mankind,\" Mei told reporters.\nU.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\nJiang revealed the find at a time when both Washington and Beijing say ties are improving after plunging early last year.\nTwo local farmers discovered the wreckage of the aircraft last October after becoming lost while looking for wild herbs.\nThe B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned to its base in Guangxi after completing a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan on August 31, 1944.\nA six-man forensic team from the Department of Defence that clawed its way up the steep, slippery face of Mao'er mountain on Tuesday to inspect the crash site found more human remains and parts of the bomber.\nU.S. officials said they had made contact with all 10 families of the crewmen aboard the plane. They said the site appeared to have been untouched for more than half a century.", "China's decision to ban imports of some U.S. chicken meat due to concerns about a fowl plague could hit a multi-million dollar export business, although U.S. officials said Friday American chickens do not have the disease.\n\"We don't have highly pathogenic avian influenza (A.I.) in the U.S.,\" a U.S. quarantine official told Reuters. \"There is no record of it being found in domestic poultry,\" he said, adding that the disease had been eradicated after an outbreak in the 1980s.\n\"It affects the birds but not the meat. The meat does not transmit anything to people,\" the official said.\nWashington's agriculture attache in Beijing notified his head office on Thursday that China had blocked imports of chicken meat from 10 U.S. states because of concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza.\nU.S. sources in Beijing said China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine, or CAPQ, had confirmed the ban by telephone on Friday and was preparing notification, which was expected some time next week.\n\"We initially heard about a ban on the import of poultry chicks, but no one at CAPQ has been able to confirm or deny that,\" a senior diplomatic source said.\n\"Now, if poultry chicks aren't banned for reasons of A.I., why is poultry meat banned? It makes no sense,\" he said.\nAsked to confirm reports of the block on chicken imports, a quarantine official in Beijing told Reuters by telephone: \"It is true.\" He declined to give details.\nHowever, Customs officials said they were unaware of the ban.\nU.S. officials in Beijing said any ban China might place on U.S. chicken meat imports because of avian influenza was not based on sound scientific evidence. \"It comes down to good science versus bad science,\" one senior official said.\nThe ban could have a major impact on U.S. poultry exports to China. In 1995, 330,000 metric tons worth $445 million was trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council. China is the second-largest market for U.S. poultry products after Russia, the council's Hong Kong director, Sarah Li, said.\n\"It is the only market to take paws,\" she said, referring to chicken feet. \"People say U.S. chickens need wheelchairs because all their feet are going to China.\"\nThe Chinese chicken ban is the latest headache for U.S. agriculture officials in China. Wheat is a continuing issue, with China refusing to import grain from the Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of a fungus called TCK smut.\nWashington claims the fungus is harmless, that the ban is not based on good science, that it cuts annual U.S. wheat sales to China by 500,000 tons and is a non-tariff trade barrier. China, on the other hand, says TCK smut could cut domestic wheat yields if it got into the domestic growing areas.", "An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company's tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.\nOdwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.\nState and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.\nAt least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state's deputy health secretary, said.\n\"It's difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don't think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases,\" Fields told Reuters.\nThe outbreak was the state's worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.\nWhile adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.\nIn the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.\nThe strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or   fertilizer\nthat includes steer manure.\nHealth officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.\n\"Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,\" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.\nAlthough so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.\nOdwalla, which bills itself as the \"leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,\" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.\nIn the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million. But net income fell to $633,000, or 12 cents a share, from $997,000, or 22 cents a share.", "LucasVarity Plc, the U.S.-Anglo auto components giant formed in September, announced a major restructuring Tuesday, including the planned disposal of 13 non-core businesses and the elimination of 3,000 jobs over two years.\nLucasVarity said it had identified a range of additional moves that will mean an extra 120 million British pounds ($200 million) in profit benefits -- double the level anticipated just three months ago when the company was formed in the merger of Lucas Industries of Britain and Varity Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.\nWorldwide employment will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said.\nLucasVarity said it also will take an extra one-time charge of 130 million pounds ($217 million), mainly in non-cash items, along with 120 million pounds ($200 million) in charges already planned for this year.\nThirteen companies were identified for sale in a three-month post-merger review, although only eight were named in the restructuring announcement -- all small businesses in Britain, Argentina and South Africa.\nChief Executive Victor Rice said in an interview that the company was \"sifting through some offers\" and expected to be in \"active negotiations\" on the sale of some of the 13 units quite soon.\nRice said major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.\nThe criteria for divestment were those firms which \"neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value,\" Rice said.\nRice, who came from Varity, said the post-divestment savings were \"virtually double\" original expectations.\nLucasVarity is involved in the design, manufacture and supply of systems, products and services in international automotive, diesel engine, aftermarket and aerospace industries.\nBoth parties in the merger specialised in braking systems and industry sources expected that many of the measures would affect production and employment in these units.", "Colombia will announce cuts in coffee exports next week under the terms of a beefed up retention plan recently agreed by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), coffee czar Jorge Cardenas said on Thursday.\nThe head of the National Coffee Growers' Federation also said Colombia's internal coffee price would be raised in view of recent gains in international markets. He did not, however, say when the hike would take effect nor what the percentage rise would be.\nIn the provinces, meanwhile, coffee growers are becoming increasingly worried about potential crop damage caused by recent torrential downpours, which meteorologists say have pushed rainfall levels up to 160 percent higher than the seasonal average. Weather forecasters say the outlook for February is just as bad.\nUnder terms of the ACPC deal hammered out in Rio de Janeiro on Jan. 23, member nations will slash back total exports by 1.3 million bags in the first half of 1997 from the original target of 26.28 million bags set in May.\nOne million bags of that will be robusta but arabica- producing countries, like Colombia, agreed to rein back 300,000 bags of exports in solidarity. Cardenas declined to specify what proportion of the cut would correspond to Colombia.\n\"The cuts will respond to production conditions and the export situation in each individual country. We will be announcing the cuts this will imply for Colombia next week,\" Cardenas told Reuters.\nAs speculation grew this week that the federation would announce the rise in internal coffee prices at its first meeting of the year Friday, Jan. 31, private exporters complained of short supplies.\n\"Intermediaries and producers have increased prices to scandalous levels in anticipation of a rise in the internal coffee price. Some are just holding on and won't even sell. In some cases prices are up by as much as 10 percent,\" said Alvaro Ramirez of Cargill exporters.\n\"In view of the situation in external markets, we will of course have to raise the internal price of coffee,\" Cardenas said. \"We will do the projections and take the decision on the basis of that,\" he said.\nThe federation cut internal coffee prices by 14,000 pesos per 125-kg load to 221,500 after a turbulent coffee growers' congress on Dec. 5. The move aimed to reduce the deficit of the Coffee Fund, an organization administered by the federation which buys all Colombian coffee at a pre-agreed support price.\nThe cut was achieved by withdrawing a 14,000 peso premium, paid in the form of a bond instead of cash, which had been introduced to compensate for the poor outlook for coffee in the 1996 calendar year.\nThe good news on the internal price front, however, is taking a back seat to the recent weather problems.\n\"In the southwest and Andean regions, and particularly the coffee growing region, rainfall has been as much as 160 percent higher than normal,\" said Leonardo Rivera, meteorologist at the national weather center IDEAM.\n\"These conditions will be prolonged and we're likely to see similar levels of rainfall through February,\" he added.\nJanuary and February are normally dry months in Colombia. But the torrential rains this year have been caused by a cooling in the surface temperature of the Pacific ocean, known as the La Nina effect -- conditions not seen for at least the last 10 years.\nCoffee growers say the rains are delaying the flowering period and fear the main harvest, which normally begins in October, could either be very late or that a part could be lost entirely.\nCardenas said it was too early to predict what the impact of the weather could be on crop levels but said federation technicians were drawing up a detailed report, which they hoped to issue in mid-February.", "Zero tax and limited regulation are luring billions of dollars into offshore mutual funds, spurring a growth industry in famed tax-free locations such as the Cayman Islands, according to a mutual fund legal expert.\n\"I think every indication is that the offshore part of the mutual fund industry will grow. In the offshore jurisdiction you have no taxation and a more appropriate level of regulation as a rule of thumb,\" said Anthony Travers, senior partner at Maples and Calder in Hong Kong.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests these advantages have drawn nearly US$900 billion into offshore mutual funds so far out of an entire industry sometimes valued at US$5 trillion, he said.\nA lack of professional infrastructure is often a compelling disincentive to authorising funds in countries offering the greatest returns, while high taxation levels deter mutual funds from setting up in promising developed markets, he said on Friday.\nThe alternative is to authorise the fund in an offshore region, avoiding tax while reaching into some of the world's most rewarding investment regions.\nThere are, however, drawbacks.\n\"If you go offshore and you invest into the onshore jurisdiction from your mutual funds, you have things like withholding tax and tax treatments that may be imposed on your profits, and marketing is very much an issue,\" Travers said.\nCertain double tax treaty networks can allow investors to avoid some onshore tax requirements, but these treaties vary from country to country, as do marketing restrictions, he said. For example, offshore mutual funds are prevented from marketing to more than 100 investors in the United States, while the United Kingdom prohibits marketing of offshore retail mutual funds unless they are based in designated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey.\nIt is possible to market a Cayman Islands-registered mutual fund in the United Kingdom, but only as a private placement and not as a retail fund, Travers said.\nDespite their obvious benefits, Travers warned that investing in offshore mutual funds is not for everyone.\nThe lack of regulation gives greater flexibility in the establishment and administration of mutual funds but it also provides little recourse for unsophisticated retail investors, which partly explains why these funds cannot be marketed freely in the United States or the United Kingdom.\n\"You are essentially talking about mutual funds which are established by institutions for other institutions or very high net worth and sophisticated individuals, in which case it is felt additional layers of regulation are not appropriate or necessary,\" he said.\nIt is possible to market offshore retail funds in Europe, but funds must meet the requirements of the \"Undertakings of Collective Investment and Transfer of Securities\" (UCITS) directive, which ensures certain standards are met.\n\"They are supposed to be able to sell UCITS cross-border in Europe but in fact the European Union is still something of a myth when it comes to cross-border marketing,\" Travers said.\n\"And you find in these jurisdictions commensurately higher fees. Three to six basis points on net asset value is the price you pay to market to the retail sector,\" he said.", "Debt-laden Eurotunnel faced fresh financial pressure on Wednesday in the wake of the fire which swept through a main tunnel leaving a trail of damage, no running services and shaken consumer confidence.\nJust one month after coming back from the brink of bankruptcy with a restructuring of nine billion pounds ($15 billion) of debt, the company faced uncertainy once again as one of its two rail tunnels remained shut pending a safety review.\nAnalysts said the modest fall in Eurotunnel shares since Monday's fire was about right, however, and few believed there would be long-term damage to customer confidence.\nEurotunnel has warned of reduced services for weeks ahead as repair work goes ahead and eats into revenues.\nAnd one source close to Eurotunnel told Reuters that the cost of repairs may be heavier than first thought. \"The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, it you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage.\"\nHe added that track sections may also need replacing after buckling in the intense heat.\nWhile the tunnel remains shut, Eurotunnel is losing revenues at the rate of one million pounds a day. It also faces the cost of compensating passengers and tranferring them by air or ferry.\nA Eurotunnel spokesman said all these costs should be covered by insurance, however.\n\"It will have very little impact,\" said one analyst. \"Transport disasters are always newsworthy but the bad publicity will soon fade away. Eurotunnel will be financially damaged, but you have to look at it in relation to the nine billion of debt.\"\nThe ferries have been scooping up extra business from big freight customers like TNT, which said it would be using the ferries more as a result of the tunnel fire.\nAndrew Darke, analyst at Williams de Broe, said \"There's clearly going to be some emotional reaction, but I expect it to be short-lived. After all passenger numbers rose after the Herald of Free Enterprise (ferry) disaster nine years ago.\n\"Disasters don't stop people travelling. People still go shopping in London despite IRA bombs,\" he said.\nEurotunnel had around 45 percent of the cross-Channel ferry market before the fire -- a share won partly by waging a cut-throat price-war with the ferries, which have since proposed linking up to battle against their tunnel rival.\nSwedish ferry giant Stena Line and P&O agreed to merge in October and are awaiting clearance from competition bodies.\nDarke said P&O's chances of clearance had been boosted by the tunnel disaster. The verdict is due later this month.", "The UK telecoms market is one of the world's most competitive and any attempt to block a planned $20 billion merger between British Telecom and U.S. firm MCI on grounds of restricted trade will fail, analysts said.\nThe merger partly hinges on how open the UK market is deemed to be because U.S. rules bar foreign groups from buying more than 25 percent of a U.S. firm unless their home market is deemed to be as competitive as that of the United States.\nIf it is approved, the merger between BT and America's MCI announced on Sunday to create Concert Plc will represent the largest cross-border takeover in history and the world's second biggest international telephone group.\nU.S. telecommunications market leader AT&T, which stands to lose most from such a new heavyweight rival, has urged regulatory authorities to give the planned deal with MCI, the number two U.S. carrier, the \"scrutiny it deserves.\"\nBut analysts said it was unrealistic for AT&T, British Telecom's arch-rival in international markets, to say that the British market was not competitive enough.\nOne industry analyst, asked whether he thought the proposed deal would be cleared, said: \"Ultimately, I think it will be approved. But some tinkering may be required.\"\n\"I don't think it's realistic for AT&T to argue that the market in the UK isn't open -- or that the market in the U.S. is any better,\" said one analyst who declined to be named.\nBritain's market is more open than those of its European neighbours, most of which will only abolish state monopolies over telecoms services by January 1, 1998.\nThe European Commission cleared the BT's acquisition of its initial 20 percent stake in MCI three years ago.\nThe merger between BT and MCI to form Concert Plc will have to be approved by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.\nAlthough BT still controls more than 90 percent of all local UK telephone connections, analysts said there were few barriers to foreign companies wanting to compete here.\nAT&T is already planning to establish a foothold in the UK market since the international partnership between BT and Cable and Wireless unit Mercury ended earlier this year.\nAT&T has also been tipped as likely to forge alliances with UK cable companies in the local market as well as with mobile networks and new operators such as Cambridge-based Ionica.\nA spokeswoman for UK telecoms regulator Oftel said it was too early to say which obstacles stood in the way of BT and MCI completing the proposed deal by the end of next year.", "Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals stood at around 390,000-410,000 tonnes by mid-December, after a slow start to the month, analysts and exporters say.\nExporters blamed a combination of crop profile and demand factors for the dip in December -- usually the strongest month.\nThe figures to December 16 were down from an estimated 540,000 tonnes by that date last year, but some analysts said a further 50,000 tonnes should be added to this year's total for comparative purposes as the season had opened three weeks late.\nAn averaged figure plus the 50,000 tonnes would put arrivals since October 1 at 450,000. Various sources put arrivals at San Pedro since October 1 at 130,000-140,000 tonnes with the rest going to the main port of Abidjan.\n\"Arrivals were slower than usual for December but in the past week arrivals have overtaken last year's (weekly) rate,\" said one exporter. \"People are completing December contracts but January will be strong,\" he added.\nSubsequent arrivals up to December 22 were said by exporters to be around 50,000 tonnes per week. They expected the deficit in arrivals compared to last year to grow in December before narrowing sharply in January, when arrivals pick up again.\nDifficulty in obtaining export contracts from the Caistab marketing board and problems with bean drying after rains upcountry had accentuated the usual Christmas period drop-off.\nRains had damaged bushtracks, delaying collection and raising humidity and moisture to above acceptable levels in some areas.\n\"We are refusing some cocoa. There is a lot more coming down now the sun is out,\" said one Abidjan-based exporter.\nDrying problems and poor fermentation had raised bean humidity to 11 percent in some areas, extending both normal and machine drying times.\n\"Humidity levels are slipping back down from anything up to 11 percent,\" said one San Pedro-based buyer, and the guideline farmgate price of 315 CFA per kilo had on the whole been paid to growers.\nUpcountry buyers visited by Reuters over Christmas had taken the chance to dry out large quantities of fresh through to greyish moist beans as a wet early December gave way to usual dry sunny weather ahead of the holiday.\n\"It's patchy, but sunny days are here again,\" said one buyer. \"Whatever was cut off in village stores or too wet can now be properly dried out,\" he added.\nSan Pedro received over 15,000 in the week from December 16, exporters there said.\nReports of smuggling to Guinea continue to surface but one Western diplomat recently returning by road from Conakry said road conditions were appalling and few covered trucks had been seen.\nLarge shipments in the past weeks are expected to cut into port stocks.\n\"Port area stocks are unclear but there are a lot of bulk shipments,\" said one exporter.", "John McGrath, chief executive of food and drinks giant Grand Metropolitan Plc said the company will continue to unshackle itself from production in its mission to bear down on costs.\n\"In many cases we don't need to produce what we sell,\" McGrath told Reuters. \"Whether you own the processing is often academic as long as you control the quality.\"\nThe company is looking at further Seneca-type deals in the next year, he said, where a third party takes on the production but GrandMet keeps hold of pricing, marketing and quality.  \nLast year, GrandMet contracted out to U.S. company Seneca the processing and packaging of its Green Giant's canned vegetables. Green Giant was acquired as part of Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. food arm, in 1989.\nPillsbury currently produces some 75 percent of what it sells and this number will decline in the future.\nIf a product can be insulated by patent from the competition, then GrandMet would want to continue making it, said McGrath in an interview. But, if it's a bread or biscuit product, for instance, it may make economic sense to allow a third party producer in.  \n\"We would never get out of distilling whisky or blending.... that is a skill which only a few highly skilled people can ensure. They know how to get the right quality, the right taste, the right balance. But, whether you need to bottle it yourself is another matte,\" McGrath said.\n\"The best example is Coca-Cola who are brand marketeers, brand owner and controllers of the concentrate. But, whether they own the processing is academic as long as they control the quality.\"  \nMcGrath paid tribute to former chairman Lord Sheppard, who stood down as chairman in March, after 21 years with the group, for transforming GrandMet into a leaner, more focused company.\nWhen Sheppard took over in 1987, he found a company with over 30 very different business which he thinned down to three: food, drinks and Burger King retailing.\nMcGrath, appointed chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), GrandMet's spirits arm, in September 1993, brought a tough, cost-conscious urge to make Sheppard's vision work.  \nMcGrath, whose management skills stem from the shopfloor and operations rather than boardroom, separates himself from the culture of GrandMet's heady, deal-making days of the last decade when companies were carved up and sold on in droves.\n\"The view I take which the board strongly supports is concentrating on making those very expensive assets that we have acquired work highly efficiently.\"\n\"Now is the time to concentrate on organic growth very strongly supported by new brand development. We will only make minor acquisitions chiefly in emerging markets or food service in the U.S. where we can get some good returns,\" he said.\n\"What I am very much concentrating on now is taking all the action we possibly can to as rapidly as possible increase our return on capital,\" said McGrath.\n\"We are investing for the medium term and no longer for short term gain,\" he said.", "Canada's Big Six banks are cruising toward a record C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) annual profit with strong earnings from three banks and buoyant profits expected from Canada's two other largest banks next week.\nBank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia -- the number three and four banks respectively -- cracked the C$1 billion ($740 million) mark this week.\nToronto-Dominion Bank fell short of the billion dollar club, but Canada's fifth largest bank still turned in a record year.\nThe profit parade continues when Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce deliver their results on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.\n\"They will have whopping earnings. They will be record earnings, rest assured,\" Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with TD Sercurities Inc., said on Friday.\nNational Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, also reports its earnings next Thursday.\nBank of Montreal, Scotiabank and TD posted double-digit increases in net income this week -- with strong growth in personal, corporate and investment banking. The earnings so far have been in line with analysts' forecasts.\n\"There were no surprises. Just really solid quarters from everybody,\" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell.\nThe banks' investment, brokerage and mutual fund businesses enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.\nRoyal Bank's investment arm. RBC Dominion Securities Ltd, has already posted a record profit. RBC said on Thursday its earnings jumped to C$154.3 million ($114 million) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, up from C$77 million ($57 million) a year ago.\n\"In addition to two major mergers...each of our four global businesses turned in strong performances contributing to record results for the year,\" said RBC president Reay Mackay.\nRBC recently completed its C$480 million ($355 million) purchase of brokerage firm Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., and merged some operations with parent Royal Bank.\nCIBC's investment unit is also expected to post bullish earnings when the bank reports its results next week.\nAnalysts said earnings growth for the Big Six is expected slow in 1997, particularly if bond and stock markets cool off.\nHowever, TD Bank expects the boom to continue. \"The current low level of interest rates should result in increased economic activity in Canada in 1997 and the gradual return of consumer confidence,\" said TD president Charles Baillie.\nMore dividend hikes are possible next week following increases at Scotiabank and TD.\nScotiabank raised its payout by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share, its second increase of 1996. TD boosted its dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C28 cents (21 cents) a share.\n\"I would be astonished if CIBC did not increase its dividend at this time,\" said Palmer. CIBC last raised its dividend by C5 cents (4 cents) to C45 cents (33 cents) last June.\nMaxwell said there is less pressure on Royal Bank and National Bank to raise their dividends now, but an increase may come in early 1997.\nImproved credit quality also contributed to bottom lines of Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal and TD.\nAll three banks reported lower loan loss provisions for 1996. TD surprising analysts with a deeper-than-expected drop in its provision to C$152 million ($112 million) from C$180 million ($133 million) in 1995.\nAnalysts said loan losses for the Big Six appear to have touched bottom and are expected to creep higher next year.", "China is poised to take a major step in reversing democratic reform in Hong Kong by creating a new legislature to replace the territory's elected body when Beijing resumes control of the British colony next year.\nThe die will be cast on Saturday when 400 Hong Kong people, carefully screened by China, meet over the border in the city of Shenzhen to appoint 60 legislators who will make Hong Kong's laws from July 1.\nThe \"provisional legislature\" will be installed after China disbands the elected Legislative Council (Legco) in a move to roll back political reforms introduced by Beijing's nemesis, departing colonial governor Chris Patten, since 1992.\nThe body that will choose the new parliamentarians is the Selection Committee, which also elected Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping tycoon with strong pro-Beijing loyalties, to succeed Patten as chief executive of the territory of 6.3 million people.\nChina resumes control of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 next year, ending more than 150 years of British rule.\nThe Hong Kong public, who voted resoundingly for pro-democracy groups in Legco elections last year, have had no vote in the two selection processes organised by China and no say in the decision to remove the elected legislature.\nThe Sino-British quarrel over the provisional legislature set Tung and Patten on a collision course this week.\n\"A quarter of those who are lining up for jobs in this institution were beaten in regular elections.... It will be a blot on the first months of Chinese rule,\" Patten told a newspaper. \"This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong.... We will have nothing to do with it any form.\"\nTung responded in a speech to the business community by saying Britain must \"face the reality\" of the new legislature. He warned that if its legitimacy was challenged further he would get China's parliament to legislate on its legality.\nHong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting the selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.\n\"You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,\" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.\nThe Democratic Party has expelled a rebel member, Dominic Chan, because he broke ranks to run for the new assembly.\nThe party is organising two days of protests against the provisional legislature, and China has beefed up security on the border in case demonstrators try to cross into Shenzhen, local media quoted Chinese sources as saying.\nThe Selection Committee will choose the 60 members of the provisional legislature from a list of 130 candidates.\nPro-Beijing parties fielding candidates denied critics' allegations this week that they had negotiated the result of the voting in advance in under-the-table horse-trading.\n\"There is definitely no carve-up of seats,\" said Liberal Party leader Allen Lee.\nEach Selection Commitee member will vote by endorsing up to 60 names from among the candidates. The top 60 candidates -- those listed the most times -- will be appointed to the provisional legislature.\nAmong the candidates are 34 incumbent legislators, raising the prospect that Legco could be crippled well before Chinese rule, because the two legislatures' schedules could clash.\nA poll by Hong Kong University indicated on Thursday that one-third of the public support the concept of the new legislature and one-quarter trust the Chinese government.", "Scotch whisky maker Highland Distilleries posted a 14 percent fall in its full year profits on Monday, saying sales of its brand leader The Famous Grouse blend fell in Britain and the home market remained tough.\n\"The UK continues to be a very competitive market. However there are indications that prices are moving up with more emphasis being given to brand building activities,\" it said.\nPretax profits fell to 37.1 million pounds ($58.43 million) in the year ended August 31, 1996 down 14 percent. Before reorganisation costs, profits were flat at 36.5 million pounds, below the market forecast range of 39.2 million to 42.5 million. Highland's shares fell 10p to 332p in early trade.\nThe British market for Scotch whisky fell by four percent, despite a cut in excise duty in the November 1995 Budget, while sales of The Famous Grouse fell by three percent.\n\"These results illustrate the problem Highland has got; the fact it still makes about 60 percent of its profits out of Famous Grouse sales in the UK where the market continues to be very competitive,\" said BZW analyst Charles Winston.\nIn the England and Wales off trade, which represents 65 percent of the home market, the Famous Grouse market share rose 0.5 percent to 9.3 percent.\nHowever, sales in the on-trade or in pubs and restaurants remained tough and The Famous Grouse share fell by one percentage point. But overall market share for The Famous Grouse rose slightly to 13.3 percent.\nOverall export sales of The Famous Grouse were up five percent and sales in Europe rose 13 percent, with strong performances in France, Greece and the Netherlands, although conditions were more difficult in Asia.\nSingle malt whiskies continued to grow both at home and overseas with Highland's key brands, Highland Park from Orkney and Bunnahabhain from Islay, up 12 percent on a global basis.\nProfits from associate Robertson & Baxter fell nine percent to about 10 million pounds mainly because of increased advertising behind the Cutty Sark brand.\nSales of new and mature whiskies to blenders have grown considerably with new filling orders for the calendar year 1996 up by 31 percent.\nThe interest charge rose by 2.8 million pounds mainly due to the cost of carrying a 26 percent shareholding in distiller Macallan-Glenlivet Plc from January 1996.\nHighland and Suntory, Japan's leading Whisky distiller, already owned 51 percent of Macallan but decided in July to pay up to 88 million pounds to take control of the remaining 49 percent.\nHighland argues that the Macallan malt whisky brand has substantial growth potential.", "The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on Thursday launched a probe into the way travel companies sell foreign package holidays to millions of sun-seeking Britons.\nThe director-general of the consumer watchdog body, John Bridgeman, called a Monopolies and Mergers (MMC) inquiry into ownership links between leading tour operators such as Thomson and Airtours and retail travel agents.\nThe MMC will also be able to look at the practice among travel agents of offering holidays at a discount conditional on the purchase of specific travel insurance.\nBoth travel companies said they were confident they would be cleared by the 12-month MMC inquiry. But shares in Airtours plunged almost 10 percent in London, losing 69p to 644p.\nBridgeman noted that vertically-integrated companies like Thomson and Airtours supply a large proportion of a market worth seven billion pounds ($11.5 billion) and he was concerned that some of their practices could distort competition.\n\"I believe they have the market power to put competitors at a disadvantage, for example by de-racking (removing) or threatening to de-rack their brochures in an attempt to negotiate larger commissions,\" he said.\nHe also said they could pressurise tour operators not to supply independent travel agents on better terms or push their own holidays through in-house incentive schemes.\nThomson owns the leading Lunn Poly travel agency, while Airtours owns the number two travel agent Going Places.\nTogether they operate around 40 percent of British travel agents. They also supply around 45 percent of over 10 million foreign packages sold to Britons who make the annual pilgrimage to seek the sun around the Mediterranean or further afield.\nThomson, part of Canada's Thomson Corp, welcomed the probe.\n\"Thomson is confident that the industry at large, and Thomson in particular, will be vindicated from any allegations of anti-competitive practice,\" said Paul Brett, chairman and chief executive of Thomson Travel.\n\"We have been cleared by the OFT before in 1994 and we are sure that we will be cleared again by the MMC,\" he added.\nAirtours deputy chief executive Harry Coe said there was no case to answer and claimed the British market offered the world's cheapest foreign holidays.\n\"Those behind the inquiry are the small tour operators and the small travel agents who can't stand the heat in the kitchen,\" he said.\nBut the smaller tour operators were delighted that the MMC was taking up the matter.", "Just as the submarine changed the face of naval warfare in World War Two, Europe's shipbuilders are hoping a new breed of \"stealth\" warships will do the same in the 21st century.\nAt a trade fair at the business airport of Le Bourget, north of Paris, three shipbuilders were presenting their own version of combat ships with the ability to hide and deceive the enemy.\nBritish shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft was due on Tuesday to unveil its design for the Sea Wraith corvette at the Euronaval exhibition, which gathers the world's navies.\nBAeSema, a joint venture between British Aerospace Plc and France's Sema Group, launched its Cougar coastal corvette project on Monday.\nAnd French state-owned DCN shipyard presented its La Fayette frigate which it boasted was the first operational warship fully to use stealth features in its design.\nDCN builds the hulls, while it has linked up with French defence company Thomson CSF to provide the ship's communications, detection and weapons control systems.\nStealth warships use similar principles to the radar-beating technology developed by the U.S. aircraft industry and used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. The diamond-shaped F117 and batwing B2 bombers were designed to absorb or deflect radar.\nBut traditionalists who admire the sleek greyhound lines of warships would be dismayed to see the flat, angular shapes forced by the stealth technology which makes modern ships mere \"platforms\" for weapons and detection systems.\nThe La Fayette uses a slab-sided superstructure and non-metallic composite materials to confuse radar and missiles. The second of eight La Fayette-class ships ordered by Taiwan entered service last week, while Saudi Arabia has also ordered the French ship.\nBut the British are in hot pursuit with their own designs for a new generation of stealth vessels, which they say they are ready to build now. They have set their sights firmly on export markets for the first customers.\n\"We believe this is the warship of the future and all warships will need to use these techniques,\" Brian Spilman, Vosper's manager of future projects shipbuilding, told Reuters.\nThe Sea Wraith design puts the distinctive clutter of mast, radar dishes and aerials inside flat-sided towers and has shaped topsides, rather like diamond facings, to make it hard for radars to lock on. It also uses non-reflective composites.\nSea Wraith can alter its \"radar signature\" by lowering or raising the mast, making it difficult to recognise the craft. Two asymetrically-located masts are meant to confuse radar-guided missiles.\nTo counter new infra-red, or heat-seeking, missiles, the ship sprays a fine mist of water to conceal itself and its \"hot spots\" such as the exhaust.\nBAeSema is showcasing the Cougar patrol vessel, which uses low-acoustic waterjet propulsion instead of traditional noisy engines which are easily picked up by sonar.\nIts low, angular lines are typical of stealth designs for throwing off radar beams.\nBAe last week announced it was merging its naval systems activities into BAeSema, to boost its prime contractor role.\nPrime contractors bid for contracts in which their integration of radar, communications and defence systems provide the added value.\nBoth BAeSema and Vosper have declined to give prices for their ships, saying these depend on the systems requested.\nThomson-CSF, part of the French state-owned Thomson SA electronics group which is being privatised to the Lagardere conglomerate, is the prime contractor for the La Fayette under Sawari 1 and 2 contracts signed with Saudi Arabia.", "Two of Britain's leading insurance brokers Lloyd Thompson Group and JIB Group said on Monday they are to merge in a deal worth 300 million pounds ($496.4 million)\nLloyd Thompson chief executive Ken Carter said the main attraction of the deal was the complementary nature of the two companies' operations and the merger will create an international firm focused on profitable, growth businesses.\n\"The driver is not cost savings, it's entirely the business enhancements we can get out of the two groups coming together. The cost savings will be there but they would come out in the merger of any two companies,\" he said.\nCarter will become chief executive of the new group which is to be renamed Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc.\nThe deal comes at a time of increasing problems for brokers as insurance rates fall and revenues decline. Increasing competitive pressures are forcing many to contemplate deals to find a way of cutting costs and achieve economies of scale.\nOnly last week U.S. broking giant Aon Corp announced it was buying New York's Alexander & Alexander services for $1.23 billion.\n\"Insurance brokers are going through very difficult times and any activity that will enhance margins has to be beneficial,\" said one analyst. \"It's becoming quite evident that size is more and more important.\" Under the terms of the Lloyd's Thompson offer, JIB shareholders will receive four new Lloyd Thompson shares for every five JIB shares held. The companies said that deal was expected to be \"significantly earnings enhancing\" in 1998.\nThe merger has received the backing of Jardine Matheson Holdings which has a 60 percent stake in JIB. On completion of the merger it will have a 34 percent interest which it said, it intended to hold \"for the long term\".\nThe stock market reacted positively to the news. JIB shares rose 20-1/2p to 129-1/2p and Lloyd Thompson 1-1/2p to 174p.\nThe companies said they believed that the merger would bring significant strategic advantages allowing the development of new products, enhancing JIB's international operations and creating a leading international reinsurance business.\nThe deal would also deliver cost savings, in particular in the two London market operations' information technology and head office expenditure.\nLloyd Thompson, is currently involved predominantly in the London wholesale and reinsurance broking business. In contrast, JIB, operates in 30 countries worldwide and brings with it an international presence with the \"very significant jewel in the crown\" of its high quality Asia Pacific business, said Carter.\nThe newly merged group will be positioned between global brokers such as Britain's Sedgwick and Willis Corroon and smaller niche brokers such as Lowndes Lambert and C.E. Heath.\n\"We see Jardine fulfilling an essential demand from clients by being a strong international broker focussed on handling business wherever it is in the world outside the U.S. rather than looking to get a flag in every city in the world,\" said Carter.\nFollowing the merger John Barton, currently chief executive of JIB will become chairman of the new group which is to be headquartered in London.", "General Motor Corp's decision to invest 300 million pounds ($474.9 million) in Vauxhall Motors reflected confidence in its British operation and the international prospects for its Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.\nThe company said the three-year investment would be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.\nThe announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.\nVauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said in an interview that a possible decision on increasing the number of shifts at the plant to three from two could create hundreds more jobs.\nAny decision, likely to be taken over the next two years, would depend on the market and demand for the model at that time.\nThe Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.\nReilly said the 300 million pound investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to \"a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors.\"\nHe predicted strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.\nReilly said the British car market is currently \"the most competitive in Europe,\" with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars which remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained \"flat,\" he said.\nHe said Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and said its profitablity was \"going in the right direction\" after a tough 1995.", "Archer Daniels Midland Co. Monday said it agreed to plead guilty to two counts of federal charges of price fixing in the sale of agricultural products and to pay record fines totalling $100 million.\nUnder the agreement, which is subject to court approval, ADM will pay $70 million to settle a charge of fixing prices for lysine, a feed additive for livestock, and $30 million in connection with citric acid, a food and beverage additive.\nWhile the $100 million in fines were the largest ever in a criminal antitrust action, they will have only a minimal financial impact on the Decatur, Ill.-based agricultural products giant.\n\"This is not going to affect their balance sheet in any meaningful way,\" said NatWest Securities analyst David Nelson.\nADM has about $1.3 billion in cash and short-term securities on hand and another $1.1 billion in long-term securities it could sell if it needed to, analysts said.\nBut the settlement left unclear the fate of two top ADM executives who had been expected to face indictments in the government's four-year investigation of price-fixing for the food additives.\nIn a statement, ADM did not mention Vice Chairman Michael Andreas or Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining. The additives are derived from corn.\nADM had said in a proxy statement that indictments in the lysine probe were being considered against Wilson and Andreas, the son of ADM Chairman Dwayne Andreas.\n\"That's intriguing, that there is no mention (of) the individuals,\" said antitrust attorney Joe Sims, a partner in the Washington office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue who is not involved in the ADM antitrust case.\nSims called the wording of ADM's statement \"ambiguous.\"\nA government source said the Justice Department's antitrust investigation was \"ongoing.\" Department officials declined to comment.\nADM did not return a phone call requesting comment on the status of possible indictments against the executives.\nIn its statement, ADM said the agreement brought an end to the government probe into \"alleged misconduct\" by the company, including its practices in the market for high-fructose corn syrup, a widely used sweetener that is one of ADM's most important products.\nAnalysts said the high-fructose corn syrup case could have been the biggest potential liabilty for ADM, given the size of that market. ADM previously settled civil cases brought by its customers and agreed to pay $25 million in the lysine case and $35 million to buyers of its citric acid.\nA civil case brought by high-fructose corn syrup customers is pending.\n\"The important news here is just that the criminal investigation is behind them,\" said Bonnie Wittenburg, an analyst at Dain Bosworth, a Minneapolis-based brokerage.\nInvestors reacted positively to the settlement and sent ADM shares up 75 cents to $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, a 52-week high.\nThe federal probe of alleged price-fixing in the food and feed additive markets was first disclosed by ADM in June 1995. At that time, ADM said it was subpoenaed for documents and testimony as part of a probe of the lysine, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup markets.\nA former ADM executive, Mark Whitacre, acted as a government informant for about three years in the investigation. Whitacre, who was president of ADM's BioProducts Division, was fired in August 1995 when the company accused him of stealing $9.5 million.\nWhitacre has denied those charges and has said he plans to file a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against ADM.\nADM said the plea agreement resulted from negotiations between Justice Department officials and a special committee of seven independent board members.\nADM said the special committee was created in 1995 to respond to the department's investigation into ADM's alleged anti-competitive activity and related civil litigation.\nAnalysts also said the fate of Michael Andreas was not expected to impact the succession at ADM. \"That issue was settled a long time ago. Mick is not a successor,\" said George Dahlman at Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based brokerage, referring to Michael Andreas.\nIn an interview in January, Dwayne Andreas said he believed there were eight people who might succeed him some day, including his son. But he said at the time there was no succession plan at the company. ADM's proxy statement lists Dwayne Andreas' age at 78.", "Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa met a political opponent on Monday he has accused of badmouthing Hong Kong abroad in the run-up to Chinese rule, holding talks that appeared to strike a conciliatory note.\nHowever, Tung and Democratic Party leader Martin Lee, a fierce critic of China, remained poles apart on key issues at the heart of the democratic camp's worries about Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.\nIn a meeting he described as \"cooperative\" and \"good\", the second since the shipping magnate was selected in December as Hong Kong's future leader, Lee said his party allowed Tung to clarify his position if he believed he had been misinterpreted.\n\"If he thinks we have misunderstood him, he can tell us, so we can clear any misunderstanding,\" Lee told reporters.\nLee said he gave Tung a \"position paper\" highlighting issues Lee would be discussing with political and business leaders in an upcoming trip to the United States, Canada and Europe.\nThe paper stated what the Democrats saw as Tung's stance on key issues about Hong Kong's handover, giving the future leader a chance to clear up any misunderstandings over his position.\nLee, who has made many trips overseas to lobby against the provisional legislature and China's plans to roll back on rights and civil liberties at the handover, has been attacked by Tung in recent weeks for criticising Hong Kong abroad.\nBut the long-time champion of democracy in the territory, who will receive the National Endowment for Democracy's 1997 Democracy Award on Washington's Capitol Hill on April 9, said he would continue to go on his overseas lobbying trips.\nHe also dismissed suggestions from the media that the party would censor itself in the future.\n\"No, we will still speak (overseas), but if Mr Tung says he has been misunderstood, we will consider his views, we will definitely not be censoring ourselves,\" Lee said.\nThe party also stood firm against the provisional legislature.\n\"I told Mr Tung so long as this provisional legislature were to have its first, second, third readings on any bill before July 1, we will have no option but take it to court,\" he said.\nWith the handover just 106 days away, Hong Kong is awash with concerns over the impending end of its elected legislature and Beijing's plans to repeal or amend a string of laws protecting human rights and civil liberties.", "Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday said earnings jumped 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales and improved profit margins during the Christmas selling season.\n\"We ended the year with excellent fourth-quarter results, which are even more impressive given the strength of last year's fourth quarter,\" Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement.\nDecember included the company's first ever back-to-back billion-dollar sales weeks, he said. The Christmas season is crucial for retailers since store chains typically earn half or more of their annual profit during the period.\n\"They had a great 1996 capped off by the best Christmas of any department store operator,\" said Alan Rifkin, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. He noted that Sears' sales at comparable stores rose 9.5 percent in December.\nThe nation's second-largest retailer said earnings rose to $567 million, or $1.42 a share, in the quarter, from $455 million,  or $1.13 a share, in the 1995 period. Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion.\nThe earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.\nBut Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking.\n\"The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits,\" Rifkin said.\nAnalysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings.\n\"Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store,\" said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&P Equity Group.\nOperating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter.\nOperating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion.\nGross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period.\nRifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year.\nHe forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996.\nInternational operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period.\nThe increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said.\nSears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services.\nWhile earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995.\nFor all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.", "Some of the brightest stars of Chinese pop put on a glittering show in Beijing on Friday, but officials kept politically-suspect rock heroes off the playlist, sources close to the concert said.\nA capacity audience of around 18,000 flocked to the Capital Gymnasium to see a showcase event featuring dozens of performers from China's fledgling popular music industry.\nState media said the event, the first leg of a double concert in the capital, was intended to celebrate the growth of the pop music industry since it was banned as capitalist poison during the chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nThe concerts were intended to capture the flavour of the past decade of Chinese pop, but organisers had been ordered to cut some of the nation's biggest and most influential rock and roll stars from the playlist, sources close to the event said.\nThe Friday'A' concert, to be followed by a'B' performance on Saturday, was a showcase mainly for sugary pop songs largely focused on themes of love and friendship --  a staple diet for state-run music broadcasters.\nHarder-edged music -- unpopular among communist authorities keen to promote safe socialist loyalties -- was conspiciously absent.\nBeijing has repeatedly ordered campaigns to boost socialist morality weakened in the rush to a market economy, prompting tighter official controls on all forms of cultural activity.\nCui Jian, widely regarded as the father of Chinese rock music, was not scheduled to attend either concert, organisers said.\nSources close to the event said Cui, whose music is a blend of Western rock, Chinese instruments and politically-sensitive lyrics, had originally been intended to play a major part in the event but had been barred by China's musical mandarins.\nThe classically-trained performer's music is still hugely popular among listeners, but ideologically-suspect anthems such as \"Nothing to My Name' that caught the mood of a generation in the late 1980s are seldom permitted on state-controlled media.\n\"Cui's basically been banned from performing in Beijing since 1993,\" said a promoter close to the event who declined to be named. \"The higher-ups told the organisers...he couldn't take part.\"\nHeavy rock group Hei Bao, or Black Panther, which has won the hearts of many younger Chinese despite official disapproval, would also be absent, said concert promoter and radio presenter Zhang Shurong.\nZhang said he had not been told of any ban against Cui or Hei Bao, who have long been forced to seek venues far from the Chinese capital.\nHei Bao had not been banned but were considered unsuitable because they could make the audience too excited, he said, adding the stars still on the playlist were attraction enough.\n\"They are all very important, all people who can play epoch-making roles in the circle of Chinese singers,\" he said.", "With China's takeover of Hong Kong rapidly looming, the British colony faces a swirl of politics and diplomatic jousting in the week ahead, the last before China names the territory's first post-colonial governor.\nBritish and Chinese negotiators, often sparring over the details of the sovereignty transfer, will meet on Wednesday for three days in their latest bargaining round.\nChinese sources said China is likely to lash out during the Joint Liaison Group session at a British attempt to foist a soft subversion law on the territory before the mid-1997 handover.\nLast Tuesday Britain announced a draft bill that would make crimes such as subversion and sedition a crime only if they entailed violence, making clear mere dissident-style criticism of the authorities was not a crime.\nChina has denounced the move. \"This will only cause disruption and instability in Hong Kong,\" China's spokesman in Hong Kong Zhang Junsheng said on Friday. Some members of the pro-China lobby predicted the law would be replaced by a more Chinese-style legislation after the handover on July 1.\nThe territory is also preparing for a visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord on Wednesday.\nLord, who is also heading for China amid signs of a thaw in Sino-U.S. ties, plans to meet Governor Chris Patten and his deputy Anson Chan, as well as China's hardline envoy in the territory, Zhou Nan, and shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, the favourite in the contest to be the first post-colonial leader.\nCritics said Lord's meeting with Tung would be an undiplomatic signal from the United States tantamount to Washington picking the winner in the contest.\nFresh attacks on China are also expected on Wednesday from democrats in Hong Kong's elected legislature, which is set to be dissolved upon the handover and replaced with a new provisional body assembled under China's supervision.\nLast week a Selection Committee of 400 rich or influential Hong Kong people, formed under China's careful control, quizzed Tung and two rivals over their policies and attitude to China.\nTung, 59, emerged as the most vocally pro-China contender, loosing off a volley of remarks that stressed loyalty and patriotism to China, attacked Patten's politics and threw in a snub on the inauspicious quality of the governor's residence.\nThe tycoon also suggested the Democratic Party, the territory's largest, should stop confronting China if it wanted to participate in post-handover political establishment, which drew an attack from Patten.\n\"You can't, nobody can, freeze out of the political debate in Hong Kong, out of the dialogue about Hong Kong's future, those who represent majority opinion in Hong Kong,\" Patten told Hong Kong's government-funded radio on Saturday during his visit to Japan.\nThe 400-member Committee will meet again on December 11 to vote for the new chief executive. Most people now consider Tung's rivals Ti Liang Yang, a former chief judge, and businessman Peter Woo, rank outsiders.\nMany Hong Kong people were unimpressed by last week's performances, not least the territory's pro-democracy camp.\n\"Only empty promises and brief outlines were provided in their platforms,\" said legislator Fred Li of the Democratic Party.\nHe decried the fact Hong Kong's voters were not involved in choosing among the three contenders. \"All they need is the blessing of these 400 people,\" Li said.", "The Florida judge in a class-action suit against tobacco groups Thursday allowed one of the pioneering case's lead smokers to take a back seat in the upcoming trial after he complained of intimidation.\nStanley Rosenblatt, the lawyer pursuing the class-action suit on behalf of all ill and addicted smokers in Florida, said in Dade County Court that Arthur Reeves had been one of the original six smokers in the suit filed three years ago but did not want to take a prominent role as a witness in a trial scheduled for Sept. 8.\n\"He feels he has been greatly embarrassed and humiliated by investigators going out and asking neighbors and relatives and people he hasn't seen in 30 years about him,\" Rosenblatt said.\nThe lawyer gave no details in court, but said at a news conference Wednesday that private investigators working for tobacco companies routinely checked the backgrounds of people opposing them in court and potential trial jurors.\nRosenblatt asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Alan Postman to allow another smoker, throat-cancer victim Frank Amodeo of Orlando, Fla., to be substituted for Reeves.\nAmodeo said Wednesday he began smoking at 14, more than a decade before the health dangers of smoking were known, and that he has tried to stop smoking repeatedly. He still smokes and takes liquid nourishment through a feeding tube, since he can neither eat nor drink.\nRosenblatt said Reeves was not withdrawing from the suit, an option any ill smoker in Florida can choose, but would not act as a representive of the 500,000 potential claimants Rosenblatt has estimated his suit covers.\nReeves would share in money awards, if any, secured through the trial. The case appears likely to be the first to come to trial of a dozen or more class-action suits filed by smokers against tobacco companies.\nRosenblatt claims that tobacco companies such as Liggett Group, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Loews Corp. and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries conspired for decades to hide medical evidence damaging to their businesses and mislead Americans about the dangers of smoking.\nA lawyer for Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said that allowing the switch just months before trial was unfair.\nThe lawyer, Philip Heim, said he had no knowledge of Reeves' complaints. \"I don't know anything about him being allegedly harassed,\" Heim said.", "Czech power producer CEZ a.s. on Friday said its nine month net profit hit 8.4 billion crowns, up from 7.4 billion for the same period last year, according to international accounting standards, as household electricity demand surged.\nCEZ's Director of Planning and Analysis section Petr Voboril told a news conference that higher depriciation write-offs due to the opening of new installations cut the company's tax obligations, and boosting its bottom line.\nThe company's gross profit for the period remained flat at 13.1 billion.\nCzech accounting put the firm's profit for the first nine months at 7.04 billion, up from 6.7 billion last year.\nCEZ said the result did not change the firm's profit forecast under Czech standards for the whole year, which is 8.1 billion crowns, equal to last year's.\nA financial statement showed CEZ wrote off 4.1 billion in the first nine months compared with 3.4 billion in the same period of 1995, and paid 4.7 billion in income tax after 5.7 billion last year.\n\"Above all, lowering of tax obligations in connection with depriciation policy have influenced this (profit) increase,\" Voboril said.\nHe said that overall demand for electricity rose by 5.5 percent in the period, and is expected to reach a record high of 55.3 terrawatthours, 6.1 percent up year-on-year, for the whole 1996.\nHousehold consumption drove the increase, rising 10.5 percent, while large clients demanded almost two percent more power over the same period of the last year.\nVoboril said that a recent ruling by the Finance Minstry on maximum prices CEZ can charge regional power distributors did not effect results thanks to the sales increase.\nThe ministry decided that the maximum average price CEZ can charge for supplies this year is 1,035 crowns per megawatthour, up two crowns from the last year but below the firm's 1,040 crown expectation included in business plan.\nVoboril said that short-term indebtedness of CEZ increased as well as financial expenditures due to unpaid recievables from some of the eight regional distributors, which totalled 3.2 billion crowns as of September 30.\nCEZ and six of the country's eight regional grid operators had been locked in a price dispute with CEZ until the ministry ruling last month.\nCEZ is also considering an international bond issue next year as it needs financing but has already flooded the domestic market with paper, Voboril said.\nLocal analysts welcomed the results but said they did not expect them to help CEZ's share price much as the Prague Stock Exchange is plagued by a lack of confidence.\n\"The CEZ results are slightly better than I expected. CEZ is fundamentally undervalued but genereal market sentiment is not very strong,\" said Petr Dousa of Zivnostenska Banka. \"I don't expect the price to go up to 1,000 in the next few days.\"\nCEZ shares closed up 14 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange on Friday to close at 937.", "Texas Instruments Inc. said Tuesday it set a licensing pact with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. of Korea that will generate royalty payments of more than $1 billion over 10 years.\nIn exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other.\nThe agreement replaces a previous five-year deal that expired at the end of 1995, the Dallas-based maker of computer chips, notebook computers and other electronics products said.\nWhile the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995.\n\"Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said.\n\"Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement,\" Kurlak said of the royalty formula Samsung will use to pay Texas Instruments.\nThe new license, which runs until the end of 2005, covers a broad base of patents from both companies, including those for semiconductors, personal computers, consumer products and telecommunications equipment, Texas Instruments said.\n\"We are pleased with this agreement and the value it places on our patented technology,\" said Richard Agnich, a senior vice president and general counsel at Dallas-based Texas Instruments.\nThe company in 1985 started to more aggressively defend alleged unauthorised use of its technology in a bid to improve the value of its intellectual property within the semiconductor industry. In the intervening decade, the company has won billions of dollars in additional royalties, a spokesman said.\nTexas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it about $105 million in the fourth quarter for \"catch-up royalties\" covering the first nine months of 1996 when the companies were battling in court.\nAnalysts said the \"catch up\" payments should substantially boost earnings for the quarter ending in December, but the gain will be offset by a charge for an undisclosed amount the company plans to take for an early retirmement programme.\nKurlak estimated Texas Instruments will see $35 million in additional quarterly royalties going forward as a result of the Samsung deal, but that is down from the roughly $85 million it received quarterly from Samsung at the end of 1995.\nWith this deal, Texas Instruments said it has almost completed its 1995 round of patent cross-license agreements with major semiconductor makers.\nEarlier in the year, Texas Instruments reached 10-year deals with Fujitsu Ltd., Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.\nIt said talks continue with NEC Corp. and several smaller producers.\nThe royalty payments will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business, analysts said.\nTexas Instrument stock jumped $4.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.", "Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc, Australian media analysts said on Monday.\nThey said News, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group.\n\"It means they'll be in bed with a bigger more powerful global telephony group,\" one senior Sydney media analyst said.  \nAnalysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. \"It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,\" said the senior Sydney analyst.\nThe prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares in the last month. \"There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,\" said another Sydney analyst.  \n\"The implications for News are quite positive,\" the analyst said.\nA Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to  to sell down their stake over the next 12 months. \"The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,\" the analyst said.\nMCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake up to 13.5 percent. They agreed, amoug other things, to jointly set up an American satelite television operation -- ASkyB.  \nBut progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire.\nHowever, the Australian analysts said they would remain somewhat cautious given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI.\nMCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.\nAnalysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.  \nBut MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts also told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI would sell to News a US$700 million satellite license if it could.\nHe also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.\nAnalysts also said there was the potential for a regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc and BT.  \n\"There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,\" said another BT analyst.\nOther analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.\n\"They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,\" said another Sydney analyst.  \nHowever another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.", "Scotland-based hotels and casinos group Stakis on Thursday said it will buy Lonrho Plc's five Metropole hotels, funding the 327 million pound ($530 million) deal with a huge cash call on shareholders.\nStakis, which operates 46 British hotels and 22 casinos -- and whose current market value is only about 472 million pounds -- said it wanted to raise 222 million pounds via a heavyweight four-for-seven rights issue, set at 82 pence per share.\n\"We've found a reasonable and sensible price for a very good, perhaps unique, product,\" Stakis chief executive David Michels told a news conference.\nLonrho, which is in the throes of a demerger, said in a separate statement that the disposal would generate net proceeds of 316 million pounds as well as payments of 63 million pounds in dividends and tax relief that it will receive from the chain.\n\"The proposed sale of Metropole Hotels represents an important step in the separation of Lonrho's mining and non-mining assets...,\" said Lonrho chairman John Leahy, adding that the firm was continuing to make progress with its demerger.\nLast month, Lonrho shelved plans for a 700 million pound flotation of its Metropole and its North American-based Princess luxury resort hotels because of the level of interest it had received from potential buyers.\nSaudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal has been tipped as the most likely buyer of the 10 five-star Princess hotels. Lonrho expects to announce the sale in about three weeks.\nThe sale of the hotels, which will be followed by the divestment of the group's African trading operations, is part of Lonrho's plans to turn itself into a focused mining company and ends 30 years of empire building by founder Tiny Rowland.\nStakis had been the front-runner to buy the conglomerate's Metropole chain -- four-star hotels with extensive conference facilities -- since rival Millennium & Copthorne Hotels pulled out of the bidding race earlier this month.\nThe hotels group said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings from the first year and forecast 1996 group profit before tax and exceptionals would be over 30.6 million pounds.\nStakis also forecast a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share, giving a total payout of 2.15 pence for the full year -- 23 percent more than last year.\nThe company, which had been in acquisition talks with Lonrho for about 15 months, plans to cut costs at the hotels and boost profits by boosting occupancy -- currently at about 68 percent.\nAnalysts welcomed the deal. \"The numbers stack up. I have no problem with their strategy,\" said Matthew Nayler, leisure analyst at brokers Williams de Broe.\nAnalysts estimate that Stakis will have to boost profits at the hotels -- in the cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside resorts of Brighton and Blackpool -- by at least 12 percent for the purchase to be profitable.\nIn an innovative move by investment bank Schroders that will save Stakis some money on commissions, the bank is arranging a partial tender for sub-underwriting of the rights issue by investment institutions in which sub-underwriters will be allowed to tender at lower commissions for additional sub- underwriting above their initial allocations.\nSchroders will then cut the primary underwriting commission charged to Stakis at the same rate as any reduction in total sub-underwriting charges.\n\"We may lose money but we think change (to commission rates) is inevitable,\" Schroders' Robert Swannell told reporters.\nThe market is now awaiting news on Lonrho's sale of the Princess hotels, which include resorts in Acapulco, Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S.\nA Lonrho spokesman said news on this was expected in approximately three weeks.\nFinancial sources in the Gulf said earlier this month that the Saudi prince had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal and that the price was $300 million. The prince's key western investments include stakes in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, banking group Citicorp and the Disneyland Paris theme park.", "Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co (BHP) posted a 9.8-percent fall in first-half profits on Friday, disappointing the share market but avoiding another mauling by investors.\nBHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, posted a A$790 million (US$628 million) net profit for the six months to November 30, down from A$867 for the same period last year.\nBut Australia's largest quoted company had its bottom line boosted by an abnormal gain of A$107 million and investors were initially not impressed.\nThe share price were up 54 cents to a high of A$17.59 just after the result then took a tumble and settled at around A$17.20 in early afternoon trading.\nBut late buying across the board helped BHP, the market bellwether stock, recover ground and the stock closed at A$17.48, 43 three cents higher than Thursday's close.\n\"It's pretty lousy,\" one fund manager's stock analyst told Reuters soon after the release. Another analyst disappointed with the result said the resources giant was still on track for a modest profit recovery for the full year to May 31, 1997.\nThough forecast signs of improvement emerged in BHP's battered copper division, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had been tipping a first-half group pre-abnormal result of around A$760 million.\nBHP's pre-abnormal net profit of A$683 million was 15.8 percent down on the corresponding 1995/96 period.\nBut managing director John Prescott said the second quarter figures showed an accelerating improvement in performance and that, despite weak copper and steel prices, the group was still investing in future growth.\nCiting a sharp jump in exploration expenditure in the half year, he told reporters: \"That's an important part of sustaining our growth.\"\n\"I think we are moving ahead,\" he added. \"We have a lot of work to do and we're going to build the company around its high-quality assets and we are starting to see the results of our work.\"\nIncluding abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed higher earnings in the latest three months against the August quarter. The steel division was flat.\nPetroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million for the quarter, but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.\nBHP Petroleum's pre-abormal result also included a A$82 million windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.\nBHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million, due largely to higher world prices.\nBHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of seven U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second quarter profit of A$132 million, up from A$85 million in the first quarter.\nThe U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said on Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.\nBHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million.", "Just days after a U.S. graduate student cracked the most powerful computer encryption system allowed out of the country, the Commerce Department announced it would allow three companies to export an even stronger system.\nUntil this year, computer encryption programmes, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key,\" were classified as munitions and stronger programmes could not be exported.\nBut under a controversial new Clinton administration policy that took effect Jan. 1, companies may recieve permission to export stronger programmes.\n\"I'm happy that we've been able to do this within the first month without rancour or difficulty,\" Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch said in a telephone interview.\nTo export stronger programmes immediately, companies must agree to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the software keys.\nThe adminstration's policy has been widely criticised as not relaxing the export limits enough and some companies feared the requirement for a two-year plan would substantially delay export approvals.\nThe quick approvals should quell some of the criticism and encourage more applicants, Reinsch said.\n\"As a result of this, you will have more companies taking it seriously and we will expect more plans over the next couple of months,\" he said.\nEncryption was once the realm of spies and generals. But with the explosion of online commerce on the Internet, encryption has become a vital tool for protecting everything from a business' e-mail message to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Net.\nThe amount of protection afforded by encryption is largely a function of the length of the software key measured in bits, the smallest unit of computer data.\nCompanies said products with just 40-bit long keys, the old limit, were too easy to crack. The approvals came just days after Ian Goldberg, a graduate student at the University of California, cracked a message encoded with a sofware key 40-bits long.\nThe government did not name the companies on Friday given permission to export stronger, 56-bit programmes, but Glenwood, Maryland-based Trusted Information Systems acknowledged that it was one of the three.\n\"Recent attacks on 40-bit encryption have shown that a global move to at least 56-bit (U.S. government standard) security must come soon,\" Trusted Information Executive Vice President Steven Lipner said.", "China's once strained ties with the United States have improved dramatically in recent months with a series of top level visits healing some of the old wounds.\nBut as the two nations move closer, the United States is sidestepping one of China's most sensitive figures -- Premier Li Peng -- who is still too closely linked to the 1989 crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, diplomats said on Sunday.\nThey said that Li is one Chinese leader who does not fit into the agenda for a visit to Washington.\n\"It may be a bit unfair but he is the one leader everyone remembers for his role in the (1989) crackdown,\" said a senior foreign diplomat.\nLast month U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made his first visit to China in two years, setting the stage for the series of meetings between other high ranking officials of the two countries.\nDuring Christopher's visit, the two sides reached an understanding that their relationship should not be side-tracked by any one issue. That meant contacts would proceed despite continued disagreements over a range of issues from human rights, to trade and China's political rivalry with Taiwan.\nChinese Minister of Defence Chi Haotian is now in the United States after twice delaying a visit -- both times due to tension over Taiwan. He met President Bill Clinton on Monday last week.\nClinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines last month, and an exchange of visits by the two leaders is planned over 1997 and 1998.\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore is expected to visit China some time during the first half of next year.\nBut there is no talk yet of a return visit to the United States by Premier Li, Gore's counterpart in the Chinese government.\nU.S. officials in Beijing played down the lack of an invitation, saying the timing of the Gore visit itself had not been set.\nOther foreign analysts said an invitation would be made but there was little chance of a visit before a new premier takes office in 1998.\nChina is expected to sort out its leadership line-up at the Communist Party congress late next year and then formally install new government figures at the parliament meeting in March 1998.\n\"They (the Americans) seem to be waiting for the selection of the next premier,\" said another foreign diplomat.\nWestern leaders, including Americans, have been willing to meet Li in China. But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.\nLi has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.\nPresident Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.\nLi has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.", "A midnight Sunday strike deadline for General Motors Corp expired without a walkout as talks between the car maker and the United Auto Workers continued into the early morning hours on Monday.\nA GM spokesman declined to provide further details of the negotiations, saying the automaker would make a more detailed statement later on Monday morning.\n\"They're still on the job,\" said Norman Harp, a union commiteeman for UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, transmission plant, which started its third shift shortly before midnight Sunday.\n\"The deadline's here and gone and they're still talking,\" Harp said of the negotiators at GM's Detroit headquarters.\nLocal UAW officials at other GM plants also said they were told to stand by for further instructions.\nThe UAW cancelled its national contract covering 215,000 GM hourly workers one minute before midnight Sunday in a move to increase pressure on GM for tentative agreement.\nHowever, there was speculation among UAW officials late Sunday that instead of a national strike, the union could strike selected plants that make GM's high-profit light trucks. Top on the list of such facilities were GM's Janesville, Wis., plant, which makes Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Suburban full-size sport/utility vehicles, and the Pontiac, Mich., plant, which makes GM's popular full-size pickup trucks with extended cabs.\nA selective strike at those facilities would inflict pain on GM while minimizing the drain on the UAW's strike fund, which pays each UAW worker $150 a week. It also would blunt some of the political fallout from a massive strike close to the U.S. presidential election.\nUAW officials say the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand that GM follow the pattern set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp by guaranteeing employment for 95 percent of its current UAW workforce.\nGM, which has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive, wants to exclude several of those facilities from the guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.\nIn settling the Canadian strike last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants in Windsor and Oshawa, Ontario and retained some flexibility to outsource more products. However, GM agreed to guarantee pensions for workers in the two plants or up to nine years and to allow them to transfer back to jobs that open up in other GM facilities.\nGM still has more than 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico idled because of lingering parts shortages associated with the Canadian strike.", "Authorities in central China's Anhui province have ordered three pro-democracy activists to stand trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, a human rights group said on Monday.\nThe Hefei Intermediate People's Court in the Anhui capital was scheduled to try dissidents Shen Liangqing, Ma Lianggang and Huang Xiuming on Tuesday, New York-based watchdog Human Rights in China said in a statement.\nA court official in Hefei contacted by telephone declined to comment on the case, saying questions related to it touched on matters that had \"not been made public\".\nThe group said the trial would be the latest step in a state crackdown on dissent that has seen many of the main figures in China's struggling pro-democracy movement disappear into prison or administrative detention.\nThere was little doubt about the likely result of the trial of Shen, Ma and Huang, all of whom had been detained at least once since they took part in an ill-fated campaign for more democracy in 1989, the U.S. group said.\n\"Although they must go for trial on (November) 26th, it has already been decided that they are guilty and must be punished,\" it said.\nAll were unemployed, though Shen had been a government official and Huang a manager at a company. Ma had been a student.\nThe evidence against the three stemmed from articles written and distributed in 1991, and for which all had already been detained for more than a year, the human rights group said.\n\"To suddenly try them again now is a typical case in the Chinese government's strict nationwide suppression of dissidents,\" it said.\nEarlier this month, a Beijing court took just 10 minutes to reject the appeal of leading dissident Wang Dan and uphold his 11-year prison sentence for subversion.\nThe trial and failed appeal of the former student leader were part of a series of crushing blows delivered by authorities to China's tiny band of political dissenters.\nVisiting U.S. and European officials and politicians have raised the case of jailed dissidents in talks with Chinese leaders, but have said individual human rights cases should not be allowed to disrupt overall ties.\nChina dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.\nHuman Rights in Asia said observers were being denied access to the trial of the three Anhui dissidents, although the proceedings were officially open.\n\"It is believed this is another trial in which society and the free media are not permitted to understand the real situation,\" the group said.\nThe intermediate court official said he could not confirm any details of the case.\n\"We cannot answer over the phone, because this concerns a matter that has not been made public,\" the official said.", "Intense haggling among the world's trade ministers has brought within grasp a lucrative deal to free the global information technology market, officials said Tuesday, and some said they saw movement on the contentious issue of labour standards.\nBig powers, notably the United States and the European Union, said a flurry of talks during the second day of the World Trade Organisation ministerial conference had inched toward a global pact to eliminate tariffs on the $600 billion market for information technology.\nDifferences appeared to narrow on standards to regulate cheap labour and child workers.\nWTO officials want a final declaration at the close of the first ministerial meeting of the fledgling trade body on Friday that would point the WTO down the free trade path into the 21st century.\nThe EU, along with the United States, Canada and Japan, was making progress to reach consensus on an Information Technology Agreement that would be the crowning achievement of the meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters.\n\"We are making a lot of progress,\" Brittan said after a lunchtime meeting of the four major trading partners to discuss types of products to be covered and timing of tariff reductions.\nActing U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy said she concurred with Brittan's comments, but declined to say anything more on the proposed pact to remove tariffs on computer products by 2000.\n\"There is no question that what the industrialised countries now hope for most here is a deal on information technology products and agreement to work hard for a basic telecommunications pact by February,\" said one key negotiator.\nSignals from negotiators left little doubt the major traders were aiming for agreement as quickly as possible -- perhaps by Wednesday -- to convince Asian trading partners to sign on to the agreement by the end of the meeting on Friday.\nJapan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the conference he hoped \"ardently..... that we will have an agreement as the most significant achievement of this ministerial conference in the area of trade liberalisation.\"\nHowever, several Asian nations voiced reservations, with Malaysia saying the goal of free commerce in infotechnology by the turn of the century was too ambitious.\n\"We did not come here to discuss the Information Technology Agreement,\" International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said. \"All negotiations should be done in Geneva.\"\nThe 128 full delegations from WTO member countries and ministers and officials from nearly 30 others waiting to be admitted heard ringing appeals for progress toward a telecommunications liberalisation pact with a deadline set for mid-February.\nAnother late-night meeting was called on the issue of labour standards, which has emerged as the most divisive at the meeting.\nA Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters that some developing countries that had opposed any mention of the labour issue in the final declaration were taking a more positive position. \"A possibility of an agreement has emerged,\" he said, but addded that some hard-core emerging economies were holding out.\nIndia, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, have been insisting on no mention at all, arguing that even a neutral phrasing would suggest work conditions were a subject for the WTO.\nAiming to counter lobbying by sceptical Western-based aid groups, the WTO insisted that the poorest nations stood to reap major benefit from the freeing of global commerce.\nBut WTO officials admitted that Director-General Renato Ruggiero had failed to convince richer members, both industrialised and emerging economies, to remove all tariffs and other barriers affecting goods from the laggard states.\nThe European Union made little headway in efforts to persuade its main trading partners to jump-start stalled talks on China's bid for WTO admission. But Russia, another major member-in-waiting, expected to win entry by the end of 1997, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said.", "British media and leisure firm Pearson, awaiting the arrival of a new chief executive, enjoyed a stock market rally on Wednesday after a trading statement which analysts said contained no nasty surprises.\nPearson shares had gained 25p to 714 1/2p by 1300 GMT as a steady trading statement confounded the pessimists who had pushed the shares down to two-month lows on Tuesday.\nTexan Marjorie Scardino will take over as Pearson chief executive from January, becoming the first woman to head one of Britain's top 100 companies.\nScardino, who is moving from the 50-percent Pearson-owned Economist Group, is on record as saying that Pearson's profit performance is not good enough.\nMany share analysts say that Pearson has yet to complete its 1990s journey from industrial conglomerate to focused media company and that disposals are likely.\nThey believe Scardino may sell off the company's merchant banking interests and its Tussauds Group theme park and exhibition unit but they expect her to take her time before beginning to mould the company in her image.\nPearson has a 50 percent stake in London merchant bank Lazard Brothers and nine percent holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.\nThe Tussauds portfolio includes London's famous Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in the UK and Port Aventura in Spain.\nThere was a sense of relief after Pearson, which has interests ranging from newspaper and book publishing to television, said that trading conditions in the second half of the current year were in line with those of the first six months.\n\"All in all, it's in line with expectations but that in itself is good as the last few trading updates from the company have been disappointing,\" said Anthony de Larrinaga of brokers Panmure Gordon.\nPearson said that total video retuning costs associated with the launch of the Channel 5 terrestrial television channel next March would rise to around 150 million pounds ($250 million).\nThis is almost treble the sum initially earmarked for dealing with video recorders affected by interference from the new channel's signal. But it is below the figure quoted in some recent media reports.\nChannel 5 has recently been awarded an extra frequency to boost its coverage to 80 percent of the country and Pearson said its business plan showed significantly higher rates of return than in the original bid.\nPearson said the retuning costs and a major film deal with Fox would come out of the 300 million pound original funding agreed by the Channel 5 shareholders. The other shareholders are Britain's United News & Media, U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus and Luxembourg broadcast group CLT.\nThis year's losses from Mindscape, Pearson's ailing U.S. consumer software unit, should be in line with earlier forecasts of around 46 million pounds. Pearson also saw no real impact on its 1996 profits from the current strength of sterling.", "Ice cream had a sad time in Europe this summer, adding fresh impetus for the big makers to try to persuade us to eat it in the winter.\n\"We think for Unilever its meant 125 million pounds ($198.4 million) in lost sales and lost profits of 50 million in the summer months across europe,\" said David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.\nThe dull summer has hit impulse purchases of ice creams worst of all, a high-margin sector that makes up one third of all European ice cream sales.\nCoca-Cola, sometimes taken as a benchmark for consumer spending behaviour, reported a 10 percent decline in case sales in Germany, 17 percent down in Britain and four percent down in France as a result of the poor summer.\nIt's no surprise then to find marketing executives at Wall's and Nestle scurrying for new products to sell in the winter months.\nBritain's Birds Eye Wall's, owned by Unilever, said it has launched seven new lines across its impulse, take-home and multipack sectors as chocolate indulgences for the winter months.\nNestle is trying to roll out products like its Christmas Log in France to even out the seasonal swing in sales.\nBoth companies argue if people in Norway and Sweden, where the climate is cooler, can eat twice as much ice cream than in Britain, then there is work to be done.\n\"The snag is that in summer when people are on holiday that is when impulse sales are always at their highest, people just don't associate having an ice cream with winter,\" said John Campbell, an analyst at Paribas.\nIndustry watchers also point out that children, who account for 40 percent of all impulse icecream sales, take their longest holidays in the summer.\nWall's, the largest player in the British icecream market worth about 1.0 billion pounds estimates some 60 million pounds of the market growth in 1995 came from the very hot summer.\nWall's brands account for 17 out of the top 20 selling impulse brands with Wall's Solero heading up the league followed by Magnum White and Magnum Classic.\nIn terms of total market share Wall's has 43 percent in Britain, Nestle Lyons Maid 12 percent, Mars 7 percent, own label 29 percent and others 9 percent.\nIn a week of indifferent summer weather Wall's sells about 23 to 25 million portions of icecream whereas in a hot sunny week this figure can rise to around 55 million portions.\nThe big players in the 15 billion pounds European icecream market have come down with a thud from the summer of 1995.\nIt was the third hottest summer on record in Europe and August the hottest and sunniest ever -- with long periods of temperatures above 16 degrees centigrade, at which point consumers really switch into buying icecream.\nTemperatures soared to an average 17.5 degrees centigrade in Britain with 7.8 hours of sunshine a day compared with 7.2 hours in 1996. Statistics from the MetOffice, Britain's national weather centre, show an average temperature of 15.9 degrees for the summer of 1996. The office says the South of France and Spain had just an average summer this year.\nNestle, who entered the UK market in 1992 with the purchase of the Lyons Maid brand, estimates total sales in Britain are down some 5 percent at 879 million due to the dull summer, of this hand held icecreams accounted for 489 million.\nIn Britain the all-time Summer record for Wall's still stands at 71 million portions sold during one week in the long, hot summer of 1976 -- the year when Wall's Cornetto first hit the market.\nHowever much the big fridge fillers spend on advertising and dreaming up new products it will be hard to break that record.", "Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB.\nLear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms.\nBased in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry.\nBorealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people.\nPrimary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB.\nBorealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS.\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions.\nLear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels.\n\"Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,\" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.\nThe deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million.\nLear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components.\nThe company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.\nLear's competitors are also pursuing the same acquisition strategy.\nJohnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash.\nCanada's Magna International Inc., one of the \"Big Three\" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas & Lomason Co. for $135 million.", "Like an ageing prizefighter, AT&T Corp is destined to slug it out with vigorous rivals both big and small in the $75 billion long distance telephone arena, with no lift in earnings performance in sight.\nThough AT&T has just started to improve its marketing punch, share analysts say by the time it shows up in earnings it will be facing fresh opponents -- muscular regional Bells.\n\"It is hard to find a positive medium-term outlook for AT&T,\" said Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns, adding that more attractive stocks could be found elsewhere.  \nThursday's third quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, revised after September's profits warning.  But few analysts give hope for a quick profit rebound now that the company's fortunes are so clearly tied to its long distance marketplace.\nAT&T earlier reported a 12 percent earnings per share decline to $0.84 from $0.96 a year ago -- with increased competition and higher marketing expenses hitting long distance -- while financial services sank into losses.  \n\"I don't see much earnings improvement next quarter or in the first two 1997 quarters,\" said Simon Flannery of brokers J.P. Morgan.  The shares were 1/2 lower at $39-3/8.\nAT&T said it has been encouraged by early responses to its new $0.15 a minute flat price for long distance, and analysts say this should stem the weakness for now.\nAT&T has a higher proportion of revenues from the consumer long distance market place than its two archrivals MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp.  \nThe spinoff of Lucent Technologies Inc in September and of NCR Corp at the end of 1996, plus numerous unit sales, can only tighten the dependence.\nCompanies like GTE Corp -- which took half a million long distance customers in its first six months -- and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp are entering the market in a big way, mostly in the consumer area.\nThey join hundreds of tiny aggressive companies like Excel Communications Inc, which lease the circuits of the big players and then compete with them at low prices.  \nBy the second half of 1997, dependent on the state of a legal tussle over U.S. Federal Communications Commission resale rules, regional Bells will be starting to enter the long distance market themselves.\nBy this time AT&T, like other long distance players, is hoping to offer local calling using the circuits of the regional Bells. But the legal challenge led by GTE may succeed in shutting the FCC out of the resale pricing process.\n\"If so, it will cost AT&T more to get into the local market,\" Massick said.  \nMajor players by then will be starting to offer packages including wireless, local and long distance and in some cases satellite or cable television too, all on one bill.\nThis should shut out some of the small resellers and throw the fight onto brand names, where AT&T should be strong -- but the outcome is far from clear, analysts say.\nIn the meantime, they are hoping for strong action at the loss-making Universal Card credit card unit.\n\"The credit card business was very disappointing; that's something to watch going forward,\" Flannery said.", "A decision on the fate of ailing airline Air Liberte is not due until the start of next week and no bidder has yet formally submitted an offer to acquire the company, the president of the Creteil commercial court said.\n\"At the moment, no bid has been submitted,\" Dominique Leveque told Reuters by telephone. He denied newspaper reports that there was a 1400 GMT deadline for the bids.\n\"Bids have to be in today. That can be this afternoon or this evening. We are not going to close the mailbox,\" Leveque said.\nHe said the court would on Tuesday afternoon at the earliest make a statement about the bid or bids. After that it would study the offers.\n\"According to the law we have six months to study the situation. But it is clear that the company's cash position cannot hold another six months,\" he said.\n\"We will do all we can but the court cannot decide in 48 hours,\" Leveque said, adding a decision was due at the start of next week at the earliest.\nBritish Airways is preparing a bid for the regional airline, proposing to merge it with its French TAT unit.  \nA spokesman for British Airways in London said the company feared the French government would like a French company to acquire Liberte to prevent BA or another foreign airline from obtaining the carrier and its valuable slots at Orly airport.\nAir Liberte owns between 20 and 25 percent of the slots at Orly, Paris' second largest airport specialising in domestic routes, which represents 20,000 take-offs and landings per year.\nAir Liberte lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 and has debts of 1.5 billion francs. The company was placed under bankruptcy protection on September 26 after merger talks with other French airline AOM failed.  \nJacques Maillot, head of French travel company Nouvelles Frontieres and charter airline Corsair, said he planned to bid for both Air Liberte and AOM.\nAOM, formerly Air Outre-Mer, is being put on sale by the state agency Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which is divesting former Credit Lyonnais assets.\nRichard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said last week he might also bid for Air Liberte if BA did so. But a Virgin executive told Le Monde on Monday that the company was not yet sure whether a bid for Air Liberte was the best way to develop its business in France.  \nAir Liberte is owned 32.3 percent by Groupe Rivaud. Banque Indosuez has 13 percent, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) 12 percent, Euralair 10 percent, Club Mediterranee has 8.5 percent, Lyonnaise de Banque 6.2 percent and SAE five percent.\nChairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine has six percent and other interests have the remaining seven percent.\nAir Liberte expanded its network rapidly in the past year, making full use of the opening up of the big national routes such as Paris-Marseilles, Paris-Toulouse, Paris-Nice and Paris-Bordeaux.\nAir France unit Air Inter, renamed Air France Europe, previously had a monopoly over these routes.\nAir Liberte, AOM, Eurolair, BA's TAT and others cut their prices in order to win market share on the routes prior to the complete opening up of the French -- and European -- air market in 1997.\nBut Air Liberte was unable to fill its planes and posted losses. The company also claimed it suffered from a forced regrouping of its activities to Orly Sud terminal, while Air France and Air France Europe remained based in Orly Ouest.", "The recent surge in the Australian dollar and higher jet fuel prices are going to hurt exporters of fresh food in particular, according to Australian Federation of International Forwarders (AFIF) chief executive Brian Lovell.\n\"With the rise in the fuel price and the higher Australian dollar it is going to affect a lot of exporters,\" Lovell said.\n\"The hardest hit are going to be the perishible exports,\" Lovell said, referring to Australia's fresh food exporters to mainly to Asian countries.\nLovell said exporters, who had entered contracts before the recent freight rate hike, could now be finding they cannot meet their contract obligations due to the extra charge.\n\"This can really affect things as you might have signed the contract and then suddenly realised that you can't afford to move it,\" Lovell told Reuters in an interview.\n\"There are some people that won't be able to get out of a binding contract,\" Lovell said.\nLovell said many AFIF members were surprised by the freight rate rises by some local air carriers, due to the strength of the local dollar, which had given carriers greater buying power.\n\"They are buying fuel now more cheaply,\" Lowell said.\nQantas Airways Ltd has increased its jet fuel surcharge, while Ansett Airlines Ltd has kept its freight rates unchanged.\nThe Australian dollar has risen four percent to its current level of US$0.8000 over the past five months.\nLovell said that although airfreight volumes had been growing over recent years, there was now a move by exporters to transport perishable goods to Asia by fast ferry.\n\"I would say in the next 10 years we will see a lot more freight carried by fast ferries, as it is more economical to carry them by ferry than plane as fuel costs are lower.\"\nLovell said some of the AFIF's 250 members were in dispute with some of the airports over the management of cargo terminals, but this had not impeded freight movement.\nAFIF was formed in October following the merger of Australian Dederation of Air Freight Forwarders and the International Forwarders Association of Australia.", "British Airways Plc (BA) said on Tuesday that it had no plans for new alliances over the next few years, but would extend its global reach by franchising its popular brand name to smaller airlines.\nBritish Airways has an alliance with Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd and formed an alliance with American Airlines in June, although this is subject to regulatory approvals and a legal suit by USAir Group, in which BA holds 24.6 percent.\n\"One of the great challenges of alliance development is the management challenge and I think it would be unwise to take on any more than we can absorb at any one time,\" BA chief executive Robert Ayling said at an industry luncheon in Sydney.\nReports that BA would look to an alliance with a Japanese airline, notably Japan Airlines, were quashed by Ayling in a speech to the National Aviation Press Club in Sydney.\n\"I think the Japanese airline industry is an independent industry and I think it will remain a strongly independent industry. If there are opportunities in the future for developing relationships there with other carriers then obviously we will do that,\" Ayling said.  \nHowever, Ayling said the airline's four-year experiment with franchising its brand name to smaller airlines was successful and would be an area of future growth, providing safety and customer service standards were met.\n\"It is a way of bringing extended services to customers and of allowing operators of smaller airlines, who would have found it very difficult to survive in this world of global networks, to be more successful,\" Ayling said.\nIn June, BA signed its first franchise agreement outside of the European Union with South Africa's largest independent carrier, Comair. Under the deal Comair's eight-jet fleet will use the British Airways name and livery.\nUnder the existing rules it would have been impossible to acquire or invest more than 50 percent in an airline in South Africa, said Ayling. \"South Africa is a part of the world which would not be open to us if we didn't have this deal,\" he said.\nAyling is visiting Australia to look at the operations of BA's 25 percent stake in Qantas, the national carrier.\nUnder the alliances with American Airlines and Qantas, BA and its partners fly to over 500 destinations in about 100 countries. Ayling said BA's global alliance could lead to opportunities in other parts of the world.  \n\"We may see, although this may be some way off, fleet acquisition opportunities, which would make a significant impact on procurement of aircraft,\" said Ayling.\n\"Once these agreements are put in place and they are being effectively managed, we will be able to see some things we are not able to see at the moment,\" he said.\nTwo weeks ago, BA reported an 11.1 percent rise in first quarter profits to 150 million sterling (US$231 million) on sales of 2.103 billion sterling. It forecast another record year in the year to March 1997.", "Australia's century-old steel maker, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), has been warned it risks falling behind global rivals unless it restructures its big, ageing plants and maps out a clear offshore strategy.\nBHP Steel's long-term strategy came under the spotlight on Monday after credit rating agency Standard and Poor's wrote in a steel industry review that BHP faced its toughest test yet as it positioned itself to tackle rapidly developing Asian markets.\nS&P's comments, made in the latest edition of its journal CreditFocus, comes as Taiwan's An Feng Steel Co Ltd plans to build a A$1.4 billion steel mill in Australia in what has been termed a \"wake-up call\" for BHP.\n\"A wake-up call is not a bad way of looking at it,\" a corporate analyst told Reuters, describing the competition to supply steel into Asian economies as intense.\n\"It's not that they (BHP) have been flat-footed; it's just that there are (bigger) global players out there with billions of dollars to set these things up,\" he added.\nAn Feng and its little known minority Australian partner, Kingstream Resources NL, launched last Friday a plan to build a new-technology steel mill expected to produce annually 2.4 million tonnes of steel slab for mainly Asian consumption.\nThe move has been seen as a direct challenge to BHP, which dominates the Australian market with steel products made from old-technology plants on the country's east and south coasts. The youngest of its three big steel mills opened 56 years ago. These old mills also supply raw steel for BHP's more modern offshore operations, which have so far focused on downstream steel mills in Asia making higher-value products tailored for such industries as car-making and construction.\nBHP produces 636 tonnes of steel per worker per year using predominantly coal-fired blast furnaces, but by the year 2000 new-technology mills using electric arc furnaces will enable steel operators to reach 1,000 tonnes per worker, S&P said.\n\"In many respects, BHP Steel's future earnings quality will depend on the successful implementation of this international growth strategy and the critical selection of steel-making technology for future domestic expansion,\" S&P analyst Brad Scott wrote in the January edition of CreditFocus.\nBHP is expected by May to announce the results of a year-long review of the steel division's long-term strategy, begun last year after the group reported a dive in steel profits and a big writedown of its Newcastle mill near Sydney.\nBHP has since indicated it is prepared to close the 81-year-old Newcastle mill if need be.\nSpeculation about the closure of Newcastle, and with it the loss of thousands of jobs, has prompted a parliamentary inquiry into the future of Australia's steel industry -- virtually a synonym for BHP, which supplies 75 percent of the local market.\nBHP's local dominance and its production costs, still low in global terms, will give it some comfort over the next few years, but the so-called \"Big Australian\" must rationalise its assets at home to realise its long-term goals in Asia, analysts said.\n\"BHP will need to define its domestic investment vision over that period or risk falling behind the competitiveness of its global competitors,\" S&P's Scott said.\nA stock analyst suggested BHP may even resolve to abandon raw-steel making capacity and begin buying it instead from cheaper producers, but a BHP Steel spokesman doubted this.\n\"I would not see that,\" spokesman John Devers told Reuters. \"We have got the benefits of relatively low-cost raw materials on our doorstep and good transport arrangements and energy.\"", "Wembley, England's home of soccer since the 1920s, will be the site of a new national stadium, the country's Sports Council announced on Tuesday.\nThe government-backed Council selected the north London venue ahead of the northern city of Manchester as the preferred location. Some 120 million pounds ($200 million) in National Lottery funding will be supplied to help turn the famous old stadium into a world class sports facility for the 21st century.\nWembley and Manchester were selected as the two leading candidates from five applicants last year. Sports Council chairman Sir Rodney Walker said that Wembley won out as it had greater potential to attract major international events.\nThe Sports Council has supported the English Football Association's bid to host soccer's World Cup in 2006 and the British Athletics Federation's attempts to attract the world championships in 2001.\nBut Manchester did not lose out completely as the Sports Council announced it had agreed in principle to provide up to 60 million pounds towards a new Stadium of the North to be used to host the Commonwealth Games in 2002, which have already been awarded to the city.\nIt said it would also consider backing Manchester council's bid for 20 million pound in funding for a new swimming and diving complex in the city, another Games facility.\n\"The Sports Council has agreed a 200 million package of financial support which will provide further opportunities for English and British sport to develop as a leading competitor on the world stage,\" Walker said.\nA competition is to be held to select an architectural firm to design the English National Stadium at the site owned by Wembley Plc.\nArchitect Sir Norman Foster has already unveiled his radical plans for an 80,000-seater stadium.\nIn his design, Wembley's famous twin towers would be repositioned to form a new gateway to the stadium area. The stadium would also be spun round 90 degrees with a new North/South axis.", "Thousands of demonstrators thronged Bogota's streets on Sunday calling for an end to the crime wave that has turned Colombia into the kidnap capital of the world.\nAt least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by the warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to event organisers.\nNational Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.\n\"When you're abducted, you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,\" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.\nSantos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.\nIn a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.\nThe women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.\nAn estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march. Organisers put the figure at twice that.\nNorberto Garcia, 62, tearfully watched the march and subsequent rally in the historic Plaza Bolivar square. Almost a year to the day his 14-year-old daughter Andrea disappeared on her way to school in a working-class district of the capital.\n\"When your child is kidnapped it is like your own life ends. It's the hardest thing for a parent to suffer,\" Garcia said.\nOnly last Wednesday, the country was rocked by the kidnap and murder of seven-year-old schoolboy Victor Alvarez in southwest Colombia. His corpse was dumped on the doorstep of his family home when his parents failed to pay a $10,000 ransom.\nBut in a country where even conservative estimates put the number of abductions at three a day, the tragedy of young Victor, of Papayan, was almost forgotten by Sunday.\nAnti-kidnap czar Alberto Villamizar was jeered by crowds as he delivered a message from President Ernesto Samper pledging to crack down on kidnapping.\nThe catcalls were preceded by chants of \"Serrano will save the motherland\", in support of the no-nonsense chief of National Police, who heads the fight against kidnapping and drug-trafficking.", "For managers at the trendy specialty juicer Odwalla Inc., the revelation that their apple juice products were associated with a potentially deadly outbreak of E. coli food poisoning has come as a shock.\nThe company, headquartered in the easy-going coast community of Half Moon Bay, was founded 16 years ago on the premise that fresh, natural fruit juices nourish the spirit.\nCompany executives were morose as they met reporters for the first time on Thursday in the parking lot of the company's modest building, across a creek from the town center.\n\"It is very tough, to be honest, to be focused on health and nutrition all of your life and have this incident happen,\" Greg Steltenpohl said. He founded the business with a childhood friend in Santa Cruz in 1980, using a used juicing machine in a shed behind their house.\nOdwalla has grown by more than 40 percent a year, with annual sales in its fiscal year to Aug. 31, 1996, surging 65 percent to $59.2 million. It is now estimated to account for more than 70 percent of the fresh-juice market in the seven Western states it serves, together with Vancouver, British Columbia.\nThe company prides itself on using cold processing, which it says leaves vegetable and other biological nutrients intact, and on a rapid store distribution system. Its marketing emphasizes freshness and the absence of pasteurization and artificial additives or preservatives.\nEven its name, from a song poem by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, displays a sense of mission. The Odwalla is a leader who guided the \"lost people of the sun\" out of the \"gray haze\" -- of \"overprocessed foods\" in this case.\nSteltenpohl and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Williamson said Odwalla had mobilized its 175 trucks and drivers, armed with hand-held computers, to recover recalled bottles from the shelves of more than 4,600 outlets in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Vancouver.\nExecutives immediately offered to refund the purchase price of any of the company's drinks, even those not among the 16 out of 23 fruit varieties recalled. They also said the company would pay for medical treatment for anyone found to have become ill through drinking an Odwalla product.\nAlthough Williamson said the company had product liability insurance that he believed would cover the incident, the executives declined to answer questions about the financial impact of the recall and any subsequent actions.\nOdwalla shares were up $1.13 at $13.25 by Friday afternoon after shedding roughly a third of their value on Thursday.\nJean-Michel Valette, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said publicity surrounding the recall would hurt sales but with insurance and $14 million in cash, \"Odwalla has the resources to weather the storm.\"\nOdwalla, which takes the precaution of keeping samples of each batch of juice it produces, is working with the Food and Drug Administration and Washington state authorities to determine how contamination might have occurred and how widespread it was.\nBut company officials said it was too soon to question their philosophy.", "Hong Kong business groups hit back on Wednesday at attempts to link China's permanent most favoured nation (MFN) trading perks with how Beijing handles Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control later this year.\nU.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe, leading a 22-member delegation from the House of Representatives to Beijing, said on Tuesday the United States will probably want to monitor Hong Kong for at least a year before granting China permanent MFN status.\n\"If MFN were conditioned or taken away, especially during the transition period, it would clearly have a devastating effect and make it much more likely that all the things we want for Hong Kong would not be achieved,\" said Mark Michelson, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.\nChina currently enjoys MFN, subject to annual review.\nHong Kong, which depends heavily on China-U.S. trade, fully supports China's application for full MFN status, which would allow China the same treatment as other big U.S. trading partners without the annual review.\n\"MFN should be the norm rather than a favour,\" said Selina Yen at the Hong Kong government's trade and industry branch.\n\"To us, MFN status is not a privilege. It should be granted to everybody as a normal trading basis. This is our position.\"\nBut few in Hong Kong expect to see China win full MFN status in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.\n\"It's unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,\" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.\n\"But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.\"\nLegislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.\nChina, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.\nPolitical analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.\n\"Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,\" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.\n\"But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.\"\nChina's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.\nHowever, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.\nU.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.", "Colombian police said on Sunday they discovered a second multimillion-dollar drug stash aboard a yacht owned by three Britons being held on cocaine smuggling charges stemming from a bust on the yacht in December.\nThe three men Michael Hayne, 50, of Egham, Surrey, his son Stephen Alan Hayne, 27, of Ashford, Kent, and David Maurice Shaw, 49, of Oldham, Lancashire, were arrested on Dec. 13 in the Caribbean coast port of Barranquilla and were being held on cocaine smuggling charges.\nAt the time, officials of the state security force DAS discovered more than 425 pounds (194 kg) of highly pure cocaine aboard their U.S.-registered boat Perla del Mar (Sea Pearl). In a more exhaustive search, conducted over the weekend, police turned up another 326 pounds (148 kg) of cocaine -- stowed away in the vessel's waste water tanks.\nA DAS chief estimated the street value of the first haul at $50 million. Police declined on Sunday to speculate on the overall value of the illicit consignment.\n\"The drugs were coated with a mixture of burned oil and coffee, which masks the smell and makes it more difficult for sniffer dogs to detect,\" a Barranquilla police spokesman said.\nThe Britons were being held in custody in Barranquilla's El Modelo jail. They could not be contacted on Sunday.\nIn a phone conversation in December, Michael Hayne told Reuters the situation had been a \"huge mix-up\" and hoped everything would be \"straightened out soon.\"\nDAS officials said Hayne, whose passport was issued by the British Embassy in Spain, and his son had entered Colombia illegally from Venezuela. Shaw entered Colombia legally -- his passport had been issued by the British High Commission in Trinidad.\nA spokeswoman for the regional prosecutor's office said the men could face between four and 12 years behind bars if convicted of the smuggling charges.\nColombian laws on drug trafficking are frequently seen as lax compared to standards in Britain and the United States.\nThe country's cocaine kings Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, heads of the once-mighty Cali drug cartel were sentenced 10 days ago.", "Microsoft Corp.'s share price rose to record levels Monday despite a warning by the software giant of slowing growth in fiscal 1998.\nMicrosoft, which reported \"blowout\" second-quarter results on Friday, closed at $90.75, up $3.625, and sparked a broad rally on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue, with more than 18 million shares changing hands.\nAfter the market closed Friday,the company reported second-quarter earnings equal to 57 cents a share, up from 45 cents a year earlier and easily surpassing a consensus estimate of 51 cents.\n\"They had a great quarter,\" said Frank Michnoff of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. \"(And) the outlook for the next two quarters looks very good; they said so themselves -- uncharacteristically.\"\nMore characteristic were comments by Microsoft executives in the earnings statement and a conference call with analysts afterward; they warned of a slowdown in growth in fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.\nMicrosoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown even went so far as to question the high valuation of the company's stock.\nIn a comment worthy of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Brown said Microsoft's high price-to-earnings multiple was a \"cause for curiosity.\"\nBut while Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock to hold from buy, based on its 100 percent increase over the past year, few investors heeded the warning.\n\"They do that every year,\" Michnoff said, referring to Microsoft's conservative forecasts. \"It's a bit like the boy who cried wolf. People are just not believing it.\"\nMost analysts who follow Microsoft raised their earnings estimates for the company.\nFirst Call, which tracks estimates, said a consensus of 19 analysts was that the Redmond, Wash.-based company would earn $2.33 a share for fiscal 1997, ending June 30, up from a previous consensus was $2.07. The company earned $1.72 a share in fiscal 1996.\nFor fiscal 1998, analysts see the company earning $2.71 a share, up from a previous consensus of $2.48.\nAnalysts say fiscal 1998 will be a year of tough comparisons for Microsoft after the 1995 introduction of the Windows 95 operating system, last year's upgrade of Windows NT and this year's launch of the Office 97 application upgrade.\nWhile Microsoft plans an upgrade to Windows 95 more tightly integrated with its Internet browser, it is unlikely to derive the benefits of another price increase or significant further operating cost reductions, analysts said.\n\"I think that Microsoft does have a lot of hurdles to get over,\" said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities, who calls the stock \"fairly valued\" at its current level of more than 30 times fiscal 1998 earnings.\nBut analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie said investors are happy to pay a premium for a company that dominates one of the biggest growth industries and consistently surpasses Wall Street expectations.\n\"They've delivered consistent earnings, and Wall Street hates ugly surprises,\" he said.\nDavid Readerman of Montgomery Securities said Microsoft would like to slow the meteoric rise in its stock price, if only to meet the challenge of providing enough shares to fulfil employee stock options.\n\"Yet it's difficult, with such a compelling long-term growth story, to keep a great stock down,\" he said.", "North America's largest gold producer, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp, reported lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs.\n\"I think their quarter clearly underscores that Barrick has made the transition from a growth company to one that's trying to maintain its existing base,\" said mining analyst Barry Allan of Gordon Capital.  \nBarrick's net income for the quarter fell to US$21 million, or US$0.06 a share, from US$67.7 million, or US$0.19 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.\nEarnings were slightly below analysts' expectations.\nBarrick pointed to higher cash costs, which rose to US$203 an ounce from US$194 an ounce a year earlier.\nThe company also took a US$38 million hit to bail out of its Cerro Corona exploration project in Peru.\nAnd Barrick hiked its exploration budget more than 50 percent, to US$46.4 million for the first nine months of the year, compared to US$30.9 million previously.  \nInvestors seemed to shrug that off. Barrick's shares rose C$0.50 to C$36.15 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock rose 3/8 to US$26 7/8.\nThe market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.\nBarrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its US$800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.  \nBarrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below US$100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.\nCapital costs should be about US$200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.\n\"They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,\" analyst Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.\nAt Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totaling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of US$240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about US$475 million.", "Ford Motor Company Ltd, the U.S. carmaker's U.K. arm, said on Tuesday that the British sales outlook for 1997 looked pretty flat as customers suffered from a \"feeling-not-so-good\" factor.\nIan McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford U.K., told Reuters in an interview at the British International Motor Show that weak sentiment was the primary reason for sluggish interest among UK consumers in the last three years.\n\"People were badly bitten by the recession and have become cautious about their own personal balance sheets,\" he said.\nHe added that it would require an end to consumer worries, like house owners' negative equity, and a cure for the recessionary hangover before the private car market took off.\nIndustry analysts have said that most of the growth in the UK car market has been due to companies buying cars, rather than the man on the street snapping up new models.\nMcAllister said company fleet sales would remain a priority for Ford in the coming year but said, \"We will reduce our exposure to the heavily discounted rental market.\"\nThe UK chief agreed that the slight growth in sales across the wider European car market so far in 1996 had been distorted by government incentives in countries like France to trade in fuel guzzling old cars for new models, as well as heavy discounting by most car makers.\nThe underlying picture for the European car industry has been less promising, he acknowleged, agreeing that excess market capacity in Europe had fuelled downward pressure on margins for players across the board.", "Toronto stocks ended softer on Monday after the important gold sector crumbled under the weight of falling bullion prices.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 31.70 points to 5984.97, below the 6000 level.

The committee also selected Tung to succeed Patten.\nTung has said the provisional legislature would soon hold its first meeting. However it will meet in China, not Hong Kong, in order to avoid a legal challenge by the colony's Democratic Party. The territory's biggest pro-democracy group says it is constitutionally illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.\nTung said he would try to persuade the Democrats to accept the provisional body during a meeting with them next Thursday. \"The provisional legislature has the right to exist.

The FCC \"tentatively concluded that the answer is no.\"\nLocal phone companies had pressed to have the access fee applied to Internet service companies.

People are having trouble with access and speed once they get on,\" he added.\nA senior official with Shanghai's Post and Telecommunications Bureau said there were no longer any restrictions on Chinese people signing up for Internet access.\n\"Some time ago, our security arrangements were incomplete and there was a problem with pornographic and politically unacceptable material,\" said the official, Zhang Weihua.\n\"But our arrangements have been improved and new accounts are being added without restriction,\" he added.\nZhang said there were a total of 3,200 registered Internet accounts on the Shanghai server at the end of August with the number increasing at several hundred a month.\nBut there are indications that several other organisations are selling Internet access and the real number of users is probably much higher, analysts said.\nChinese users going through the two main servers can access the World Wide Web and use e-mail, but the Internet's freewheeling discussion news groups are restricted.\nAnd while users are able to establish their own Web sites, they are not supposed to load the material onto the Web themselves, said an attendant at one of Shanghai's two new Internet Cafes.\n\"You must give us the files to allow for inspection and we will upload them for you,\" the attendant said.\nAnalysts said the main priority of the authorities at present seemed to be to control the number of lines through which the worldwide Internet material enters China to just two -- one in Beijing and one in Shanghai.\n\"There's is upposedly another line going through from (the southern city of) Guangzhou to Hong Kong, but for political reasons, Beijing wants to keep very tight control,\" said the computer expert.\n\"I think Beijing and Shanghai will continue to be the main filtering points because otherwise they can't filter it. If they have a lot of international links then you can forget about any kind of filtering,\" he added.\nThe question, he said, is whether the Chinese authorities can stay ahead of the ever-changing technology of the Internet and ahead of the ability of local computer whiz-kids to find ways round any barriers that are set up.\n\"Given the number of hackers in China, I would say there's no way in hell (they can stay ahead),\" the expert said. \"This is a country full of hackers. These guys have found so many holes in the (Chinese) servers it's ridiculous.\"\n\"The servers don't have the latest security equipment installed and these guys are brilliant.

Asia is a major focus, he added.\nHe declined to give details but said the Vietnamese opportunity involved an existing plant.\n\"There's nothing immediate but we are looking across all the areas of our business in fact,\" Ralph told reporters.\n\"We are involved in looking at a couple of opportunities, but it's early days. Provided we can see it makes sense for us, and we can do it on a basis that's going to earn a satisfactory return, then we are likely to move,\" he said.\nFoster's, which has breweries in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong in China, said the Chinese operations would break even or turn a profit in 1998/99. Foster's China posted a 1995/96 loss of A$17 million (US$13 million) before interest and tax.\nThe group's 40-percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, also performed weakly in its business year ending April 1, but has undergone a major restructure and is focusing on building market share at home, Foster's said.\nFoster's chief executive Kunkel said Molson still delivered a high return on invested capital and forecast higher operating profits from the group's powerhouse Australian brewing unit, Carlton and United Breweries, over the medium term.\nFoster's also plans to free up about A$400 million in non-performing assets and is counting on higher returns from its British pub chain, the Inntrepreneur Pub Company Ltd, putting the group in a stong position to pursue growth, Kunkel said.\nKunkel identified Asia as the most attractive region for investment, noting beer volumes there surged 60 percent in the first half of the 1990s and were forecast to rise another 40 percent before the turn of the century.\n\"Access can be achieved at a sufficiently low cost and the return profile is sufficiently better therefore than in other growing markets such as South America,\" he said.\nFoster's has allocated A$200 million for direct investments in Asian markets, deeming this amount a \"prudent exposure\".\nThe group has spent four years shedding unwanted assets, lightening the burden of debt accumulated in the 1980s when it was part of the sprawling conglomerate known as Elders-IXL Ltd.\nFoster's sold its British brewing unit, Courage, last year as part of this asset-sale programme. It has since bought two Australian wine-makers, Mildara Blass and Rothbury Wines Ltd.\n\"The restructuring of the last four years is nearly over,\" he said. \"Where there is more, it will present opportunities for profit.\"\nFoster's is on track to better its 1995/96 net profit of A$293.3 million in 1996/97, despite higher interest charges and tax payments in the current year, chairman Ralph said.", "Macromedia Inc. shares plunged to a two-year low Friday after the software company reported an unexpected third-quarter loss and said it could face weak sales for another quarter.\nSome analysts said they also were concerned that Apple Computer Inc.'s declining sales could hurt Macromedia's revenue from sale of software for Macintosh computers in coming quarters.\nShares of the San Francisco graphics software vendor fell $4.19, or 31 percent, to $9.31 in Nasdaq trading -- the lowest price since December 1994.\nMacromedia on Thursday reported a loss of $2.36 million, or 6 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with net income of $7.15 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Third-quarter revenue fell 9 percent to $28.1 million from $30.9 million.\nWall Street expected Macromedia to report net income of 14 cents a share, according to a recent survey of analysts by First Call.\nMacromedia gets about half its revenue from Director, a computer program that helps graphic artists make animated clips for video games and multimedia software.\nMacromedia customers are putting off Director purchases until the company releases a new version in a couple of months, analysts said.\n\"We are left with the concern that there will be a dip in revenue\" in the fourth quarter as well, said Kevane Wong, analyst at brokerage firm Jefferies & Co. in San Francisco.\nMacromedia also gets about 60 percent of its revenue from Macintosh software sales. A slow rollout of high-end Macintosh PCs in Europe led to slow European sales for Macromedia as well, said Ed Bierdeman, analyst at Dakin Securities.\n\"The Mac market is like a block of ice melting in the sun,\" leaving many Mac software vendors, including Macromedia, to suffer, Bierdeman said.\nMacromedia likely will post a small loss in its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in March, Bierdeman said.\nSeveral analysts also said they were concerned Macromedia might not be able to finish the new version of Director until spring, which would jeopordize earnings until the quarter ended in June.\nMacromedia officials could not be reached for comment immediately.", "Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists are turning into political sharks, spending millions of dollars to defeat a California ballot measure that they claim threatens American capitalism and could send stock prices reeling.\nNormally the region, which is the birthplace of such industry stalwarts as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Intel Corp., is more obsessed with Internet software tools and microchips than with politics.\nBut so widespread is the fear that California's Proposition 211 could make the state a haven for shareholder lawsuits that once politically neutral executives have been jolted into action -- hanging anti-211 banners on buildings and encouraging employees to vote against the initiative.\nProposition 211 is a far-reaching measure that would eliminate certain safeguards and immunity currently given corporate officers and staff members. For instance, it would hold them liable if they made projections about future results and they turned out to be wrong.\nOpponents of the measure fear that corporate officers would stop making any projections about how their business was doing, making it more difficult to make investment decisions and leading to a decline in share prices.\nProponents argue it will help victims of fraud recover losses. Opponents charge it is an \"insidious\" bid by securities lawyers to line their own pockets.\nThere were signs the campaign against 211 could affect the outcome. A Los Angeles Times poll published Friday found 52 percent of likely voters now oppose it, up 10 percentage points from a similar Times poll five weeks ago.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has urged California voters to reject the measure, warning it would use the state's legal system to roll back the federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed last year.\n\"California state courts could become a magnet for class action suits,\" he wrote in a letter of opposition.\nBoth President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential rival Bob Dole have come out against the measure and a recent study said its passage could result in a loss of up to 1.8 million jobs and a $102 billion drop in U.S. domestic output.\nThe study, by trade economist Clyde Prestowitz, also projected a subsequent rise in \"frivolous lawsuits\" could result in as much as a 24 percent drop in stock market prices.\nThis, he concluded, \"would far outweigh the 4 cents per dollar compensation, or less, that shareholders would receive from settlements and judgments\" under the measure.\nHigh-tech companies are considered more vulnerable to shareholder suits because their stocks typically are owned by demanding investors seeking fastest-growing companies, which can make their stock prices more volatile.\nA recent survey by the American Electronics Association of its members found nearly half would consider leaving the state if 211 passes. Some economists estimated it would eliminate 150,000 jobs and cost $1.3 billion in California alone.\nEven companies outside California, like International Business Machines Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. have opposed the measure, concerned that a single California shareholder could bring suit against them.\nIf it passes, high tech leaders like venture capitalist John Doerr, who is leading the $30 million-plus battle against 211, and Cypress Semiconductor Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers, have said they expect outside company directors to quit.\n\"If it passes, my net worth, my house, will be on the line,\" Rodgers said at a recent public debate on the issue here. \"It's a sleazy trick,\" he added.\nProponents of 211, including lawyers who bring shareholder lawsuits and stand to benefit directly from it, said they drew up the measure after a business-led initiative in the spring was opposed by nearly 60 percent of California voters.\n\"Americans are disgusted by corporate greed,\" said Richard Alexander, an attorney speaking in favour of the measure recently. \"People are angry about massive layoffs.\"\nBut in Northern California, where high tech businesses have thrived, executives said the proposition was more geared to forcing corporations to settle shareholder suits up front.", "Chrysler Corp. said Monday it rode strong sales of its pickup trucks, minivans and sport/utility vehicles to a 92 percent jump in third-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street's optimistic forecasts.\nDetroit's No. 3 automaker earned $680 million, or 93 cents a share, in the July-September period, setting records for both net income and earnings per share for the third quarter.\nA year earlier, when Chrysler was struggling through the slow production launch of its current-generation minivans, the company earned just $354 million, or 45 cents a share.\n\"Chrysler's performance in the third quarter was outstanding,\" Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. \"It was fuelled by record-setting demand for our products, which led to a new third-quarter U.S. retail unit sales record and produced the best model year for U.S. retail unit sales in the company's history.\"\nThe results included an after-tax charge of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme. About 531 salaried employees opted to leave the company under the programme during the quarter.\nExcluding the charge, Chrysler earned $735 million, or $1 a share, from operations, solidly exceeding Wall Street estimates. According to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, analysts had expected Chrysler to earn about $520 million, or 71 cents a share.\nChrysler shares jumped $1 to $32.75 after touching $33 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"I think it was all in the sales mix,\" Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said of Chrysler's strong performance. \"They've raised prices and the mix has shifted to trucks. They're selling not so many Neons and a lot more Jeep Grand Cherokees and Town & Country minivans.\"\nIndeed, light trucks -- which typically carry higher profit margins than passenger cars -- made up 66 percent of Chrysler's sales mix, versus 62 percent in the 1995 quarter. The automaker had full availability of its new minivans, and a St. Louis plant that had just started building Dodge Ram pickup trucks in August 1995 is now churning the vehicles out.\nChrysler earned a profit of $982 on each vehicle in the quarter, almost double the $492 earned per vehicle a year earlier. Incentive spending fell to $685 per vehicle from $870 a year ago, but was up from $625 in the second quarter.\nChrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade said he expected similar conditions in the fourth quarter, and added that Chrysler next year plans another big increase in truck-building capacity.\nHe told reporters on a conference call that the automaker will be able to build 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996, including the launch of a new Dodge sport/utility vehicle at Chrysler's Newark, Del., plant.\nThe four-door vehicle is expected to be based on the new Dodge Dakota pickup truck that Chrysler is launching and will give Dodge dealers their first sport/utility vehicle since the two-door Ram Charger was discontinued in 1993.\nValade said Chrysler will end the year with about 16.2 percent of the North American car and light truck market, but cautioned the company will be prudent when adding capacity.\n\"We don't feel ourselves share constrained at this 16 percent share level, but neither are we hell-bent to get to 20 (percent) at any cost,\" he said.\nSales climbed to $14.4 billion, a third-quarter record and up 20 percent from $12.0 billion in the 1995 quarter.\nThe automaker said it shipped 650,529 cars and trucks, up from 581,853 in the year-ago period, boosting its share of the combined U.S. and Canadian retail car and truck market to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the third quarter of 1995.\nIn the international market, Chrysler's retail sales were 57,209 vehicles, up 19 percent over the 48,207 vehicles it sold in the third quarter of 1995.\nIn Europe, Chrysler vehicle sales rose 28 percent.\nThe automaker said it bought back $452 million of its common stock in the quarter, bringing the total for 1996 to $1.6 billion, out of a $2 billion programme. The company bought back $1 billion worth of stock in 1995 and under its five-year peace accord with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, has pledged to buy back another $1 billion in 1997.\nFor the nine months, earnings were $2.72 billion, or $3.65 a share, nearly triple the $985 million, or $1.28 a share, in the first nine months of 1995.", "Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) is about to buy two new Airbus Industrie consortium aircraft and lease another to cope with increasing demand on its routes into China, industry sources told Reuters.\nThe proposed deal is for two new Airbus A320 aircraft for delivery in 1998 and 1999 with options for five more and one larger Airbus A330 on lease from next year, the source said.\nA Dragonair spokesman said it could not confirm the reported acquisition but he said talks on new aircraft had been taking place.\nThe airline which currently has a fleet of seven Airbus A320s and four A330s, recently said it will need additional aircraft.\n\"It is common knowledge that we have a requirement for extra capacity and we have been talking to Airbus but no announcement has been made yet,\" the spokesman said.\nIndustry analysts said expansion would be seen as a vote of confidence in future business prospects after a difficult period trying to develop its regional network especially into China.\nSlot restrictions at Hong Kong's crowded Kai Tak airport were a major constraint, they added.\nExpansion would also benefit Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd which holds an 18 percent stake in the regional carrier by feeding more passengers and cargo on its international network and vice versa, analysts said.\nDragonair recently began new services to the Chinese city of Qingdao and Khaohsiung in Taiwan. It also has full scheduled cargo rights on two of its Chinese routes to Xian and Chengdu and says it has plans for additional Chinese services to Chongqing, Urumqi and Shantou.", "Quaker Oats Co. is looking to shed its Snapple beverage business and, in the process, may also end up selling the Gatorade sports drink line, its single largest brand, analysts said Friday.\n\"I think it's up for sale,\" Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin said of Quaker's beverage division.\nSpeculation that Quaker may get rid of Snapple, which has posted operating losses since it was purchased for $1.8 billion two years ago, boosted Quaker's stock, which gained $1.50 to $37.50 in early afternoon trading on on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"We've been saying since this summer that there was a high probability that Quaker would pursue a restructuring, and beyond just Snapple,\" CS First Boston analyst Michael Mauboussin said.\nHe said that a possible restructuring at Quaker likely would include selling some assets, which Mauboussin said were currently under-valued.\n\"Gatorade being the crown jewel, clearly,\" he added.\nRumors regarding an outright purchase of Quaker or various parts of its businesses have swirled around the Chicago-based company for about three years. Quaker has consistently declined to comment on any speculation.\n\"I will simply tell you that it is our policy not to comment on rumors and speculation,\" Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said Friday.\nThe speculation gained credibility, analysts said, when the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Quaker might sell Gatorade and Snapple, with prices quoted between $3 billion and $4 billion.\n\"I would have said (the chance of Quaker selling its beverage business was) less than 50-50 before I read the article,\" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. \"But I think if somebody offers them $4 billion.... they have to take it.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal said the most likely buyers for Quaker's beverage business were said to be Procter & Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc..\nPepsiCo also declined to comment.\n\"We have a long standing policy of not commenting on rumors,\" said Richard Detwiler, director of public relations for PepsiCo.\nIf Quaker sold its beverage businesses, its food businesses, including oatmeal, ready-to-eat cereal and pasta and rice dishes, could also attract buyers, analysts said.\nThe Wall Street Journal said Philip Morris Cos. Inc. might be interested in buying some of Quaker's food brands to bolster its Kraft Foods operation.\nA Kraft spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.\nIt had been widely anticipated that Quaker would scale back Snapple to a regional brand, spin it off or sell it.\nQuaker management, however, said earlier this year that Snapple's fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business would remain a national brand.\n\"What he (Chairman William Smithburg) has been saying does not indicate that he is looking to sell the business right now,\" O'Neil of BT Securities said. \"But he always comments that he will act to increase shareholder value.\"\nSmith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said selling off Quaker's businesses may yield the highest return to shareholders on a short-term basis. But \"it doesn't have to happen,\" Rabinowitz said.\nAnalysts have said previously that they expected Quaker to write off additional goodwill for Snapple, which would be a non-cash charge.\nThe company said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will review Snapple for a possible charge to reduce its carrying value.", "The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Thursday to lift a lower court suspension of landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation's local telephone monopolies to competition.\nThe department, acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, said the lower court's \"stay\"  could hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of full-fledged competition in the $100 billion market.\nThe request comes after a U.S. appeals court based in St. Louis last week suspended key provisions of the FCC's \"interconnection\" order, which spells out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others could operate in the local phone market under the new telecommunications law.\nThe rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned.\nThey argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent.\nThe three-judge appeals court panel said the opponents \"have a better than even chance of convincing the court\" that the FCC's rules conflicted with the law.\nBut the Justice Department told the high court the appeals court action \"already imperils\" the timetable set by Congress for opening the local phone market.\n\"The stay draws into question not just the timing of competition in the local market, but also the timing of full entry by the Bell companies into the long-distance telephone market,\" the department added.\nLong-distance carriers AT&T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay.\nLawyers were divided over the likely outcome.\n\"They have a decent shot at lifting the stay,\" said Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. He noted the FCC's success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.\nBut others were less sure. \"It's very difficult to predict,\" said Nicholas Allard of Latham & Watkins.\nThe Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.\nThomas could refer the request to the full court for its consideration.", "French President Jacques Chirac looked set on Wednesday to achieve his ambition of creating a national defence giant to rival huge U.S. conglomerates through the planned merger of Lagardere's Matra with Thomson- CSF.\nThe government announced on Wednesday it preferred a bid by missile-maker Lagardere Groupe for electronics firm Thomson SA over a rival one by civilian engineering group Alcatel Alsthom. Both offers have been referred to the independent Privatisation Commission.\nThe preference for Lagardere seems to vindicates the integration sought by Noel Forgeard, chairman of Lagardere's Matra unit, who has fought a highly-public campaign for Thomson, in order to win its Thomson-CSF defence arm.\nThe deal will \"indisputably strengthen the missiles activity in France and particularly Europe,\" said Jean-Marc Baron, a partner specialising in defence at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. \"The merger wil create a critical mass,\" he added.\nMatra specialises in air-to-air missiles with the Magic and Mica weapons, while Thomson-CSF has ground-to-air missiles including the Crotale NG (New Generation) and Starstreak very- short-range missile built with Shorts Brothers Plc, a unit of Canada's Bombardier.\nThe addition of Thomson-CSF reinforces a vital joint venture between Matra and British Aerospace Plc to create Matra BAe Dynamics, which Lagardere wants to be the pole for future European industrial concentration.\nBesides the missile synergy, Baron pointed to the benefits of marrying Thomson-CSF's radar and communications expertise with Matra's space satellites, which will give Thomson access to a new market.\nLagardere has major space interests with its Matra Marconi Space (MMS) joint venture with GEC Plc of Britain and also wants to use this a platform for building a single European satellite giant, to make the most of scarce funds.\nThis vertical integration of detection, communications and weapons makes the future Thomson Matra a powerful \"systems\" player rather than a seller of separate products. Each of these segments has annual turnover of about $1-$2 billion, Baron said.\nIn the United States, the defence industry has quickly consolidated through $40 billion of mergers and acquisitions to create giants such as Lockheed Martin. Integration is seen as key, with firms such as Hughes, a unit of General Motors, not only building missiles and satellites but also operating the satellites.\nEuropean and U.S. defence firms have had to adapt to shrinking military spending since the end of the Cold War and soaring research and development costs. But Europe has lagged in that restructuring due to differing national interests.\nWith the aid of Matra's links with BAe and GEC and through overtures to Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), Forgeard wants to forge a European grouping which would have world class status in terms of turnover and product range.\nChirac launched the privatisation of Thomson SA in February as part of a restructuring of France's fragmented defence industry, widely seen by analysts as a vital step toward a badly needed consolidation of European capacity.", "Abbey National on Monday called for Scottish Amicable to put on hold proposals to drop its mutual status and allow policyholders time to consider last week's offer for the life assurance group.\nBut ScotAm were quick to reject the demand together with renewed requests by Abbey for access to its books.\nScotAm said it had no intention of altering its plans and would proceed according to its own timetable and not one dictated by Abbey.\n\"They're asking for privileged access to information before policyholders,\" said a ScotAm spokesman.\n\"The policyholders have to get that information, see the detail of what we're offering and at that time Abbey can make a proper judgement of its offer.\"\nThe details of ScotAm's demutualisation and flotation plans are due to be published at the beginning of next week.\nUntil then an impasse looks likely with ScotAm refusing to discuss Abbey's approach and Abbey prevented from seeing more detailed financial information it says it needs.\nIt argues that policyholders should have the opportunity to compare ScotAm's plans with alternative offers based on the same information.\n\"Ours is a firm offer based on published information and it is a minimum offer. If we had the information they have, we'd be on the same level playing field,\" said an Abbey spokesman.\n\"The policyholders should be given the chance to vote on the best deal on the table. If Scottish know there's a firm offer from us - and there may be other interested parties - they should consider all of these and put them to policyholders at one go.\"\nMany industry observers expect the move by Abbey which already owns Glasgow-based Scottish Mutual, to prompt an auction for ScotAm with interest anticipated from both Britain and overseas.\nInsurance group Prudential has said it was \"watching the situation with interest\" and has made no secret that it is on the lookout for an acquisition in the life assuarnce sector.\nBritain's Halifax building society, high street banking group National Westminster, Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services company, and Dutch firm ING Groep have all declined to comment on reports they might throw their hats in the ring.\nNo talks have been held with any other parties and according to the ScotAm, none are planned ahead of the publication of its proposals. For the time being at least, the company remains dismissive of Abbey's approach.\nIt has repeatedly attacked what it describes as the \"vagueness\" of Abbey's offer - a minimum of 400 million pounds ($641 million) and between 700 million and one billion pounds for the embedded value of the with-profits fund.\nBut the company was keen to stress that the interests of policyholders remained the most important consideration and if a suitable offer emerged it would be put to policyholders.\n\"The kite being flown by Abbey has all the superficial attractions of an upfront cash offer to policyholders without any assurance of the long term welfare of policies,\" ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart told Reuters.\n\"Abbey has said more to the press than it has put in writing to the board and that should alert policyholders that it's time for very careful reflection.\"", "Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group's net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96.\nBut it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business.\nSimsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.  \n\"Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations,\" Crabb said.\nHe later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago.\n\"It will be lower for the full year,\" Crabb said.  \nSimsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling.\nIn mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million.\nCrabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement.\n\"Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997),\" he said.  \n\"We can't see too much on the horizon at this time,\" he said.\nCrabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements.\n\"It's in the U.K. For us it will be quite large,\" he said.\n\"We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we've got a good broad coverage,\" he said.\n\"We'll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We've got no problems funding it.\"  \nHe said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand.\n\"I guess we'd only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment.\"\nSimsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million.\nEarlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd's Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.  \nCrabb said Simsmetal supplies most of its products to BHP's Sydney mini-mill and its Port Kembla plant, south of Sydney.\n\"Maybe it will make life easier for us because we will be able to buy more scrap,\" Crabb said, responding to a shareholders question.\nSimsmetal's shares were up one cent at A$6.89 at 2.40 p.m. (0340 GMT).", "Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s Chairman Dwayne Andreas apologised to shareholders Thursday for the \"difficult situations\" that the company faced over the past year.\nAndreas, like other ADM officials who spoke at the meeting, used mostly euphemisms when referring to ADM's guilty pleas to two counts of pricing-fixing and an agreement to pay $100 million in fines to the U.S. government.\n\"I acknowledge to you that this occurred on my watch as chairman of your company,\" Andreas told shareholders at the annual meeting here. \"You have my apology and my commitment that things are arranged so that this will never happen again.\"\nA proposal requiring the board be composed of a majority of independent directors was defeated, but received 42 percent of the votes cast.\nOther shareholder proposals addressing corporate governance issues did not pass.

Richard Reising, corporate secretary and general counsel, said the company did not consider it necessary given the amount of publicity the antitrust settlement received.\nADM board member Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada, told shareholders the \"consensual resolution\" with the Justice Department was reached after negotiations with the board's special committee of independent directors.\n\"This has been a terribly unfortunate experience for the company and we as a committee deeply deplore it,\" Mulroney said.\n\"It is our intention to ensure that the company learns from mistakes in the past and acts so that they never happen again,\" Mulroney said.\nHe referred to the investigation of ADM as a \"shadow\" that was cast on the future of the company.\n\"While some matters still await resolution, I am pleased to tell you today that we have begun to cast off that shadow and move the company forward into the future...,\" Mulroney said.", "Rains ended abruptly throughout most of Ivory Coast in the second 10 days of December, allowing crops to dry after the extended rain, upcountry buyers and weather analysts say.\nWeather data showed average rain down to 8mm from about 45 mm at the start of December, with little or no rain falling at six of eight stations monitored in the 10 days to December 20.\nA total of 65 mm fell compared to 400 mm at nine stations in the first 10 days of the month.

Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.\n\"Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can't be Dodge City without a sheriff,\" Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as \"the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that's ever been built.\"\nPSINet's Schrader countered that existing laws already protected movies, books and other works. \"Everything is not new,\" he said. \"It's the same-old, same-old.\"", "A furry hedgehog, idyllic sunsets and the meaner streets of Budapest seem unlikely moneyspinners, but such images are crowding Canada's airwaves as the annual mutual fund season kicks into gear.\nArmed with high-powered ad campaigns, eager fund sellers are vying for the billions of dollars Canadians will pour into registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs).\nWith interest rates at 40-year lows and stocks at stratospheric heights, investors are expected to shun interest-bearing investments for higher yielding mutual funds before the March 1 deadline for RRSP contributions.\n\"We're in the thick of it right now and it's going to get busier and busier toward the end of the (RRSP) season,\" said John Wiltshire, vice-president of marketing for Investors Group, Canada's top fund company with C$25 billion ($18 billion) in assets.\nTAX BENEFIT IS A DRAW\nCanada introduced RRSPs in the late 1950s to allow people without registered pension plans to save for retirement. Investors can deduct the amount from their taxes for the previous year's income.\nBesides being a tax benefit, RRSPs have become more popular as traditional pension benefits are scaled back.\nCanadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year.\nFund companies also expect a big chunk of the C$250 billion ($186 billion) currently invested in guaranteed investment certificates and term deposits to shift into funds.\nIn what has become an annual rite of the Canadian winter, fund sellers flood the airwaves with promotions, hype and gimmicks to lure RRSP dollars. But, unlike the United States, Canadian broadcast rules prohibit companies from making performance claims on television or radio.\n\"That's why you get fuzzy advertising. They talk about lifestyle and emphasise branding,\" said John Kaszel, director of research for Investment Funds Institute of Canada, a lobby group representing 40 fund companies.\nSoft-sell ads feature happy people in tranquil settings with simple messages such as \"We're here to get you there,\" or \"quietly creating wealth.\"\nNEXT GENERATION THE TARGET\nSome firms are targeting the next generation of investors.

The result, as far as radio and television are concerned, is a multimillion dollar river of non-information,\" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Terence Corcoran wrote recently.\nSCANDALS MAY MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS\nBut regulators are unlikely to relax their grip on the industry. In fact, the rules could tighten after recent scandals such as the Veronika Hirsch affair.\nHirsch was a star stock picker hired last summer to spearhead Boston-based Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market. But she was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company.\nFidelity also offered clients their money back without penalty. \"We were pleased that the number of people who did take advantage of it was less than our expectation,\" said spokesman Chethan Lakshman, but he did not give any numbers.\nHirsch's True North Equity Fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$211 million ($156 million) in assets since its launch last September.\nHirsch's status was under discussion, Lakshman said, but a separation package was rumoured to be under negotiation.\nFALLOUT PROMPTS GUIDELINES REVIEW\nThe fallout from the Hirsch affair prompted a review of the industry's guidlines for fund managers. \"It has opened up some concerns, but those are being addressed. Now we are seeing whether more should be done,\" Kaszel said.\nWhile analysts said it was difficult to assess the damage to the industry's credibility, the Hirsch affair changed how companies sell their product.\nBrash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the \"team\" is in, analysts said.\nCanada's Big Six banks are also heavy advertisers this year as they strive to become bigger players in a industry dominated by independents.\nThree banks are now among the top 10 firms, with Royal Bank of Canada number three behind Investors Group amd Trimark Investment Management Inc.\nThe banks were allowed to enter the mutual fund business in 1987 and now account for 29 percent of the industry's assets.

That rate was much lower than market rates, the company said.\nIf there is a cashflow shortage to repay interest, it will be able to draw down on stabilisation notes, which are effectively a credit line, free of interest until January 2006.\nThe plan also pushed back the debt repayment periods by a significant period, Ponsolle said. The resettable bonds mature in 2050, the participating loan notes in 2040, the remaining junior debt in 2025 and stabilisation notes in 2026.\nEurotunnel has also negotiated the right to refinance all its debt after 2004, free of penalties, to benefit from any improvement in market conditions. Previously, that refinancing incurred heavy financial penalties.\nThe deal had been worked out using a wide range of scenarios and sought to preserve the company's future and independence, Ponsolle said. \"It is the best compromise under the circumstances. The sacrifices for shareholders and banks are equal and equitable.\"\nThe two chief aims of the deal were \"to preserve a clear majority for the shareholders and to ensure long-term financial stability,\" he said.\nAlthough the company planned to pay a first dividend in around 10 years, if it performed very well it could make a payment at the date envisaged in the 1994 rights issue -- 2004.\nAsked what would happen if shareholders rejected the deal, Ponsolle said, \"I think we would go back to the choices at the starting point. The starting point was either we come to a friendly agreement or insolvency.\"\n\"I think, contrary to some, an insolvency could only be a catastrophe for the small shareholders.\"\nPrices should rise \"to a reasonable level\" following the merger announcement last week of P&O and Stena of their cross-Channel operations, Ponsolle said.\nThe merger news had come as a surprise to Eurotunnel, which had not expected such a move until later, perhaps in 1997, he said.\nThe earliest Eurotunnel could hold a shareholders' meeting to vote on the deal would be late March or early April, he said.", "Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. are trying to forge an alliance to mine the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia despite a cloud of uncertainty over the rights to the find, Bre-X's chief executive said Thursday.\nBut the negotiations with Barrick are progressing slowly, Bre-X Chief Executive Officer David Walsh told Reuters.\n\"We're moving ahead, albeit at a snail's pace,\" he said, adding that legal issues stood in the way of a full agreement. \"We're trying to get them to appreciate our views and the legal stance that we've taken.\"\nLast month the Indonesian government advised Bre-X to form a joint venture with Toronto-based Barrick to operate Busang. The government, which also requested a 10 percent stake, set a Dec. 4 deadline, but the two companies announced after that date that several issues remained outstanding.\nSince then, the Indonesian government has raised doubts about Bre-X's grip on Busang, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold, worth about $21 billion at today's prices.\n\"The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,\" Umar Said, Indonesia's secretary-general of mines, told Reuters in Jakarta on Thursday. \"Therefore the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.\"\nHe said Bre-X and Barrick must jointly submit new applications for work on the deposit. Without contracts of work granted by the Indonesian government, Bre-X cannot proceed to exploit the find.\nWalsh defended his company, saying its permits and applications for the gold property were \"in good standing.\"\nHe said two Bre-X officials met with Umar in Jakarta Thursday and were assured everything was in line. \"The telephone call that I got from Rolie (Francisco), he was quite pleased with the meeting. He said we're making very good progress in our relationship (with the mines ministry),\" Walsh said.\nBre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty, explaining the apparent contradiction, said: \"What the government wants to do in essence is that if an agreement with Barrick is made, the existing applications will be replaced with new applications.\"\nBre-X earlier said that Umar had apologised for the misunderstanding, saying his comments were \"erroneously reported in a Dec. 11 Reuters newswire article.\" But Peter Thomas, a Reuter spokesman in London, said the international news and information company was confident the quotations in its Dec. 11 story from Jakarta were accurate.\nUmar's comments to Reuters Thursday were essentially repeating what he said on Wednesday.\nDespite a barrage of statements from Bre-X on Thursday, Barrick was still seeking clarification on the situation from the Indonesian government.\n\"We're still seeking clarification and we want to hear directly from the government of Indonesia,\" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in Toronto. \"We're not saying anything until we talk directly to the government of Indonesia.\"\nBre-X, too, is waiting for the Indonesian government to make a move.\nWalsh said he still had high hopes that Indonesian President Suharto would open up an auction for Busang, allowing other mining companies to bid on the project. He said Bre-X had not made a formal request for an auction, but added: \"We understand that the president is reviewing the situation.\"\nAn auction would be advantageous for Bre-X shareholders and for Indonesia, he said. \"We're not soliciting offers. We are getting other phone calls,\" Walsh said. \"I am talking to principals of other companies.\"\nHe said he had spoken to executives at Placer Dome Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp.\nIn Vancouver, Placer Dome spokesman Hugh Leggatt said any suggestion of an open auction on Busang was encouraging. His company has made a formal request for an open bidding process.\nBut gold mining analyst Bill Belovay of CIBC Wood Gundy said Barrick's competitors may be trying to make a deal with Bre-X more expensive for Barrick. \"They're playing games,\" he said. \"One has got to read between the lines.\"\nBelovay said Busang was so fraught with uncertainty that he has a hard time understanding why the major gold producers would be interested. \"One doesn't even know what percentage (Barrick) will end up with. One doesn't even know how to keep Suharto happy,\" he said. \"To me it's a whole big nightmare.\"\nInvestors were confused by Thursday's developments, analysts said.\nBre-X, whose stock was halted all day on Wednesday, fell 85 cents to C$19.80 in heavy trading of more than 8.6 million shares.

That reduces the equity cushion the company has available to show its creditors, Koenig said.\nBut analysts also said the company had about $1 billion in loans receivable on its books at the end of October, 1996 -- an asset to show creditors.\n\"No one has questioned the validity of the amount of receivables they have on their books or the quality of those receivables,\" Kmiotek said.\nAlso, Mercury has generally been well regarded in the sub-prime credit quality loan business, which could help it negotiate with its banks and continue as a going concern, said analysts and lawyers familiar with the company.\nMercury said in a statement it is in discussions with its lenders to satisfy working capital needs, but that it could not predict the outcome of those discussions.", "Electronic commerce over the Internet - buying airplane tickets, music CDs, or clothes with a credit card - is not fiction anymore.\nBut security and other concerns hampered the Internet from becoming an international shopping mall in 1996, and security remains an issue for 1997.\nElectronic commerce in 1996 was not quite as robust as some firms had anticipated, as delays in developing the software to secure credit card transactions on the Net kept merchants and consumers at bay. E-commerce is still in its infancy and likely to explode toward the end of the century.\n\"This was kind of a building year,\" said Scott Smith, a Jupiter Communications analyst. \"Many consumers are just starting to get online, merchants are trying to still figure out how to present themselves online.\"\nAccording to Jupiter, total revenues generated from all consumer shopping over the Internet and online services will reach about $1.2 billion in 1996. The revenues are expected to almost double next year, to $2.3 billion.\nJupiter, a New York market research firm, forecasts 1999 revenues to jump to $5.5 billion and to $7.3 billion in 2000.\nTravel and the direct distribution of electronic products, such as PCs, software, etc., are the two biggest categories of electronic commerce right now, Smith said, with travel making up about half of the $1.2 billion in 1996 commerce revenues.\nMost of the giant retailers are sitting by the sidelines, watching and waiting for the security to be in place and to see what some of the catalog merchants and other more daring retailers are doing on the Internet, where there are many opportunities to save costs, keep inventories low and target customers with specific products aimed at their profiles.\n\"It's inventing whole new ways of selling stuff,\" said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the head of International Business Machines Corp.'s Internet division.\nIBM has developed a shopping mall called World Avenue, where mostly speciality retailers have storefronts.It also includes Express, the popular unit of Limited Inc.\nBut still, Internet shopping is not viewed by consumers as completely safe. A recent study by O'Reilly & Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., reported that fewer than 1 percent of all public World Wide Web sites are fully able to host secure transactions.\n\"It's easy enough to know that if you get a warning from your browser that what you are about to do is dangerous...that this is a deterrant,\" said Richard Peck, a vice president at O'Reilly \"Commerce readiness is an issue of consumer trust, confidence.\"\nCredit card companies MasterCard International and Visa International have been working together since last February on software to secure credit card transactions, using data encryption (scrambling) techniques and authentication software to ensure identities of the consumer, the merchant and the Web site.\nBut the software development is behind, analysts and industry executives said, even though the protocols (the roadmap for software developers) called the SET (secure electronic transaction) specification have been published.\nThe companies had said in February they expected banks to be able to offer secure bankcard services via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter 1996.\n\"They have totally blown that deadline out of the water,\" Smith of Jupiter said. \"There was a bit of hype about it originally that made people think it would be done really fast.\" Smith said the development has many diverse layers.\n\"There are issues that have to be sorted out. It probably won't be until 1998 when it is fully implemented,\" Smith said.\nVisa did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for MasterCard in Purchase, N.Y. said that the companies remain \"on track\" with their original timeframes, but that MasterCard had no news since a recent announcement.\nLast month, MasterCard purchased 51 percent of Mondex International Inc., a leading electronic payment system using a payment card called a smart card, which are like electronic wallets. A group of banks and AT&T endorsed the electronic cash card, with pilot testing already going on in some cities.\nSmart cards will likely become one of the many ways consumers pay for purchases online. PCs will have built-in smart card readers, specifically designed for online buys.\nSo while the SET software is still in development, companies are finding other ways to do transactions.\nCyberCash, which is also a partner working on the SET transaction system, is providing encryption software for America Online Inc's Web hosting service, so that small or large companies selling goods can have a secure credit card payment system, based on data encryption software currently available.\n\"SET isn't really all there yet,\" said Doug McKee, manager of Web server development at AOL. \"Cybercash has a system that is like a proprietary version of SET...I don't think there is a reason to wait.\"\nSome companies are not waiting. While the big retail giants slowly enter cyberspace, a new breed of Internet retailers and brands are being born, like Amazon.com, the popular site bookseller and Onsale.com, an auction house for computers and consumer electronics goods.", "Monsanto Co said Monday its pending acquisition of Holden's Foundation Seeds, a $1.0 billion deal that gives it access to the worldwide seed corn market, will dilute earnings for two or three years.\nIn the first year, dilution could be as much as $0.10 to $0.17 a share, Filippello said, but cautioned the number could be lower than that due to pending accounting issues.\n\"But by the end of the decade, this will be accretive even from an accounting standpoint,\" Nicholas Filippello, chief economist for Monsanto, said in a telephone interview.  \nVariables in determining the amount of earnings dilution include charges Monsanto may take in the future related to the Holden's deal. Those charges may include write-offs of Holden's in-process research and development, which would reduce the amount of ongoing amortization from the deal.\nBased on Monsanto's benchmark of measuring itself on an \"economic value added\" (EVA) basis, the acquisition is positive for the company, Filippello added.\n\"We are willing to accept some near-term dilution in (earnings per share) from an accounting standpoint if in fact we are creating value in a net added value sense,\" he said.  \nEVA is derived by taking net income and subtracting a charge for the capital used to generate that income, Monsanto said in its 1995 annual report.\nEarlier, Monsanto said it will buy Holden's,  Corn States Hybrid Service Inc and  Corn States International for up to $1.02 billion.\nFilippello said Monsanto will pay up to $945.0 million for Holden's, which produces corn germplasm used by seed companies to create hybrid seeds. It will pay up to $75 million for Corn States and Corn States International, which are the exclusive worldwide marketing and sales representatives for Holden's.  \nBoth prices may later be reduced, Filippello added.\nAnalysts said Monsanto's acquisition of Holden's, which had been expected, is also a defensive move to block its competitors from gaining access to the seed company.\nNatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said he considers the planned acquisition of Holden's and Corn States \"a strategic positive\".\nBy buying Holden's, Monsanto gains an outlet for its genetic developments. Simply put, Monsanto can implant the genes it develops in the germplasm -- or parent seeds -- produced by Holden's.\nMonsanto said more than 35 percent of the approximately 80 million acres of corn planted in the United Sates use genetic material developed by Holden's.\nFilippello said the Corn States International acquisition also gives Monsanto access to some 300 million acres of corn worldwide.\nThe other positive for Monsanto is the ability to sell more of its flagship Roundup herbicide to farmers who plant genetically-enhanced seeds from Holden's. Monsanto has developed a gene that makes crops, like corn, resistant to use of its Roundup herbicide to kill weeds in the field.", "She once jokingly thought of calling her autobiography \"Fascist Bitch,\" and now Canadian journalists are wondering what epithet to use as she plays an expanding role in the country's largest newspaper empire.\nBritish-born Barbara Amiel, the wife of Hollinger Inc. chairman Conrad Black, is an accomplished journalist who counts many fans in Britain, where she writes a rightwing shoot-from-the-hip column for the Daily Telegraph, the centerpiece of the Hollinger empire.\nAlthough she honed her craft in Canada, she makes many Canadians bristle by standing out from the mass of generally liberal journalists. She says she has never managed to reap the accolades she desires from Canadians, the ones she routinely receives from the British.\nA sought-after London party guest, Amiel now is in the Canadian spotlight through her position as vice president of editorial in her husband's newspaper empire. Hollinger added a majority shareholding in Southam Inc., the country's largest daily newspaper chain, to its media stable, substantially boosting its control to more than 40 percent of the industry.\nThe move left some Canadians worried about Hollinger's influence on their media and many Southam journalists fearful for their jobs as Black's well-known road to profits often involves cutting newspaper staff.\nHUSBAND CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF\nAt a recent conference of journalists in Ottawa, Amiel, a former Toronto Sun editor, was repeatedly asked about Black's intentions. She replied that he could speak for himself. But she added, \"I think the Southam papers.... have not done their best but have terrific potential.\"\nAmiel, who still writes for Maclean's magazine, hesitated when asked if she was treated differently in Canada than abroad. \"I think Canada's been very good to me. I became editor of a newspaper, (former editor) Peter Newman gave me a column in Maclean's magazine, how many people have got that? You can't complain.\"\nBut then she added, \"I've never, although one always wants it, had the recognition of my peers that I've had in England, but then maybe I didn't deserve it in Canada.\"\nTelevision personality Alan Edmonds, an admirer of Amiel who disagrees with her views, said Canadians have refrained from praising Amiel's talents because of her rightwing bias. \"In the years that she was in Canada.... the prevailing mindset in the media was in the opposite direction.\"\nEdmonds said other journalists were jealous of the openings that came her way. \"She's used her undoubted feminine attraction to.... create opportunities to use her undoubted superior intellect.\"\nIn person and in print, Amiel has a knack for sparking debates. For instance, she once wrote that Quebec's moves toward independence, culminating in a narrow 1995 defeat for the separatists, could be blamed on Canada's liberal elite, which promoted multi-culturalism, thereby strengthening French-Canadian nationalism.\nCASTIGATING LEFTWINGERS\nHer columns have castigated Ontario's former leftwing government, led by the New Democratic Party, for allegedly being swayed by special interest groups like the disabled. She also wrote that Ontario, which gave homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, had weakened the family.\nCanada's most widely read satirical magazine, Frank, noted \"a favorite theme in her columns is the insidiousness of self-pity, that the poor should get on with their lives and quit carping about it.\" And columnist Allan Fotheringham once observed, \"Barbara Amiel, otherwise known as Mrs. Conrad Black, can take out any opponent in the world and eat them for breakfast. As she does regularly in print.\"\nAmiel has even joked about her reputation, saying she thought about calling her surprisingly frank 1980 autobiography \"Fascist Bitch,\" a name suggested by irate readers. Instead the book was titled \"Confessions.\"\nNow in her mid-50s, the much-married Amiel began her path at the tender age of eight at a \"grotty little newspaper\" in her hometown of Hendon, England. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried and her new Canadian stepfather dragged his new family back home. Amiel, used to fine surroundings, ended up in Hamilton, a gritty steel town in southern Ontario about 40 miles (70 km) from Toronto.\nBefore her 1991 marriage to Black, she was married to student Gary Smith, philosopher George Jonas and cable magnate David Graham, with whom she returned to England in 1985.\nIn 1993 well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood published \"The Robber Bride\" about a scapel-assisted femme fatale named Zenia. The Canadian rumor mill identified Amiel as the model for Zenia, but she denied it.", "Cable & Wireless Communications, a major new British cable operator formed on Tuesday from a group led by Cable & Wireless Plc, has the potential to be competitive and focuses attention on the fast-growing area, analysts said.\n\"The logic is irrefutable...the advantages of scope and size are undoubtedly there,\" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst John Tysoe.\nCable & Wireless, NYNEX Corp of the U.S. and Bell Canada International announced they would merge the operations of their British subsidiaries in a complex deal, culminating in a float of 15 percent of the new company.\n\"That creates an integrated second force, which will give BT a run for its money,\" Tysoe said, referring to telecommunications giant British Telecommunications.\nShares in Cable & Wireless closed up 25.5 pence to 466.5, after touching a high of 476.5 pence, while NYNEX Cable Communications gained 23.5 pence to 119.5 pence.\n\"It's a jolly bold and impressive move,\" said one sector analyst.\nThe merger should result in quite significant cost savings, said Chris McFadden of Merrill Lynch, including tax offsets, refinancing of high-yield cable television funding and possibly through staff cuts.\n\"The new company can offer the complete range of services and it will be competing with BT in the franchises which it operates,\" the sector analyst said.\nAnalysts added that the deal was expected to dilute earnings slightly in the first year but enhance them from year two.\nBT's shares edged down four pence to 354 pence as the market weighed the emergence of a new competitor.\nBut BT welcomed the consolidation in the sector, saying it would create a market \"where competition can become the natural regulator.\"\nAnalysts said BT's calls to be allowed to provide cable television, which the Conservative government has so far rebuffed, could gain impetus from the emergence of Cable & Wireless Communications.\nFor other cable companies, the move has focused market attention, which had been flagging, back on the fast-growing sector, with stock market valuations now looking a little low.\n\"People are reassessing the value (of cable companies). There could be more consolidation. They have to respond,\" McFadden said, adding that calculations suggested a 2.9 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) tag for C&W's Mercury unit after the deal.\nTelewest Communications shares jumped 12 pence to 135, while General Cable gained 18 to 197 pence.\nThe British cable market is growing fast, with around 7.5 million homes now within striking distance of connections, as around six billion pounds has already been invested in building cable networks and a further six billion is planned.\nThe new company will eclipse its rivals in terms of market share, with 2.47 million homes within reach, compared with its nearest rival, Telewest, with around two million.\nBut analysts said it would not be in direct competition with other cable network companies as they mainly operated in different franchises.\nCable & Wireless Communications may flex its muscles in securing more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake, analysts said.\nBSkyB shares were down 16-1/2p to 680p, after touching a low of 678p.", "Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world's increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday.\n\"Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company,\" Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain's opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk.\nExamples of where rules had been broken by so-called \"rogue traders\" were a clear sign of management failure, he said.\nChristine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management's current ability to deal with regulatory problems.\nThe health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said.\n\"Do we prepare directors and managers enough?\" Cumming said.\nBritain's often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called \"self-regulation,\" is also under scrutiny.\nDarling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system \"will be reformed.\" But this would not mean \"tearing everything up or dramatic change,\" he added.\nHe said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient \"clout reputation and stature\" to deal with its international counterparts.\nBut it would not create a \"Super-SIB,\" an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations.\nDarling's call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference.\nAngela Knight, Britain's economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said.\nKnight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was \"a more salutory lesson than any regulation\" to other banks and financial institutions.\nThere were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals.\nBut while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading.\nAnd while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring.\n\"Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends,\" Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting.\nThis would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries.\n\"The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements,\" Large said.", "Detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan faces the capital charge of plotting to subvert the government based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad, a human rights group said on Saturday.\nWang Dan's case was expected to come to trial next week, the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement.\nRelatives said on Friday they had succeeded in finding a lawyer willing to defend Wang, the former leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.\nThe Beijing People's Intermediate Court on Thursday informed Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, that she had one day to find her son a lawyer, a signal that the dissident had been indicted and a trial was imminent.\nThe family on Friday obtained a copy of the court chargesheet, which formally accused the 26-year-old of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death.\nThe indictment cited four major areas of evidence against Wang, Human Rights in China said.\nThe first was the writing of articles published in overseas magazines and newspapers, including some that criticised the government, in the three years since his release from jail.\nWang served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations, which were crushed by the army on June 3-4 with heavy loss of life.\nOther evidence against the former student at prestigious Beijing University included taking part in studies at home organised by the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States, Human Rights in China said.\nThe charges accused Wang and other dissidents of joining forces to collect funds and donations to help other dissidents facing difficulties and the lack of work after their release from prison, the group said.\nWang was also accused of accepting donations and economic aid from overseas organisations, it said.\nWang's lawyer had already visited the court dealing with Wang's case to begin legal formalities, but there was still no news of when the trial of the former student leader, who has been in detention since May 1995, would begin, a close relative said.\n\"We feel pretty anxious. We are just waiting for new developments,\" the relative told Reuters.\nThe outspoken activist attracted the ire of China's communist authorities in 1989 when he shot to prominence as a leader of student protests for more democracy centred on Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital.\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng -- a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize -- of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.\nThe court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\nWang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.", "Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of copper have moved through Chinese customs into central stocks and are staying put, despite fears the metal could be sold to take advantage of current high prices, traders said on Monday.\n\"It was a good decision to buy good quality metal at 85 to 90 (U.S.) cents a pound; now they are feeling smug,\" a South American industry executive said of China's central authorities.\n\"It is central buying, there is no doubt about that because none of it is moving out,\" he said.\nChina recently boosted central copper reserves by 300,000 tonnes, with most of it now having cleared customs formalities, although a lag in Chinese customs reporting may keep the figures off the books for a couple of months, trading sources said.\nFew Chinese trading companies would have the financial resources to buy and then store substantial amounts of copper, a Shanghai trader said.\nThe recent surge in world spot prices had been expected to fuel a flow of Chinese material on to the world market.\nBut a modest rise last week in stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore -- traders said about 3,000 tonnes -- indicated the Chinese material was staying home.\n\"It's a piddling amount,\" a trader in Hong Kong said of the increase in stocks in Singapore.\nLME copper trading has been volatile in recent weeks, with a moderate rise in stocks on Friday, the first since early September, pushing prices down on profit-taking and liquidation.\nThree months copper finished Friday at US$2,242, bouncing off support around $2,220 in the afternoon ring, dealers said.\nLosses were kept to a minimum, they said, as market jitters centred on the upcoming December options declaration. The main concern was if December copper came close to $2,600, where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls.\nWith LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50, the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $2,600, which total 168,750 tonnes.\nTraders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling.\nWhat little movement there has been out of China, some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore, was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, the Shanghai trader said.\nWhile China was neither actively buying nor selling now, it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year, traders said.\n\"The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers,\" a marketing executive with a major producer said.\nHe said China's crackdown on scrap imports, coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters, would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes.\nThe opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996, he said.\nOfficial customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995, to 549,571 tonnes, with October imports 82,655 tonnes.\nThe new smelter, a joint venture between Tongling and Japan's Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year, the marketing executive said.\n\"They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate, and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal,\" he said.\nIn other base metal markets, premiums to Hong Kong remained largely unchanged.

Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination.\nMagna said it will repurchase about 600,000 shares of the stock, under its current repurchase plan.\n\"We certainly will consider buy back programmes beyond that, but nothing has been approved beyond that,\" G. Thomas Andes, Magna chairman, said in a news conference.\nWaterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.2 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa.\nMagna, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company.\nAfter the acquisition, Magna would have about 55 percent of its assets in Illinois, 25 percent in Missouri and 20 percent in Iowa, Andes said.\nThe deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators.\nMagna said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures.\nSome of the cost savings will come from job cuts, though those cuts could come from attrition, Andes said.\nHomeland Chief Executive Erl Schmiesing said during the news conference that cuts were underway at Homeland in any case as it consolidated.\nMagna will continue to consider other acqusitions, possibly in Iowa, Andes said.\n\"We certainly like the state of Iowa,\" he said. \"We would certainly welcome the opportunity to expand in the state of Iowa, as well as Illinois and Missouri.\"\nMagna is also among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets, a perception that did not change with the Homeland acquisition announcment.\n\"It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,\" said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray.\nHomeland's stock rose $1.75 to $35.75, while Magna edged down 6.25 cents to $24.81 Tuesday on Nasdaq.", "Canadian nickel giant Falconbridge Ltd has a growing appetite for expansion and is poised for growth through acquisition and exploration, the company's new chief executive officer said in an interview.\n\"The appetite of this company is much higher than what it used to be,\" Oyvind Hushovd told Reuters on Wednesday. \"Falconbridge is in very good shape financially today, which means that we have the ability to grow.\"\nHushovd, 46, replaced Frank Pickard as chief executive this month after Pickard died suddenly at the age of 63 during a business trip in Chile this September.\nHushovd, originally from Norway, has worked for Falconbridge for more than 22 years.\nHe spent the past year and a half working closely with Pickard in the position of executive vice-president and was chairman of the steering committee that put together a strategic plan to carry Falconbridge into the next century.\n\"I don't see a need to revolutionize Falconbridge,\" he said. \"The backbone of Falconbridge is nickel, and copper is another leg of Falconbridge. It will probably be like that in the future.\"\nHowever, Hushovd is not content simply to sit back and let the long-term strategic plan unfold.\nThe plan calls for Falconbridge to double its annual nickel production to 200,000 tonnes and triple its copper production to about 500,000 tonnes a year, within 15 years.\nTo do that, Falconbridge needs to find growth opportunities, especially since the company lost a bid to take over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel, copper and cobalt deposit in remote Labrador, said Hushovd.\nOngoing work in New Caledonia, Ivory Coast and Zambia should complement plans to start producing nickel by the end of next year at the Raglan project in Quebec and plans to produce copper by 1998 at the Collahuasi joint venture project in Chile, Hushovd said.\nIn Zambia, Falconbridge joined a consortium in November to develop the Konkola Deep copper mine, in which Falconbridge is partners with South Africa's Gencor Ltd and Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.\nIn New Caledonia in the South Pacific, Falconbridge is poised to gain access to nickel reserves to supply a nickel plant planned in the north of the country. The board of France's Eramet on Thursday said it had agreed to reallocate its mining reserves in New Caledonia, which would give Falconbridge access to Eramet's Koniambo field.\nHushovd does not intend not stop there.\n\"Falconbridge has always been very strong in exploration,\" he said. \"We felt we lacked the business development infrastructure.\"\nSo last summer, the company set up a business development group, to search out growth opportunities either through exploration or acquisition.\nWhile Hushovd would not hint at specific acquisition targets, he stressed, \"I want properties that are not only profitable today but are also profitable in the future.\"\nIn any future acquisitions, Falconbridge can probably count on support from its powerful majority shareholder, Noranda Inc, which owns 46 percent.\n\"We have a big owner, which means that hopefully we can pursue things that might be tough to pursue on our own,\" Hushovd said. \"We can have a bigger appetite than the company on its own would have.\"\nHushovd said he had no immediate plans to boost the company's share price, which peaked at C$32.75 in May but is currently trading around C$29.15.\nHe noted that the stock normally reflects the nickel price, which has failed to meet expectations in 1996.\n\"I think we all had very high hopes for nickel this year, and the market did not turn out the way that we had forecasted,\" he said.\nAs for next year, \"I feel it's difficult to give a prediction at the present time. Fundamentally I do believe we're going to see better prices in 97 than we did in 96,\" Hushovd said.", "Australian furniture, whitegoods and computer retailer Harvey Norman said on Wednesday it was trailing behind its target for 15 percent annual sales growth and that cool summer weather had impacted on December sales.\nManaging director Michael Harvey told Reuters that December sales again grew by \"double digit figures\" on the same month a year ago, but was not matching the robust growth the expanding company traditionally enjoyed.\nExcluding sales from new stores, turnover in December, a peak month, rose only about five percent, Harvey said.  \n\"We are looking for a 15 percent increase (in 1996/97), which will take us from A$1.043 billion, which we posted last financial year, up to A$1.2 billion and at the moment we are falling short of that target,\" Harvey said in an interview.\nHe described the retail trading environment as the worst in the company's 15-year history, but stuck to his earlier hope that the second half of the current year ending June 30 would compensate for a slow first half.  \nHarvey declined to give a profit forecast but said the company was \"definitely not\" heading down the same path as retailers David Jones Ltd, Country Road Ltd and Just Jeans Ltd, all of which have announced steep interim profit downgrades.\n\"If we have a flat result or if we were indeed between flat and 10 percent down, we are going to be disappointed,\" he said.\n\"But I can assure you it's our belief that it won't be less than a 10 percent decrease on last year and it's certainly our hope that it will be an increase on last yeaer's profit result.\n\"But, again, because of the nature of our business, it's just too early to tell,\" he said.  \nHarvey Norman reported a dip in net profit after abnormals of A$30.41 million in 1995/96, but told shareholders at its annual meeting in November it looked forward to strong summer months from November to February.\nBut managing director Harvey said summer had so far been unseasonally cool in its east-coast markets, dampening sales of goods like air conditioners, refrigerators, fans, outdoor furniture and barbecues.\n\"That's really let us down more than anything else,\" he said. December and January are usually the firm's peak months.  \nHarvey Norman is still hoping for a heatwave, but hot weather has its biggest impact on sales before Christmas when a lot of discretionary household expenditure is spent, he added.\nThe company is also pinning its hopes on a turnaround in consumer spending in the first half of calendar 1997 to enable Harvey Norman to reach its 15 percent sales target, but Harvey said there appeared to be little joy on the immediate horizon.\n\"Through last year we were basically saying it's got to turn in the second quarter of'97 calendar year, but at moment there's nothing to indicate that's going to happen...,\" he said.  \n\"My view is that next financial year starting July it will be a better year than this year and last year, but in terms of when it will actually start to turn, we are hoping...it will be the second quarter,\" Harvey said.\n\"I don't think we are going to see much joy in January, February, but it's our hope that things will turn come March, April, May, June,\" he said.", "International Business Machines Corp. Monday reported a third-quarter profit that came in a shade better than Wall Street had expected, boosted by strong sales of personal computers and services.\nThe world's largest computer maker said net earnings were $1.29 billion, or $2.45 a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $538 million, or 96 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.\nExcluding a one-time charge of $1.8 billion related to its Lotus Development Corp. acquisition from the year-ago period, IBM's earnings were $1.3 billion in the 1995 quarter.\nSales grew 8 percent to $18.06 billion from $16.75 billion on the strength of PCs, minicomputers and computer services, IBM said. As expected, sales of mainframe computers declined.\nWall Street took IBM shares for a rollercoast ride after the report. They fell initially, then rallied on comments by the chief financial officer, and closed a fraction higher.\nThe midday rally took IBM to a new high for the year of $135.375. The stock closed at $130, up 75 cents.\nThe rally followed remarks by Chief Financial Officer G. Richard Thoman, who said in a meeting with analysts that he was \"very comfortable\" with the computer giant's prospects for the rest of 1996.\n\"I feel very good about the quarter and very good about the year,\" Thoman said.\nBut analysts still were concerned about company warnings that currency exchange rates, low prices for memory chips and higher-than-expected restructuring costs would hurt fourth quarter results.\n\"There were some cautionary comments about the fourth quarter,\" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst who was among several who lowered their fourth quarter profit estimates.\nAnalysts said they generally were pleased with IBM's ongoing cost-cutting, its successful transition to new products in all its hardware areas and its investments in its growth. Revenue growth was also better than expected.\n\"I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,\" said Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perrella.\nWhile mainframe computers no longer generate sales growth for Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, they remain one of the company's important profit centres.\nThoman told analysts that more of IBM's mainframes sales were coming through its computer services business, and that IBM will not see the full impact of sales in one quarter for its new machines.\n\"If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract.... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,\" Thoman said in an interview, citing an example.\nThe company said revenues were higher in North America, Asia and Latin America but were flat in Europe. Revenue at its services division grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion, IBM said.\nTotal hardware sales rose 8 percent to $8.4 billion. PC sales, AS/400 minicomputers, and storage systems were up, while RS/6000 work stations, mainframes, and semiconductors fell.\nIBM said pricing pressures hurt its semiconductor business.\nSoftware revenues were off 1 percent to $3.1 billion, largely due to a decline in host-based software, which runs on mainframes. Distributed software revenues grew significantly from the 1995 period. Maintenance revenues fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion.", "General Instrument Corp is setting goals for NextLevel Systems Inc -- the lead business to come out of a three-way corporate break-up -- of 35-45 percent annual operating income growth and 22-25 percent annual sales growth on operating margins of 10-12 percent.\nThose growth rates could be even higher this year, General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, adding he sees stock price gains ahead for all three firms being formed in the break-up -- NextLevel, CommScope Inc and General Semiconductor Inc.\n\"I'd look to CommScope and General Semiconductor to increase at above-average rates in the eight to 10 percent return range, maybe more. I see NextLevel Systems doubling over the next year to 18 months,\" Friedland said.\nShares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 22-7/8 Tuesday after the Chicago-based company announced a three-way split designed primarily to unlock the share value of NextLevel.\nFor CommScope, to be built on the world's largest coaxial cable business, Friedland said management's goals are 18 to 20 percent annual sales growth and 16 to 17 percent operating income growth with operating margins of 16 to 17 percent.\nFor General Semiconductor, to be formed from General Instrument's electronic component manufacturing operations, goals are 10 to 11 percent operating income growth on annual sales growth of 14-16 percent and operating margins of 20-21 percent, Friedland told analysts at a meeting Tuesday.\nUnder the plan, General Instrument shareholders will get one share in each of the new companies for each General Instrument share held, Friedland said.\n\"We may have to do a reverse split to comply with New York Stock Exchange rules,\" he said, adding closing of the transaction is seen by July.\nNo layoffs or hiring are planned. \"There are no staff actions contemplated as a result of the transaction,\" he said.\nGeneral Instrument has primary goals in the restructuring, Friedland said. One is to unlock the value of the businesses that will comprise NextLevel, which analysts said has been held back by General Instrument's other segments.\n\"Electronic conglomerates are not looked at very favorably these days,\" said Michael Geran, industry analyst at the Pershing Division of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.\nThe other goal, Friedland said, has to do with General Instrument's heritage as part of the cable television industry -- a legacy that has overshadowed its newer technologies.\n\"We're going to continue to service the heck out of the cable base, but we're also getting into provision of dial tone and data. We need to break out of that mold General Instrument has been in of being a cable supplier,\" Friedland said.\nHe said the company decided to proceed with the break-up because it showed in 1996 that it could meet its business objectives, after failing to do so in years past. \"We've made that transition from development to deployment,\" he said.\nDeprived of cash flows thrown off by the CommScope and General Semiconductors businesses, NextLevel will fund growth two ways. \"We do have a lot of visibility to cash flow in NextLevel Systems now that we have the products going out the door,\" he said. \"So we feel that, while NextLevel Systems may be slightly cash negative in'97, even our downside scenarios say we have more than adequate capabilities.\"\nIn addition, he said, most of General Instrument's debt will be loaded onto CommScope and General Semiconductor, which can afford to service it. \"That leaves CommScope and General Semiconductor in fine shape in terms of their capital structure because they do generate the cash to pay this debt off in the near-term,\" he said.", "Microsoft Corp. is expected to report a sharp slowdown in earnings growth Monday due largely to a sales surge last year when the software giant launched its Windows 95 operating system.\nOn average, industry analysts expect the company to post earnings of 90 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, up 15 percent from last year's 78 cents, according to First Call, which tracks earnings predictions. In last year's fiscal first quarter Microsoft reported net income of $499 million.\nAnalysts generally said the Redmond, Wash.-based company would post revenues in the $2.3 billion range for the period that ended Sept. 30, up from $2.02 billion.\nWhile Microsoft's growth rate is still healthy, and results are expected to be slightly higher than in the quarter ended in June, the company is facing difficult comparisons after last year, when revenues and earnings grew more than 46 percent.\n\"It's a tough comparison because in the September quarter last year was the initial release of Windows 95 and all the sell-in associated with that, so it was a great quarter,\" said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht and Quist.\nBut he and other analysts said Microsoft's business was continuing to expand steadily, benefiting from rising sales of personal computers and the increasing penetration of Windows 95 and the more lucrative Windows NT system.\nMicrosoft's already-high profit margins also are rising as the company sells a growing proportion of its software by preloading it onto new computers or selling licenses to large customers rather than shrink-wrapped boxes at retail stores.\nMicrosoft's business is expected to gain momentum through the fiscal year as the recently updated Windows NT wins more acceptance and the company rolls out a major new version of its Office software package beginning in December.\nFor the full fiscal year, analysts see earnings and sales up about 20 percent over last year.\n\"I think NT will really start ramping in the December quarter and in the first part of'97,\" said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. \"It's going to be a very powerful driver of earnings.\"\nOne cloud on Microsoft's horizon is the imminent arrival of a wave of \"thin client\" products such as the Network Computer championed by Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison.\nLate this month, Sun Microsystems Inc. is expected to launch a line of products code-named \"Mr. Coffee\" based on the increasingly popular Java language, which is being positioned as an alternative to the \"Wintel\" combination of Microsoft Windows operating systems on Intel Corp. processors.\nWhile corporate users are not rushing to desert their personal computer networks, the increasing publicity about alternatives could hurt Microsoft's stock price, which was off $1.25 Friday at $134.25 in afteroon trading on Nasdaq but still up more than 50 percent so far this year.", "The director-general of the BBC called on Friday for an increase in the British television licence fee to protect what he said was \"the most successful cultural institution in the world\".\nSpeaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, John Birt said the fee -- payable by all television set owners -- had fallen in real terms over the past decade and described the recent financial history of the BBC as \"miraculous\".\nHe said an increase was needed to help fund new services as digital technology multiplies the number of channels available.\n\"The BBC is the most successful cultural institution in the world, one of the great inventions of the 20th century. But it can no longer be taken for granted,\" Birt said.\n\"If it (the BBC) is to innovate with high-quality services in the new technologies as it has done again and again.... then at some point in the future -- and for the first time since 1985 -- we shall need a real increase in the licence fee.\"\nA colour television licence costs 89.50 pounds ($139.10) annually. Licence income totals around 1.8 billion pounds each year -- 95 percent of BBC income. The money funds the BBC's five national radio stations as well as its two television channels.\nSources at the BBC said it wanted a modest rise in \"low single (percentage) figures over time\". The BBC will shortly begin talks with the government to review the licence fee -- currently pegged to inflation.\nAny price increase would take effect from April 1, 1997. A general election is due in Britain by next May and the government might be reluctant to saddle viewers with a higher licence fee shortly before it went to the polls.\nBirt said the BBC was now towards the bottom of the European licence fee league table. He added that a top-rate subscription to satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, costs 300 pounds annually.\nThe BBC says it has achieved cost savings of 100 million pounds in each of the past three years and aims to build on its commercial success as Europe's biggest broadcasting exporter.\nBut Birt said more licence money was vital.\nDigital technology -- which will allow the creation of hundreds of new channels and interactive services such as home shopping -- is set to reach Britain next year.\nBSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite services in late 1997 and a terrestrial version is expected to follow within a further 12 months.\nThe BBC is planning to offer licence-fee payers supplementary programming and a 24-hour news service as it moves into the digital era.\n\"It (digital) will mean upholding our national role -- and opening new doors wherever we can for licence fee payers,\" Birt added.", "The largest Czech commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s., said on Friday that profits in the first nine months of this year fell some 10 percent due to accounting changes. The shares rose on the news.\nThe bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.\nThe bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its accounting method to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions.\n\"Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences,\" Ziegler told reporters.\nOnly those fees that have actually been paid are included in the figures now whereas outstanding receivables were included previously, he said.\nHe added that the amount of late fees that would have been included under the previous accounting method was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.\nThe bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.\nThe net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.\nUnder Czech accounting standards, which Ziegler said do not include the tital of 700 million crowns of unrealised gains from securities, Komercni's gross profit for the period was 3.87 billion, down from 6.83 billion year on year.\nHe told rpeorters that he considered the results to be \"very good\", but warned that simple annualisation of the nine month figures would not lead to a full-year profit forecast.\nHe said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors.\nSandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures,\n\"The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out 1996 forecast.\"\nHe added that the forecast was a 5.95 billion crown net profit, according to international standards.\nKomercni share price jumped 125 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to 2,125, and closed at 2,126 after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results.\nDealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors.\n\"Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock,\" he said.\nAdded Chen: \"We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity.\"\nKomercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a 48.74 percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a 9.65 percent stake.", "Intel Corp launched its new Pentium chip with multimedia extension (MMX) technology on Wednesday, promising TV-quality video, stereo surround sound and three-dimensional graphics for personal computers.\nThe world's largest computer chip maker, Intel has collaborated with more than 100 software developers, some of which have created programs such as UbiSoft's dizzying new car race game called Pod' especially for Intel's Pentium processors that have the new MMX technology.\n\"This means life-like colour, full screen video and graphics, CD (compact disk) quality stereo sound, real-time animation and a better Internet experience,\" Intel said.\nLong-awaited in the computer market, the MMX has helped drive Intel shares to record levels over recent weeks and is expected by industry watchers to boost computer sales.\nIntel shares rose a further four dollars on Tuesday to $143-3/8 but were down slightly in active early Wednesday trade.\nTrumpeting MMX as a \"giant leap forward\" for PC users, European technology director Ian Wilson told Reuters that new multimedia software written to take advantage of MMX technology ran up to 60 percent faster than on Intel's previous Pentium processors. Existing software runs up to 10-20 percent faster.\nIntel says the new technology will boost computer sales and soon become an industry standard.\n\"The new features we have introduced with MMX technology allow a much better, richer multi-media experience...and we'll see a home and consumer demand for PCs growing even more,\" Wilson said.\nIntel said that for the first time in its history, a wide range of consumer software was available right at launch to exploit the powers of the new chip.\nThe MMX chip will initially be offered with the 166 and 200 MHz Pentium processors, improving the performance of personal computer-based multimedia and high-speed communications with faster \"modems\" for speeding access to the Internet.\nA host of computer manufacturers are offering the Pentium MMX processor, including America's International Business Machines Corp, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Italy's Olivetti and Japan's Toshiba.\nBritish electrical retail chain Dixons said new Pentium processors with MMX technology would be available in some of its stores from Wednesday.\nWilson said he expected systems incorporating the new MMX technology to retail at between $1,500 and $2,000.\nAnalysts have estimated that Intel could sell 30 million to 45 million MMX chips this year -- about half of the microprocessor units it will sell this year.\nBut Wilson declined to comment on shipments, saying only: \"By end of year, a significant percentage of our microprocessors being shipped will be incorporating MMX technology.\"\nThe MMX chip, which is available on desktop PCs as well as on low-power portable computers, contains 4.5 million transistors and adds 57 processor instructions to speed up software instructions.\nThe added performance of the technology frees up more of the Pentium processor to work on several tasks at once, including low-cost PC videoconferencing over standard telephone lines.\nIntel said it planned to build technology to upgrade some of its older Pentium processors later this year.\nThe company does not expect a re-run of its experiences in 1992, when it was forced to recall hardware because of problems with its processor chips.\n\"I think we have learnt a lot from that experience,\" Wilson said. \"We're very confident of the quality and reliability of the product we are shipping.\"", "Monsanto Co. said Thursday it is considering several options for the future, including splitting into two separate, publicly traded corporations -- one a life sciences company and one a chemical business.\nOther options being weighed by the St. Louis-based company are to sell or merge its chemical businesses with other firms or to keep the chemical operations and restructure them.\n\"In recent years, the strategies and needs of the chemical and life sciences businesses have become quite different,\" Chairman Robert Shapiro said in a statement.\nWall Street applauded the possible sale or spin-off of the chemical business, which had been expected, sending Monsanto's stock to a new 52-week high of $42.75 early in the day. The shares later traded at $42, up $1.375.\nAnalysts said Monsanto's life science businesses -- including agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, food additives and pharmaceuticals -- likely would have a higher valuation as a separate company than if Monsanto remained intact.\n\"The key here is that the chemical business does not have the growth potential as the ag-biotech and the ag-chemical and the drug component could,\" NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said.\nMonsanto Chief Economist Nicholas Filippello said in a telephone interview that no options for the chemical operations had been ruled out.\nHe added that a decision was expected to be made as soon as possible, but did not give a timeframe. \"As soon as practical,\" he said.\nMonsanto had been expected to shed its chemical businesses, which are affected by economic cycles and the price of commodity raw materials, since the sale late last year of its worldwide styrenics plastics business.\nIn recent months, it has been the strength of Monsanto's agricultural business that has propelled the stock upward.\nSpinning off the chemical businesses as a separate company was the option that most analysts favoured, since it would not have the tax implication of an outright sale.\n\"I would say the chances of keeping it (chemicals) and restructuring it are pretty slim,\" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.\nThe chemical businesses that may be sold or spun off include nylon and acrylic fibers, Saflex plastic interlayer, which is sold to glass manufacturers, and speciality chemicals.\n\"The chemical operations.... would be very viable as a standalone company,\" said NatWest analyst Andrew Cash.\nCash said Monsanto's acrylic fiber, nylon and Saflex businesses have limited competition in the United States and very favourable cost structures.\n\"It would be a focused company with good technology.... and a lot of interest in the assets from a stock market perspective, if they choose to spin it off,\" Cash said.\nHowever, agricultural chemicals would remain as one of the crown jewels of the life sciences division.\nMonsanto's popular Roundup weed killer is key to Monsanto's agricultural biotechnology business. The company has developed crops that are genetically altered to resist Roundup.\nThe life science operations also would include food additives and Monsanto's G.D. Searle pharmaceutical division. In a recent report, NatWest said it expected Monsanto to keep Searle, which some analysts previously thought would be sold.\nIn 1995 Monsanto's chemical sales of $3.69 billion accounted for about 40 percent of the company's total sales of $8.96 billion. The chemical businesses' operating profit of $357 million was 30 percent of the total profit of $1.17 billion.\nIn contrast, agricultural profit of $523 million accounted for nearly 45 percent of the total.", "Britain entered new talks with China on Hong Kong's future on Wednesday, admitting it could give no consular protection to Hong Kong people holding special British passports after the Chinese flag is hoisted in 1997.\nSenior diplomats met to argue over handover details against a backdrop of disputes over a subversion law drafted by Britain and Chinese troop deployments in the British colony.\nThe agenda for the three-day meeting of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was confidential and it was not clear what, if any, agreements would be produced from the latest bargaining round.\nBut British chief negotiator Hugh Davies said a great effort was needed to surmount a raft of problems before the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people is handed over in 209 days.\n\"The subjects that we all know about...are questions such as continuity of law in Hong Kong, questions to do with right of abode, questions to to do with the international network of agreements that Hong Kong already has and which will be agreed to continue beyond 1997,\" Davies said.\nHis Chinese counterpart Zhao Jihua served notice that China, infuriated by the colonial government's liberal anti-subversion law last week, would not brook any more major unilateral changes in Hong Kong's legal set-up by Britain before 1997.\n\"During the period of the final days, we do not wish to see new troubles or new obstacles, because the remaining issues are more than enough to deal with,\" Zhao said.\n\"But we are still very confident, so long as the two sides sincerely cooperate with each other...we will solve all issues which are related to the transfer of Hong Kong in a timely and successful manner,\" Zhao said.\nHong Kong is to become an autonomous region of China at midnight next June 30, ending over 150 years of British colonial rule, under a treaty in which Beijing has vowed to let it keep its freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years.\nIn the latest of many twists in the transition, Britain's Senior Trade Commissioner, Francis Cornish, said on Tuesday London could not give consular protection to the more than 135,000 Hong Kong people holding special British passports.\nBritain in 1990 granted 50,000 heads of households in Hong Kong the right to a full British passport in a concession to widespread demands for passports for all residents following Beijing's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.\nCornish said China regarded these people as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil.\n\"The Chinese have made it very clear that they regard holders of British Nationality Selection Scheme passports, when in Hong Kong and when in China, as Chinese citizens,\" he said.\nBritish officials have also warned there could be a stampede home in June by Hong Kong people with domiciles abroad if China insists on them being present in person on handover day in order to keep their Hong Kong right of abode.\nBritain's liberal bill on subversion, designed to exclude China-style jailings of dissidents, goes to the Hong Kong legislature later on Wednesday, and its fate is unpredictable.\nChina condemned the move last week and said such a law was the sole prerogative of the post-handover government to enact.\nEarlier this week, British experts said they had failed to reach agreement with China in the JLG on Beijing's demand to send an advance party of People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to Hong Kong before the handover.\nThe quarrel appears to be over the size of the unit, diplomats say.\nHong Kong people have bitter memories of the PLA's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy students in Beijing in 1989.", "Increasing pressure from customers to hold down prices will keep a profit squeeze on U.S. medical device manufacturers in 1997, although the sector's biggest firms are expected to show healthy growth.\nOther variables looming over the industry are the naming of a successor to departing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Congress' mood on healthcare.\n\"Expectations are still for a positive environment from a Washington standpoint, but I don't think you can take that for granted,\" said Prudential Securities analyst Charlene Lu.  \nAfter six contentious years, Kessler announced his resignation from the FDA last month. The White House has not named a replacement. \"Questions like who replaces Kessler are going to have a big impact on whether new products get approved quickly,\" Lu said.\nCongressional and White House sentiment on reforming the U.S. healthcare industry is lukewarm at the moment, but could reemerge as an issue, analysts said.\n\"Meanwhile, managed care marches on and that will have an impact,\" said Wasserstein Perella analyst Robert Dunne.  \nHealth maintenance organizations, hospitals and others that buy medical devices -- such as pacemakers, catheters and heart valves -- are squeezing device makers for lower prices. That has cut into profits and limited the growth potential of some companies, analysts said.\n\"You're going to continue to see greater and greater market pressures,\" Lu said.\nIn search of growth, many device companies are looking overseas and finding opportunity. \"To grow the top line, you've got to move outside the United States,\" said Dain Bosworth analyst Rachael Scherer.  \nPartly as a result, the sector's biggest firms -- those with global reach -- had the best 1996 and are widely expected to lead the pack again next year. Companies such as Medtronic Inc, Boston Scientific Corp and Guidant Corp are widely seen as market outperformers for 1997.\n\"I'm looking probably for 20 percent-plus earnings growth from them.... Those stocks will probably perform a little bit better than the market,\" Dunne said.  \nPossibly less rosy is the general outlook for small device companies. Scherer pointed out that Nasdaq medical technology stocks severely underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index this year, while larger listed issues topped the index, mirroring a dichotomy seen in other industries, as well.\n\"We're optimistic that Nasdaq med tech issues will outperform next year,\" Scherer said.\nSmaller and mid-sized firms named by analysts as potential 1997 winners were Datascope Corp, Target Therapeutics Inc, Stryker Corp, Mentor Corp, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc.\nOn the technology front, growth was expected to continue to be strong for stents, which shore up the insides of diseased blood vessels, and implantable defibrillators, which treat too-rapid heartbeat.\nKey products expected next year from industry giant Medtronic include an atrial fibrillation device, a device for continually recording electrocardiogram readouts to help diagnose unexpected fainting, a new stent and an implantable drug pump for cancer patients, Medtronic said.", "Japanese banks, already groaning under problem loans, are dangerously exposed to the volatile Tokyo stock market and a further drop in the market may finally force them into a blood-letting reorganisation, analysts say.\nThey say that if the weaker banks are to survive, they must trim the size of their less-profitable assets, including those overseas, cut their stock portfolios and reduce the number of their employees.\n\"Weak banks may be thrown into the sector-wide reorganisation unless they take a serious look at reality -- that the market is urging an aggressive restructuring, even if they have to cut the number of employees,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president at Smith Barney International Inc.\n\"If share prices in (weak) banks fall to very cheap levels, it might be easier for big banks to bail out those weaker banks through cheap mergers,\" he said.\nMarket sources said the recent Japanese share price plunge has been led by active selling of shares in the banking sector, which represent one-quarter of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's market capitalisation.\nOn Monday, the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares closed down 609.70 points, or 3.37 percent, at 17,480.24.\nEven though the market recovered slightly last week, the Nikkei is still down close to 2,000 points since the beginning of this year on worries about the economy and a lack of government measures to prop it up.\nJapanese banks have traditionally held large chunks of shares in other companies, many of them customers. In the past, the unrealised profits on these holdings have helped burnish the banks' balance sheets and have provided a useful way of getting some of their problem loans off their books.\nBut the failure to tackle the problem more aggressively has in turn fueled scepticism about the soundness of the Japanese banking system, triggering more selloffs in the stock market, analysts said.\nThe analysts said banks should try to raise their profitability by focusing on specialised business fields, by developing new financial instruments and by lending to smaller firms with prospects for future growth.\nKatsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said: \"To convince investors, banks must take the extra step to restructure, but they have made no such effort so far.\"\nIn the three business years to the end of March 1996, Japan's then top 21 banks used 8.01 trillion yen ($68.4 billion) in net capital gains from the sale of equities to help dispose of 18.96 trillion yen ($162 billion) of property-related problem loans, a legacy from the late 1980s economic \"bubble\" era of inflated asset prices.\nBut the top banks still had 17.4 trillion yen ($148 billion) of problem loans at the end of last September, the Finance Ministry said.\nMoody's Investors Service said on Friday that the sharp fall in Japanese shares will affect financially weak banks.", "Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins.\nDescribed by one British company as \"eco-terrorism\", it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s.\nFamous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted.\nActivist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless, badly organised ragbag of students and hippies.\n\"You only have to see them in action at protests,\" said David Harding, spokesman at ARC, Hanson's aggregates company. \"They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation.\"\nOne road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal \"Building\" earlier this year, \"If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business.\"\nAs well as financial threats, companies also emphasise the \"terror\" tactics used.\nCostain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building, bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell's home.\nA Costain spokesman told Reuters:\"We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line.\"\nTactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation.\nOther larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert.\nThe groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire.\nBut they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic, pollution and damage local communities.\nThe government has slashed its road-building spending. Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological.\nGraham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said:\"I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project.\n\"But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now.\"\nHe says the damage comes in two forms: \"Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity.\"\nWatts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract.\n\"I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.\"\nARC says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself.\nIts own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass.\n\"It was called the \"First Battle of the Newbury bypass',\" said ARC's Harding.\n\"We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future.\"\nSimon Brown, analyst at investement bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk.\n\"When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis.\"\nHarding says others have done the same. \"As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security.\"\nFor an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe.", "Nearly one quarter of ITT Automotive Inc's workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly and benefit rate of less than $10 an hour by 2000, the company's top executive said Tuesday.\nITT Automotive, a unit of ITT Industries Inc  paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers less than $10 an hour in 1995, and 10 percent that amount in 1990, said Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive.\nThe numbers, provided by Leuliette at the Automotive Industries' Executive Management Conference, were offered as another illustration of how auto suppliers need to continue slashing costs if they expect to remain an independent player in the fast-changing industry.\n\"Do we do that because we're mean?\" Leuliette said of the falling rates. \"No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3-4 percent price reduction.\"\nLeuliette spoke as part of a panel discussion with J.T. Battenberg, president General Motors Corp's Delphi Automotive Systems, and Robert Oswald, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Robert Bosch Corp's U.S. automotive unit.\nAsked how much a supplier should expect to pay workers, Leuliette said the global hourly rate for labor-intensive assemblies such as wiring harnesses is $1 to $2. More technical products are made for $10 to $12 an hour.\n\"If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,\" he said.\nBattenberg had three areas of advice for suppliers: focus on a few product areas; continuously stress quality; and pursue international alliances with other suppliers to expand more efficiently.\n\"I just don't think you can be all thing to all people. It's a lesson we learned at General Motors the hard way,\" Battenberg said.\nOswald said suppliers need to be more than good product innovators. \"At Bosch, we believe that our performance as a supplier is not based just on innovation, but also that weare meticulous in bringing that innovation to production,\" he said.\nMeantime, Leuliette said in 2000 suppliers to ITT can expect to receive 80 percent of what they are paid now for their products.\nHe noted the supplier industry is under such pressure to reduce costs that firms need between eight percent and nine percent productivity growth in order to keep their present level of employees.", "This month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit could see conflicting views between regional powers eager to boost free trade and a Chinese delegation more interested in soft loans, diplomats said.\nWhile Pacific heavyweights such as the United States, Japan and Canada aimed to lower trade barriers between the region's markets, China was hoping to squeeze easy credit out of richer APEC members at the summit in the Philippines, they said.\n\"There's a fundamental tension between China on the one hand and most other APEC states on the other,\" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.\n\"Should (APEC) be directed toward the trade-investment liberalisation framework or should it be directed toward economic and technical cooperation?\" asked the diplomat.\nAnalysts say the Subic summit would also give Chinese president Jiang Zemin a key opportunity to put his personal seal on a recent upturn in cross-Pacific ties at the first Sino-U.S. presidential meeting since 1995.\nWhile the forum would provide the Chinese delegation with a welcome venue for private talks with the United States -- and possibly rival Taiwan -- Beijing would be less keen on the summit's avowed free trade agenda, the diplomats said.\nChina feared throwing open its doors to foreign competitors could devastate China's struggling state sector, raising the spectre of social unrest, the Western diplomat said.\n\"There is a fundamental contradiction between the imperatives of China's domestic situation and the free trade agenda,\" he said.\nAccess to its potentially vast markets would be the juicy carrot China dangled in front of other APEC members in exchange for promises of soft loans and technical assistance, he said.\n\"China.... is hinting that APEC members should make a'down payment'.... on economic and technical cooperation, i.e. fork out some money,\" he said.\nBeijing could be looking for the creation of a special APEC fund to assist the region's developing countries, he said.\nThe economic summit would also provide China's Jiang with a rare chance to rub shoulders with other world leaders and to boost the recent warming in Sino-U.S. ties long battered by disputes over trade, human rights and arms proliferation.\n\"The Chinese like to talk about the'APEC style'...you shelve sensitive agendas and sensitive questions and you talk about them behind closed doors,\" the diplomat said.\nBeijing could also use the meeting to quietly resume talks with its island arch-foe Taiwan, he said.\n\"It's an ideal opportunity for them to get together in circumstances where they've got a fairly good chance of...keeping news of it hush-hush,\" he said.\nOther analysts said there was little chance of backroom talks between Beijing and Taipei officials because China was unlikely to soften its stance towards the island, which it has viewed as a rebel province since the end of civil war in 1949.\n\"I don't expect any breakthrough in Taiwan-China relations at the APEC meeting because the two sides set their own conditions, and very different ones, for resuming talks,\" said Chiu Chao-ling, a research fellow at Taiwan's Academia Sinica.\nWhile other APEC members send heads of state to attend the forum, Taiwan, at the insistence of Beijing, has been allowed to send only low-ranking officials to lead its delegation.\nTaipei wanted to crack open its diplomatic isolation at this year's summit by sending President Lee Teng-hui or vice-president Lien Chan, but host Manila rejected the move.\n\"It looks like Taiwan puts too much focus on its APEC representative, but not on what it can do as an APEC member,\" said Taiwan's Chiu. \"We should play a more active role instead of asking only who can go to the meeting.\"", "The international partners in Australia's largest gas project said on Thursday they plan to spend A$6.0 billion to double production, making it Australia's largest single resources investment.\nAustralian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd said the partners in the North West Shelf gas project offshore Western Australia plan to double production capacity to 14.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year.  \nThe decision by the North West Shelf partners was unlikely to boost the much-touted prospect of a co-operative development with the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce six million tonnes of LNG a year, analysts said.\n\"The North West shelf partners have their own plans for expansion, but if the Gorgon partners have a good proposal that we can work together then we will certainly have a look at it,\" said Woodside's corporate affairs manager Geoff Wedgwood.\n\"But to date we have not seen a plan from them that fits within our plans,\" Wedgwood told Reuters.  \nLast month an executive of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in both projects, raised hopes that the two projects could be developed together and questioned the expansion of the Shelf on a stand-alone basis.\nCor Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell's committee of managing directors, then told Reuters in an interview that expansion of the North West Shelf could not be justified without integrating it with another project and that the development of both projects was a viable option.\nRoyal Dutch/Shell also owns 34 percent of Woodside.  \nWoodside, the project operator, said the expansion plan was submitted to the project's eight Japanese power and gas utility customers at a meeting in Osaka this week.\n\"It is a significant step for the expansion of the North West Shelf project,\" Wedgwood said. The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.\nWoodside is an equal one-sixth shareholder in the project along with some of the world's major oil producers.\nThe Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.  \nHowever, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.\n\"The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal,\" Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there are lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the proposal.\n\"Following that would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998,\" Wedgwood said.  \nOnly after this agreement would work start on the expansion. Besides Woodside and Shell, the other equal partners in the Shelf are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Chevron Inc and a partnership of Mitsui & Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.\nShell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.", "Toronto stocks ended firmer in brisk dealings on Friday, adding another 10 points to the week's gains of 90 points and bringing the key 300 index closer to breaking its all-time high.\n\"We just refuse to move lower,\" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie. \"We're just ignoring all the bad news.\" The Toronto Stock Exchange key 300 Composite Index rose 10.9 points to end at 5193.0 points on Friday.\nThe TSE 300 has recovered from its lows in July and is climbing towards its all-time high of 5248.37 points reached in late May.\nThe index may test the high next week, Beattie said.\nOn Thursday Canada's central bank cut short-term interest rates by 25 basis points, easing the key bank rate to 4.25 percent.

But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances.\nNext it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, making his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net.\nThe Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on its heels for the rest of the game.\nBut veteran Valencia goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta held his ground on Pavel Kuka's dangerous turnaround blast from just outside the penalty spot, and then robbed Jan Suchoparek in the dying minutes of the game, stopping the midfielder's drive from three metres away to keep the game scoreless.\n\"I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team.

The toll market, a problem area for the company in previous quarters, came good with stable market share and a 6.1 percent increase in revenues year-on-year.\nVogel said the market was absorbing competitive access providers (CAPS) like MFS Communications Co Inc and Teleport Communications LP, without hitting the Bells' growth.\n\"Results show that the main business lines of the Bells are untouched in both price and volume by the CAPS,\" he said.\nNevertheless, Bell shares remained muted on Thursday, with none of those reporting results moving more than 1.5 percent.\nThe Bells have underperformed the broad market this year, with analysts saying investors remain concerned about regulation and competition stemming from the 1996 Telecom Act.\nThis week's good news, in the shape of a legal challenge to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) jurisdiction over the pricing process for reselling local circuits to competitors, is still lost in the broader Bell worries.\nThe FCC has to review the prices the Bells can charge for access to their local customers in 1997.", "Britain's Granada Group, which won control of hotel and catering empire Forte in January, on Wednesday reported a 37 percent surge in full-year profits to 480 million pounds ($804 million).\nThe media and leisure group said that it would deliver on its promise to improve profits at Forte by over 100 million pounds per annum from 1996/97.\nGranada chairman Gerry Robinson called the results \"very satisfying\". \"The key has been the speed with which we have been able to move on the Forte businesses,\" he told Reuters.\nGranada took over family-controlled Forte in a 3.9 billion pound deal earlier this year after a bitter bid battle that raged over the Christmas and New Year period 12 months ago.\nThe company said that Forte had responded well to its management and that it had already improved profitability there by approaching 40 million pounds.\nGranada continues to reorganise following the acquisition of Britain's leading hotel group. Robinson said there was substantial interest from a wide range of potential purchasers of the luxury hotels it has put on the market.\nGranada sold the first of the 17 Exclusive hotels on Tuesday when Hong Kong based Mandarin Oriental International Ltd bought London's Hyde Park Hotel for 86 million pounds.\nRobinson said that Granada expected to complete the disposals by early 1997.

CAT plans to develop drugs on its own up to intermediate stage clinical trials, and then find partners to help fund the costly business of late-stage trials, registration and marketing.\nThe strategy would enable the company to keep a higher percentage of profits from drug sales than if it introduced a partner early on, but will also increase its costs.\nThe Bioscience Innovation Centre (BIC) said it hoped to raise up to 6 million pounds through a share placing and open offer, and to list its shares on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).\nThe money will go towards the construction of a 20,000 square foot building in Cambridge which will act as a \"business incubator\", offering technical and commercial skills to budding biotechs.\n\"In the U.S, sector-specific business incubators have been shown to have a positive and dramatic effect on the success rate and growth of start-up businesses,\" BIC said.\nIt added that the planned centre would give suitable companies access to \"professionals in the fields of intellectual property, commercial management, licensing, marketing, regulatory affairs and finance.\"\nTeather & Greenwood have been appointed as advisers and brokers for BIC's flotation.", "Canadian envoys on Tuesday dismissed reports that thousands of Hong Kong people in Canada may be forced to flock home en masse ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China in order to protect their residence rights.\nCanada's commissioner in Hong Kong, Garrett Lambert, and the country's ambasador to China, Howard Balloch, said they believed China would soon decide on the issue, which has been a stumbling block in Sino-British talks on the territory.\nBut Lambert said Hong Kong people who had emigrated from the British colony might have to live in Hong Kong as Canadians in future and lose their local voting rights after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997.\nLambert told reporters he had been informed by China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, that progress was being made by Chinese and British negotiators on the problem of right of abode.\nThe question is one of the major unresolved issues facing the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which meets this Wednesday.\n\"This is a good file.

Encased in bamboo scaffolding, Hong Kong's new convention centre only recently gained a partial roof, testament to the territory's speedy construction methods.\nThe meeting is expected to provide China with a showcase for the handover, which was evident in less obvious ways at Friday's IMF gathering, too.\nDeparting colonial governor Chris Patten started the day with a sideswipe at Beijing, telling delegates that Hong Kong's economic success was due largely to its increasingly democratic government.\n\"The government has responded (positively) to that process and to the changes in aspirations which have accompanied it, by welcoming ever wider public participation in the process of government,\" Patten said.\nTung Chee-hwa, the territory's incoming chief executive, ended the day with a reminder of traditional Chinese values of cooperation.\n\"Within our community of Asian countries we must forge cooperation through dialogue and understanding,\" he said in closing remarks.\nTo help foster this mood of cooperation, Tung pledged to visit his Asian neighbours soon.\n\"As soon as possible, I hope to be able to visit our neighbours in Asia to extend my hand of friendship and cooperation.\"\nYam cemented the day's upbeat handover theme with a reminder that, in economic terms, the \"one country, two systems\" policy was little more than maintenance of the status quo.\n\"Under these arrangements there will be one country, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities which are to be mutually independent,\" he said.\n\"These arrangements are admittedly new but definitely not as novel and complex as EMU (European Monetary Union) with one currency for many countries,\" he added.\nBut as a reminder that things are changing irrevocably after 150 years of British rule, many of Hong Kong's colonial administrators were on their way home after seeing their careers cut short by \"localisation\".\nMany expatriates were sailing on two of the world's greatest cruise liners, the QE2 and the Oriana, a dramatic reminder that an era is ending and that Hong Kong itself will soon be sailing in uncharted waters.", "Daewoo Cars Ltd, the British motoring arm of Korean conglomerate Daewoo Corp, is considering transferring its unique UK marketing strategy to new markets.\nIn an interview with Reuters at this week's British International Motor Show in Birmingham, Daewoo UK Ltd managing director Tong Won Rhie said: \"We are now reviewing the performance over the past two years, and the UK strategy has proved a good model.\"\nHe said adapting the policy of cutting out car dealerships by selling directly to customers, which has rapidly carved Daewoo a significant slice of Britain's highly competitive car market, \"is a big possibility.\"\nDaewoo already operates in 12 European countries and is preparing to launch its models, which are revamped versions of old General Motors Corp cars, in five more.\nIn its first nine months of operation in Britain last year Daewoo sold more than 13,000 cars. And by October 8 this year Rhie said it had already sold another 18,500 units.\n\"Our target when we launched was one percent market share in three years. We have already reached that,\" Rhie said.\nDaewoo, which likes to advertise itself as breaking the mould of car supply in Britain, launched itself through cleverly targeted publicity, including surveys of customer likes and dislikes.\nRhie summed up customers' pet hates as \"too much hassle\" from salesmen and poor aftercare once the sale was complete.\n\"It is like a wedding, with the customer as the bride. Before, they say I love you, darling,' and all that, but after the marriage they forget,\" Rhie said.\nDaewoo was the first company to offer three years' free servicing on all models and packed its cars with extras including airbags and mobile phones.\nIt has also led a revolution in all-inclusive pricing, a trend followed this week by GM unit Vauxhall Motors and by Porsche AG with its new Boxster sports car.\nBut Rhie said its U.K. strategy was not applicable to all markets, particularly those where the relationship between car producers and dealers is even more entrenched than in Britain.\n\"The UK market is more sophisticated than many other countries. The level of (consumer) awareness is higher.\"\nDaewoo has encountered severe criticism from rivals, some of whom are alarmed at the speed with which it has penetrated the British market, where it has overtaken longer-established names like Saab, Mitsubishi and Hyundai.\nSome question whether its pioneering servicing agreement with the Halfords superstore chain can provide the level of support for customers that it claims.\nDaewoo's response to criticism that its current range of models is outmoded will be to launch three entirely new cars at the end of 1997. Rhie said one of these, known as the J Car, had been developed largely by its U.K. R&D operation in the southern town of Worthing, which employs nearly 1,000 people.\nRhie declined to state Daewoo's next target for U.K. market share. \"Quantity is very important but that is not the final goal,\" he said. \"Our aim is a customer focus and how to continuously follow up customers' requirements.\"", "United Auto Workers bargainers reconvened at General Motors Corp.'s headquarters Tuesday following a day off Monday, but talks between the two sides maintained a low profile, UAW and company spokesmen said.\nUAW workers continued to report to their jobs at GM's U.S. factories, despite the expiration of their national labour agreement with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday.\nGM spokesman Charles Licari said there were no major \"main-table\" meetings scheduled Tuesday, but key negotiators were communicating in small groups and by telephone.\n\"Discussions are taking place, but there is no set timetable regarding the negotiations,\" Licari said, adding that such communications still may prove fruitful.\nA person close to the talks said, however, that he did not expect the situation to change much before Saturday, when the union's key local GM plant-level leaders are scheduled to meet in Detroit.\nUAW President Stephen Yokich recessed the talks on Monday and expressed disappointment with the lack of progress toward a settlement, but he refrained from calling a strike against the world's largest automaker.\nStill, Yokich said some of the union's GM locals may resort to strikes if progress in local negotiations does not improve. In addition to the national contract, GM is negotiating with more than 100 UAW locals for pacts that cover plant-specific issues.\nIn New York on Tuesday, GM Chairman Jack Smith said little about the UAW negotiations, but told reporters that he hoped there would be no local strikes.\nThe threat of additional strikes comes less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week walkout over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors.\nSmith, speaking at a news conference on alternative fuel vehicles, declined to specify the dollar cost of the strike.\n\"We lost quite a few cars,\" he said.\nGM said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts.\nThe automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants affected.\nGM's nearby Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant remains completely idled, as does its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich. Five other assembly plants remain partially idled, bringing GM's laid off assembly workers to 15,284.\nGM has 5,702 engine and transmission workers laid off, with six such powertrain plants partially idled.\nIn the UAW talks, which cover a total of 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, GM has resisted the union's demand that it follow a pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and guarantee jobs for 95 percent of current work force over the next three years.\nGM wants to exclude from the guarantee several parts plants that it wants to sell. The automaker has identified 12 facilities that it considers uncompetitive.\nGM's stock gained 50 cents to $54.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "United Nations' plans to delay Iraq's re-entry to world oil markets lifted oil shares in Europe on Monday as a sharp rise in oil prices fed through to the stock markets, traders said.\nIraqi military activity in the Kurdish north, prompted the U.N. to put on hold a planned humanitarian Iraqi oil-for-food exchange, stopping the first sales of Iraqi oil since the Gulf War six years ago.\nThe increased tension in the Middle East and delays to Iraqi supplies lifted crude prices and, said analysts, was likely to raise market estimates for the third and probably fourth quarter.\nOctober futures for benchmark Brent crude opened 70 cents a barrel higher on London's international Petroleum Exchange.\nShares in Enterprise Oil climbed 10-1/2p to 520p, while Lasmo rose three to 196-1/2. British Petroleum was up 5-1/2p at 628p and Shell Transport 6-1/2p at 939p. In Amsterdam, Royal Dutch rose 2.70 guilders to 250.70.\nThe Iraqi humanitarian oil sales had been expected to hit markets in the next few weeks but after the latest developments traders were questioning when and if those supplies would come back on stream.\nThat could mean an upward revision of as much as $1.50 on Brent crude oil prices for the next few months with the possibility of the Iraqi sales ban lasting into 1997.\n\"I'd rather wait and see how likely or how long delays to Iraqi sales are going to be before I get too panicky,\" said one leading oil analyst.\n\"Almost certainly there is going to be a strong fourth quarter now as well as the third. People are going to have upgrade numbers for this year but for next year it's a bit early to say.\"\nThe resultant boost to earnings forecasts are likely to provide support to share prices across the sector with most analysts having expected an oil price fall in the fourth quarter as the humanitarian sales came through.\nConsensus forecasts had been around $17.70 per barrel for the fourth quarter compared with an average of just under $20 in the third, analysts said.\n\"We were forecasting $19.50 for the third. We'll have to raise that in the light of this news and also our fourth quarter which was $17.50 by between $1 and $1.50 per barrel,\" said Lehman Bros' Wendy Anderson.\n\"The purest plays are the exploration and production companies - Enterprise, Lasmo and Saga. You pick a pure play if you believe the delay will last into 1997,\" said Anderson.\nIntegrated majors Norsk Hydro, BP, Elf, Total and Royal Dutch/Shell also provided fairly good exposure, she said.\nTotal shares rose 4.2 francs at 376.7 in Paris and Elf gained 7.6 francs to 376.4. Norsk Hydro added two Norwegian crowns to 296.50.\nBut while the Iraqi situation will underpin stocks in the near term, it is long-term trends that will determine significant outperformance in the sector.\nThe real issue was at what point -- if at all -- people decided that forecasts for oil prices through 1997, 1998 and 1999 should be higher, said Nick Antill of BZW.\n\"At this stage I don't see anything that would make one want to do that. In investment terms, the sector is only really going to start motoring if people start bumping up the long-term trend rather than just this year's estimate,\" he said.", "Japan will set up a panel on Tuesday to tackle the after-effects of the nation's problem loans -- collection of bad loans in the form of land collateral, government sources said on Monday.\nThe panel will discuss wide-ranging steps to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans, a government source said.\n\"The central issue for the panel will be studying measures to collect problem loans in the form of land collateral run up by (failed)'jusen' mortgage firms,\"  he said.\n\"We think securitisation of the problem loans is one effective measure to collect problem loans,\" he also said.\nOfficials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency will join the panel, along with officials from the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan, a semi-governmental body set up to protect depositors from bank failures.\nThe Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), in charge of recovering the problem loans of failed mortgage firms, known as \"jusen\", and the Resolution and Collection Bank (RCB), which will perform a similar task for troubled credit unions, will also send officials to join the panel.\nOfficials are now finally aware they must take steps to stimulate the real estate market from a budgetary standpoint, said Yoshinobu Yamada, analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.\nHLAC was set up in July to recover the problem loans of seven failed mortgage firms over the next 15 years. But the government says further losses may arise and that half of any future losses will be covered by public money.\nIn June, the government adopted a controversial scheme that allows for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.17 billion) in taxpayers' money to help wind up the failed mortgage firms.\nThe government has also committed itself to meeting any potential shortfalls at the Resolution and Collection Bank with government funds.\nThe bank was established last month to manage the holdings of failed credit unions and collect their problem loans. The government has given the bank a 10-year period to bail out credit unions and aims to disband the bank thereafter.\nSome analysts said, however, that it would be tough for the ministries to agree on steps to boost the sagging real estate market, now in a five-year-long slump following the bursting of the 1980s \"bubble economy\" of inflated asset prices.\nFor instance, Japan may have to allocate budget funds for public utilisation of assets put up as collateral for problem loans, analysts said. The government should also adopt a flexible taxation system to help securitise problem loans backed by real estate, they said.\nSecuritising the loans involves selling property to a new special-purpose company, which in turn will issue bonds backed by these assets to procure money. Investors in the bonds would profits from any rise in land prices and from rent income.\nThe number of investors in Japan is still limited due to fears of further drops in land prices, and financial institutions themselves are reluctant to sell collateralised land at the currently cheap market prices, analysts said.\nBut Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securities, said the setting up of a panel to discuss this dilemma is an important first step. \"It is better than nothing.\"", "Major Japanese non-life insurance company Yasuda Fire & Marine Co Ltd announced on Monday that it plans to take a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S. life insurance giant CIGNA Corp.\nTerms of the deal, which would be the first time a Japanese non-life insurance company has purchased a life insurance subsidiary, were not disclosed.\nYasuda said it would boost its business cooperation with CIGNA Corp of the United States by taking a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit, INA Life Insurance Co.\n\"It is the first time a Japanese non-life insurance company has taken over a life insurance company. We have cooperated over the past 15 years and that experience made this possible,\" Yasuda president Koichi Ariyoshi told a news conference.\nAriyoshi said the relationship between CIGNA and Yasuda was an example of private-sector cooperation between Japanese and American companies even though Washington has protested Tokyo's newly revised insurance law, which it says violates a U.S.-Japan trade agreement.\nThe companies began cooperating in 1981 and Yasuda acquired 10 percent of INA in July 1993, and now plans to boost that stake to more than 50 percent within the next year or two, Ariyoshi said.\nUnder Japan's new Insurance Business Law, which took effect on April 1, non-life insurers and life insurers are allowed to enter each other's business sectors through subsidiaries.\nJapan and the United States have been at odds over the entry of Japanese insurance firms' subsidiaries into the so-called third-sector market, a lucrative niche market that covers accident insurance products, among others.\nJapan's Finance Ministry is likely to put conditions on the entry of domestic insurance companies' subsidiaries into the third sector, industry sources said.\nAriyoshi did not disclose the cost of the planned purchase of INA shares. However, he added the cost was similar to what it had cost non-life insurance companies to establish life insurance subsidiaries.\nJapan's 11 other non-life insurers set up life insurance subsidiaries earlier this month with share capital ranging from 10 billion yen to 30 billion yen ($92.5 million to $277 million).\nThe life insurance subsidiaries are expected to begin operations in October.", "Toronto stocks ended weaker in light trading on Thursday, swept lower by a downdraft in the oil and gas sector.\nToronto's key 300 Composite Index fell 40.52 points to 6071.89.

The shooting caused one pregnant woman at the scene to miscarry under emotional shock,\" the Chadian Human Rights League (LTDH) said in a December 26 report.\nA Paris-based human rights group, in its account of the executions, said a pregnant woman suspected of stealing grain in a market was shot dead on the spot by gendarmes on November 16.

It has been privatised for ideological reasons\", he said.\n\"I was shocked by the method, which was despicable and perhaps even illegal as the 1986 (privatisation) law specifically called for the parliamentary privatisation committee to give a supporting opinion,\" he said.\nJacques Delors, former president of the European Commission, told a conference in Paris on Sunday, \"I would have preferred to maintain a European pole in consumer electronics.\"\nOn Monday, French business newspaper La Tribune Desfosses added to the controversy by reporting that a French businessman, whom it did not identify, was preparing a bid for Thomson Multimedia to keep the company French.\nThe report said it was only after the government declared its preference last Wednesday for Lagardere's bid over a rival offer from Alcatel Alsthom that authorities realised \"the value of the gift it (the state) was making to Daewoo.\"\nA Thomson-CSF spokesman declined to comment on the report of a \"white knight\" bidder.\nA Lagardere spokesman said bids had closed in September and if investors were interested in Multimedia, they would have to negotiate with Daewoo after it had bought the firm.\nJospin said French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe were allowing the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo, which would reap the benefits of French state financing for the group's digital technology.\n\"Thanks to state finances, it will be able to take up a strong position in the digital (television) market and be profitable from 1999,\" Jospin said.\nThomson Multimedia is set to make big profits in 1999, when revenues from technology licences will contribute at least one billion francs ($192.3 million) a year. The licences were acquired when Thomson bought RCA of the United States from General Electric in 1987 but only revert to Thomson after 1998.\n\"We are not hostile to a foreign company taking control of Thomson Multimedia as it follows an industrial and economic logic,\" a spokesman for the Thomson-CSF association of employee shareholders said.\nBut, he added, it was a pity the state had not played its part as a shareholder to recapitalise the group earlier.\nA source close to Thomson said the group's financial situation was untenable as its share capital was insufficient to sustain its debt and that it was in dire need of fresh funds.\nBut the government is tightening its belt as it cuts public spending to meet tough requirements to join the single European currency by 1999. The Thomson privatisation was also launched as part of the government's consolidation of the defence industry.\nThe Thomson Multimedia unit, the world's fourth-largest TV maker, reported a loss of three billion francs in the first half of 1996. It has invested heavily in digitial television technology and is a leader in television decoders, as well as a being a member of the Digital Video Disc consortium.\nThe chairman of the South Korean company, Bae Soon-Hoon, has said he is ready to invest $1.5 billion in France and create 5,000 new jobs if he wins Multimedia.", "CSX Corp may be hard-pressed to top an aggressive and pricey bid for Conrail Inc. unleashed Wednesday by rival Norfolk Southern Corp.\nThe Norfolk Southern $100-per-share offer came just eight days after CSX agreed to acquire Conrail in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or about $92.50 per share.\n\"This (Norfolk Southern) bid comes without any regulatory risk, is all cash and is higher. So it's one-two-three - a knockout punch versus the old bid,\" said Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.  \nAt the very least, CSX will likely be forced to change its cash-and-stock offer to an all-cash bid if it wants to stay in the game, railroad and merger experts said.\n\"The Norfolk Southern bid is a very high bid. It's a rich premium and an attractive deal for Conrail shareholders. I don't know if CSX will be able to come up with an all-cash bid,\" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.\nNorfolk Southern's bid did not completely surprise Wall Street because the Virginia-based railroad last week had expressed concern about the proposed CSX-Conrail transaction.\nBut some were startled by the nature of its offer.  \nNorfolk Southern's bid aims to lure Conrail investors by offering immediate payment for their stock. It would then place the shares in a voting trust until the deal closes.\n\"The Norfolk Southern offer takes the risk away from (Conrail) shareholders. You've got to be impressed with that,\" said one takeover stock trader.\nUnder last week's Conrail-CSX agreement, Conrail shareholders would be required to authorize the tender of 40 percent of Conrail shares for placement in a voting trust. The rest of the shares would be exchanged for stock at a later date and would be subject to market fluctuations.  \nShares of Conrail, which said it will review the Norfolk Southern offer, soared 11-1/4 to 96.\nThe bid by Norfolk Southern represents its second attempt to buy the railroad that was formed by Congress in 1976 out of the remains of six bankrupt entities. Rumors about Norfolk Southern's interest in Conrail have surfaced on Wall Street periodically ever since it unsuccessfully tried to buy the railroad from the government in the 1980s.\n\"They're not usually very aggreesive from a financial point of view, but they've been keeping their balance sheet clean for a long time,\" Hatch said about Norfolk Southern.  \nCSX and Norfolk Southern are eager to capture Conrail's valuable Northeast presence amid widespread industry consolidation.\nEarlier this year, Union Pacific Corp bought Southern Pacific Rail Corp  for $3.9 billion after losing a fight for Santa Fe Pacific Corp, which was won by Burlington Northern Inc for $2.5 billion in 1995.\nBut unlike those acquisitions in which the target was viewed as a weak market player, Conrail is considered to be a much stronger railroad - a factor that could limit any potential cost savings or benefits to the successful bidder.\n\"Southern Pacific and Santa Fe were both not doing well and there was a lot of turnaround opportunity. Conrail is not sick. It's not a big turnaround situation and this is not a cheap price,\" said Cornelius Sewell of Argus Research.", "China gave new hints on Monday that its three-year austerity programme was over, pronouncing its anti-inflation fight a success and saying the new task was ensuring stability as the nation prepared to recover Hong Kong.\nChina's top leaders, after winding up four days of meetings on the economy, also said a key goal next year was to speed reform of ailing state enterprises.\n\"After three years of strenuous efforts, our national economy has had sustained, rapid and healthy development. The main task of keeping inflation under control has been achieved,\" the official Economic Daily said in its report on the meeting.\n\"Next year is an important one in our history as it marks the recovery of Hong Kong and the year of the 15th Communist Party congress,\" the official People's Daily said in a commentary that also called for economic progress in the midst of stability.\nChina slapped tight controls on government spending in 1993 to keep mounting inflation in check.\nThe credit curbs are likely to bring inflation below 6.5 percent this year, compared with 14.8 percent last year and a Communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.\nThe fall in inflation has allowed China to cut interest rates twice this year.\nMany economists have been expecting a further easing of monetary policies in the coming months as China is expecting a smooth handover of Hong Kong and social stability ahead of the key policy meeting of the Communist Party.\nThe British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997 and political planners in Beijing have been eager to ensure that there are no social or economic dislocations in the territory or on the China mainland to mar the transfer of power.\nThe party congress, scheduled for the second half of next year, is widely expected to result in an infusion of cash into the economy to bolster the standing of the current leadership as party personnel matters come up for discussion.\nMerchant bank Kleinwort Benson recently forecast credit expansion of 20 to 25 percent next year, compared with 17 percent this year.\n\"Naturally there will be some easing (of monetary policy) next year,\" said Cheng Xiusheng, an economist with the Development Research Centre under the State Council, or cabinet.\nHe added that the monetary easing would be limited, and would not trigger a new round of inflation.\n\"The focus is relatively quick economic development under the premise of stability,\" he said.\nOther economists agreed there would not be a return to higher inflation.\n\"If we have an adjustment, it will be a small one,\" said Zhang Zhuoyuan, director of the economics institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nHe added that reform of state-owned enterprises was still the key problem facing China's economic planners.\nState-owned enterprises have been losing money and massive subsidies have been draining state resources.\nPolitical leaders fear that cutting off these subsidies would lead to layoffs and social unrest though economists have said the strength of the economy gives planners a chance to tackle this problem now.", "With Chairman Jack Smith behind the wheel of a shiny red EV1, General Motors Corp. rolled its first electric vehicle out of the plant Thursday, marking what it dubbed the start of a new era in the auto industry.\nThe car was loaded on the back of an auto-hauling truck at the Lansing Craft Centre that will take it on the first leg of its journey to the West Coast.

The car is the first and only GM vehicle to carry a GM badge, instead of a name from one of its other seven divisions.\nWhile other automakers have developed and are selling electrically powered vehicles, GM says the EV1 is the first vehicle to be designed from the ground up as an electric car.\nIn his remarks, Smith called the EV1 \"the most technologically advanced vehicle platform in the world,\" incorporating 23 new patents.\nThe EV1 is powered by 26 12-volt lead-acid batteries. It can travel up to 90 miles before it needs recharging. The fully equipped EV1 comes with standard features, including air conditioning, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, power windows and door locks. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in less than nine seconds, and has a top speed of 80 mph.\nGM announced in October that it will sell the EV1 through a 36-month lease at a sticker price of $33,995. Buyers who receive a $5,000 credit from the state of California will be able to lease an EV1 for $480 a month. Monthly payments without the credit would be $640. The cost does not include a wall-mounted charger, which sells for about $2,000.\nProduction of the EV1 began at the Lansing Craft Centre in August. GM officials will not discuss how many EV1s they intend to sell or produce annually, although the Lansing facility has the capacity to make about 2,000 of the vehicles annually.\nSo far, Saturn has received more than 1,000 calls from potential buyers on a toll-free line, said Joe Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for the division. Of that, Saturn estimates about 250 are \"serious\" buyers.\nTalking to reporters after the ceremony, Smith said GM viewed the electric vehicle market as a long-term programme. He again would not say when the EV1 will turn a profit for GM.\n\"Our effort is to make the programme over time to be a business,\" he said. \"The niche is small to start, but it will grow.\"\nKennedy said the initial focus is not on volume but on generating a positive shopping, buying and ownership experience. He said the company will remain flexible in its production and sales plans to adjust to demand.\n\"This is a totally new market, and we don't know what the demand will be on any given month of year,\" he said, noting that Saturn has 13 EV1 specialists who have completed two months of special sales training.", "A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:\nJournalist: \"Could you please tell me Mr Novak's first name?\"\nSecretary, with no hesitation: \"Doctor.\"\nCzechs are obsessed with academic titles. It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained \"Doctor of Law\" which forced him to resign from the cabinet on Tuesday in a confession on the floor of parliament.\n\"In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,\" said Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute.\nNormal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as \"Mr Engineer\" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or \"Mr Doctor\", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers and PhD-holding journalists.\nKalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.\nHis resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised moniker, indicated by initials JUDr, in campaign material and biographies.\nApart from Kalvoda, only one has resigned from parliament, three others refusing to do so.\n\"I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,\" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of \"Dr\" for this story.\nThe Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title of Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD), but he does not inisist on its use by others.\nSome of the title-envy stems from four decades of communism, which ended with 1989's bloodless \"Velvet Revolution\" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.\nCommunist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.\nKalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.\nThe daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml -- a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.\nThe daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.\nHavel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and was never allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.\n\"He made himself a name, not a title,\" Lidove Noviny wrote.", "Family controlled food and retailing group Associated British Foods reported a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Monday, but chairman Garry Weston sounded a wary note when asked about the year ahead.\n\"I never play hostage to fortune.

We have no idea how they will impact on us.\"  \nABF posted pretax profits of 430 million pounds ($704.1 million) for the year ended September 14 whereas most stockmarket forecasts had centred on 415 million.\nWorldwide sales were up 17 percent to 5.707 billion. Profits were driven by an especially strong performance from the company's retail operations in Britain and Ireland. Operating profits rose 25 percent to 69 million, with the company's supermarkets in Ireland further increasing their market share.\nPrimark, the women's textile chain, included results from One Up stores bought from Storehouse last year.  \n\"We got the fashion right. Primark has been refurbished and that improved its buying power and gave it more notice on the high street.\" In the second half Primark was more in tune with public demand, said Weston.\nABF's food manufacturing and processing operations in Britain showed an 8.0 percent sales growth to 3.11 billion pounds and a 12 percent profits increase to 282 million.\nHowever, operating profits from British Sugar fell to 183 million. British Sugar sales are limited by European community quotas and the renewed strength of the pound made imports from mainland Europe look cheaper in the second half.  \nAFB's profits from its Australia and New Zealand operations increased by 20 percent to 38 million.\nAC Humko, acquired from Kraft Foods in September 1995, chipped in its first full year of profits to ABF's north American business to help turn a 3.0 million loss in 1995 to a six million stg profit.\nAnalysts were surprised by the stronger than expected performance from ABF's milling and baking business where margins improved strongly. ABF owns the Twining group of companies, Burtons Biscuits, Allied Bakeries and an animal feed business.  \n\"They were good numbers a bit ahead of our figures, but it will be hard to match that in the current year,\" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. \"The green pound rate is likely to mean a reduction in British Sugar profits and inflation in food prices looks very subdued,\" he said.\nABF shares rose 8p to 426p on the news.\nNet cash held by the company rose by 196 million to 797 million at September 14, after spending 242 million on its assets and acquisitions during the year.\nThe company is keen to expand in the Far East and although ABF's history is one of expansion by organic growth if the oppurtunity arises it will make acquisitions, said Weston.\n\"We have been picking up acquisitions and if opportunities come along for something big then we will take it,\" he said.", "A Silicon Valley company has developed a new technology designed to turn the World Wide Web from a random, hit-or-miss quest into a highly targeted personal service that it says can change to suit your mood.\nThe new service, known as The Angle, is available immediately as a showcase for Los Altos, Calif.-based BroadVision Inc.'s One-to-One technology for personalizing the World Wide Web.\nThe technology enables a person to set up an individual profile, or \"angle,\" combining personal interests and preferred style to customise the \"look and feel\" of the Web service.\nUsers can also chose from several \"personalities\" to try out different ways of viewing information on the Internet, or choose different profiles for different moods -- such as one for the business day and another for use at home.\n\"We give the user the remote control,\" Broadvision said in materials prepared for the formal unveiling Tuesday of The Angle site, at the URL  http://www.theangle.com.\n\"We put you in the driver's seat.

Branded as \"The Virgin Angle\", the service will include additional UK perspectives and is due to be available in the fourth quarter.\nThe new division is also advising Minneapolis-based Netradio Networks on \"The Netradio Angle,\" which is designed to be a music Web site recomendation service.\nBroadVision completed an initial public offering of stock in June and Chen said the company is currently ahead of its business plan.", "One year after the peak of Japan's banking crisis, financial institutions are still reeling from the shock, and some have not escaped bankruptcy, analysts say.\nBankers say the worst of the bad loan nightmare is over, but analysts believe Japan's financial industry remains vulnerable.\n\"It will take some time for confidence in Japanese banks to be restored -- at least until real estate transactions are reactivated,\" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International.\nBad loans largely take the form of land collateral.\n\"Even for big banks, it will take a few years to write off most problem loans and this will hurt their earnings,\" he said.\nFinancial analyst Hideichiro Nishimura at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said that despite vigorous efforts by the government and banks to clear the bad loan mess in the past year, confidence in Japanese financial institutions has not improved in international markets.\nCurrently stable share prices and low interest rates are helping banks dispose of problem loans steadily and on schedule, but their efforts to restructure operations still fall short of boosting their declining asset quality, he said.\nAugust 30 last year saw Japan's first bank failure since World War Two. The financial system was jolted as major regional bank Hyogo Bank and the country's biggest credit union, Kizu Shinyo Kumiai, collapsed due to adventurous lending during the \"bubble economy\" of the late 1980s.\nAhead of that dark day, the biggest credit union in Tokyo, Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, had collapsed, and then this year, second-tier regional bank Taiheiyo Bank went under.\nSeveral analysts expect more bank failures.\n\"Everyone knows what has to happen (more financial failures), but no one knows when and how and who pays,\" an analyst at a foreign securities firm said.\nTo dispose of 10.7 trillion yen ($99.0 billion) of loan losses, many of Japan's biggest banks posted net losses in the fiscal 1995/96, ended March 31.\nBut counting all deposit-taking institutions, on that date there were still 8.3 trillion yen ($76.8 billion) of loan losses which need to be written off, the Finance Ministry said.\nIn June, parliament passed bills to clean up the nation's bad loan mess and deal with bank failures, along with a scheme to wind up failed mortgage firms, using taxpayers' money.\nAnalysts are cool about such efforts, however.\nA spokeswoman at international credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said it has not much changed its BFSR (bank financial strength rating) since August last year, when it unveiled the BFSR for major Japanese banks for the first time.\nMoody's last week warned that some of Japan's seven major trust banks may need external support in order to survive growing competition and the burden of bad debts.\nMoody's gave Chuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking an \"E\" ranking, meaning that they suffer from very weak intrinsic financial strength, and gave only a slightly better \"E+\" rating to Mitsui Trust & Banking and Nippon Trust Bank.\nIt also kept Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank at the \"E\" it gave them last August.\n\"We expect banks with very weak financial fundamentals to ultimately require assistance either from the authorities or from their respective corporate group members,\" Moody's said.", "Colombia's main oil union postponed a decision to launch an indefinite strike in protest against the arrest of 11 members on terrorism charges after top-level talks with the government Sunday night, leaders said.\nThe 5,700-strong USO union, known for its fiercely nationalistic stance, had been due to set a start date for a crippling stoppage at a general assembly Monday.

They were going to use Gartmore as their fund management arm instead,\" Sibley said.\nSibley expressed disappointment at NatWest's decision, but rejected speculation that the remaining divisions under the joint venture -- corporate finance and equity stockbroking -- could also become vulnerable to NatWest pulling out.  \n\"Yes, obviously we're disappointed,\" he said. \"But there's no question of the equity and corporate finance business breaking up or anything like that. That is running along perfectly satisfactorily.\"\nThe joint venture, which offers corporate finance and equity stockbroking services as well as investment management in Hong Kong, became fully operational one year ago.\nSibley said he understood why NatWest wanted Gartmore.\n\"They had a very weak fund management side themselves and they needed to make a sort of quantum jump in that activity, which is what the acquisition of Gartmore did for them.\"\nHowever, NatWest's decision to pull out comes at a particularly sensitive time for the new fund manager.\nWheelock NatWest Investment Management is experiencing rising commissions but the completion of its research division, considered essential to attract major institutional clients, has only just been completed, Sibley said.\n\"It takes a long time to build up a research product, which we only just got about a month ago,\" he said.  \n\"The commission figures go up and up and up every month. They haven't had a single down month since we started. But the big jump comes over the next six months when you can offer the full service to the major institutions and hope that we can attract them to deal with us through the quality of our research and execution service.\"\nWheelock now hopes to find a European or North American partner, said Wheelock NatWest chief executive David Miller.\nHe said he hoped a decision would be made by Christmas.", "Investing in Asian telecommunications stocks is full of hazards as the region grapples with a general lack of sophistication and wide discrepancies in demand and regulation, analysts say.\nViews differ greatly on the potential of individual stocks and countries, but analysts generally agree that telecom regulation is the most important determinant to future performance.\n\"Understanding the regulators is essential as regulatory issues were the main determinant of Asian telecom stock performance last year,\" Jardine Fleming said in a recent report.\nAsian telecom bulls say the global information revolution, combined with the region's rapid economic growth, have swamped the capacities of state-run operators, forcing a confrontation between regulators determined to meet demand and monopolistic state enterprises anxious to maintain market share.\n\"Asian telecom regulators, usually under-empowered, have promoted liberalisation, often taking on strong political and economic forces,\" Jardine Fleming said.\nSo far, regulators have responded by issuing licences -- a politics-fraught move that usually diminishes the prospects of the primary telecoms firm.\nThis is acceptable in low-penetration countries with untapped demand, analysts say, but more dicey in high-penetration markets, such as Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\"This is why deregulation in Hong Kong did not really make sense on the fixed-line side if the new licensees could not access the lucrative IDD sector, which they can,\" Jardine Fleming said.\nDEREGULATION DAMPENS OUTLOOK ON HK, SINGAPORE TELECOMS\nContinuing deregulation in Hong Kong and Singapore, two places with a high dependence on IDD traffic, has prompted a negative outlook on Singapore Telecom and Hongkong Telecom, it said.\nIn low-penetration countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, regulators have issued concessions to build fixed lines, giving contractors the right to receive local revenues and perhaps a portion of those from domestic long distance.\nBecause the new local lines stimulate long-distance demand, this arrangement fails to attract the ire of primary telecoms which reap the benefit, analysts said.\nThis has worked well in Indonesia and the Philippines, where new local fixed lines are expected to boost earnings in both PT Telkom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) rather than eroding their market position.\nThe situation is very different in the cellular sector, where major market players are complaining that too many licences have been issued as they lose market share to strong second-tier players which are aggressively undercutting tariffs.\nBecause of this primary/secondary interplay, Jardine Fleming said it has turned negative on Advanced Info Services Plc and neutral on Piltel. But it remained positive on Total Access Communications Plc.\nMalaysia's Technology Resources Industries Bhd has been battered down too hard, the brokerage believes, and it has been upgraded to a buy.\nBROKERAGE BULLISH ON INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES\nDeutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) is similarly optimistic on the outlook for PT Telkom and PLDT, but it adopts a much less optimistic overall view of Asia's telecom sector.\n\"The Asia-Pacific telecommunications industry is undergoing a period of rapid transition from a relatively underdeveloped and protected industry to one which is becoming increasingly saturated and highly competitive,\" DMG said in a recent report.\nAn overall increase in competitive pressures is not being made any easier by governments' liberal approach to the issue of licences and the lack of any industry consolidation, DMG said.\n\"In an environment of increasing saturation and rising competitive pressures, EPS (earnings per share) will continue to come under pressure,\" DMG said. \"We believe that we are already witnessing signs of industry maturity.\"\nDMG estimates that less than 10 percent of the population in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia can afford telecom services.\nDMG is positive on Indonesia and South Korea, but for different reasons.\nIndonesia's lower telephone density combined with a restrictive and non-competitive regulatory structure are attractive, it said. In South Korea, a large middle class more than compensated for the higher number of phones.\n\"Although competitive pressures are rising, the combination of low, effective teledensity rates, a wide middle class and exceptionally aggressive capex and depreciation policy should ensure that Korea Mobile Telecom Co will continue to deliver above-average EPS growth rates,\" DMG said.\nEVEN TOUGHER TASKS AHEAD FOR REGULATORS\nAnalysts said regulators have done the easy part -- issuing new licences. Now it gets tricky as new licensees demand better terms on geography, interconnection and IDD rights. Cellular licensees are also demanding more spectrum.\n\"What will be interesting to watch is how quickly these number two companies demand that they compete on fair terms with the primary telecoms,\" Jardine Fleming said.", "Boeing Co.'s stunning agreement to acquire longtime rival McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a ringing endorsement from Wall Street and sent shock waves through the aerospace industry Monday.\nStock in both companies soared on expectations the deal would boost Boeing's operating profits immediately after its completion, targeted for mid-1997.\nBoeing rose $4.375 to $101.125 and McDonnell Douglas jumped $10.375 to $62.375, down from earlier highs on the New York Stock Exchange but good enough to give the all-stock transaction an indicated value of nearly $14 billion.\nIndustry analysts saw few obstacles to the deal, which marks a startling transformation for a company that just a year ago was completing a final round of cutbacks that had slashed its work force by 30 percent in five years.\nSince then Boeing has completed the $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s defense and space business, won the right to compete for the richest military contract in Pentagon history and announced orders for a record $45.6 billion in new commercial jets.\n\"It's an incredible turnaround story,\" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which specializes in aerospace. \"These are very bold, dramatic, uncharacteristic moves for Boeing and I applaud them for it.\"\nWhile Boeing had been moving to cut costs and transform its management style under outgoing Chairman Frank Shrontz, the pace has accelerated at the once-sluggish company since Phil Condit was named chief executive officer in April.\nCondit began the final round of merger negotiations with McDonnell Douglas last Tuesday, just a day after being formally elected Boeing chairman as of Feb. 1, 1997.\n\"We're seeing Boeing evolve from kind of a stodgy company to being very aggressive, nimble,\" said Bill Whitlow, a longtime Boeing analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who praised Condit's energy and stamina.\nExecutives at the two companies said the deal would be additive to operating profits immediately and reiterated their prediction that Boeing could achieve $1 billion in annual savings without any layoffs because of rapid growth.\nAnalysts said the merger was a good strategy for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced plans to pull back from commercial aviation when it was eliminated from bidding for the Pentagon's 21st century joint strike fighter.\nBut Harry Stonecipher, chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, denied that the merger was born of desperation.\n\"This is the deal we wanted and we are very happy with it,\" Stonecipher told CNBC. \"This is the only deal we considered.\"\nBoeing executives told analysts they had no immediate plans to make further acquisitions, even though the combined company will generate cash flow of more than $4 billion a year on projected 1997 revenue of $48 billion.\nThe surprise merger immediately turned up the heat on Europe's Airbus Industrie to move ahead quickly with a restructuring plan. Without such a plan, the consortium would be unable to go ahead with a proposed super-jumbo aircraft to compete with Boeing's 747, which now is unchallenged at the profitable top end of the market, analysts said.\n\"Airbus Industrie and its partners must agree as soon as possible on an optimal structure that will allow Airbus Industrie to match its American competitors as a powerful, integrated European enterprise,\" German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a statement.\nAnalysts noted that Boeing had ended any chance that Airbus would partner with McDonnell on a new large jet, and some said Boeing's own plans to stretch the 747 might now be deferred.\nBut both Airbus and Boeing could benefit from stabilized airplane prices with the No. 3 player out of the market.\nDespite some overlapping businesses, including helicopters, rockets and missiles, experts saw little possibility the deal would be stopped by the Defense Department, although the combination of the nation's only manufacturers of commercial jets could give pause to federal antitrust regulators.\n\"It will be interesting to see what the airlines have to say about this,\" said Don Baker, a former antitrust official now with the firm Baker and Miller in Washington.\n\"It's worth remembering that there would be just two players in the worldwide market for big planes,\" he said. \"But maybe two is enough competition for the airlines.\"\nOn the defense side, analysts said they expected the marriage of Boeing and McDonnell to spur further consolidation, with players such as Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. looking for partners.\nCowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the deal gives Raytheon, which supplies missile systems, \"a window of opportunity\" to buy Hughes Electronics Corp..\n\"It's not a long-term window,\" he said. \"It will probably last until the (Boeing-McDonnell) deal is closed.\"", "British opposition Labour party's plans for a one-off \"windfall\" tax on utility companies may be causing more stock market damage through uncertainty than the tax itself would, analysts said on Thursday.\nIf it won the next general election, due within six months, Labour has said it would levy a tax to reap excess profits from recently privatised utilities to help pay for welfare reform.\n\"The market does not like uncertainty -- give it a tax like this with no parameters and it will assume the worst-case scenario,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nAs parliament prepared to debate the issue, at the prompting of the ruling Conservatives, analysts said if the Labour party would be more specific about plans, some of the uncertainty weighing on utility shares might lift.\n\"They have promised to raid the utilities but they have not said which, how much or when, and that is damaging,\" said Philip Hollobone, analyst at Williams de Broe.\nLabour, which is well ahead in opinion polls, has said it would use the funds to tackle youth and long-term unemployment but has declined to set target companies, amounts or timeframes.\nNewspaper reports have suggested the tax might be aimed at raising more than five billion pounds ($8.42 billion) and possibly as much as 10 billion pounds.\nSpeculation on possible targets has widened to include up to 30 companies, like British Telecom, British Gas and perhaps airport operator BAA Plc, in addition to the water and electricity companies initially pointed to.\nSome of these, such as BAA, have already rehearsed arguments why they should not be included in any windfall tax net.\nThe water and electricity sectors, privatised around the start of the decade by the Conservatives, became unpopular after a spate of huge executive pay rises, hefty dividend payouts, and head-turning takeovers deals.\nOne analyst who declined to be named, suggested that the water sector stocks are currently undervalued by around five billion pounds, reflecting concerns over the tax.\nThames Water, for example, has underperformed the FT All Share Index by as much as 10 percent since late August, according Reuters Securities 3000 data, although its relative has improved recently to underperformance of some four percent.\nShares in regional electricity companies, however, were pulled in two directions as a resurgence of bids in the sector boosted speculation which analysts said may have offset some of the downside of a utility tax.\n\"The worries over the windfall tax are severely overdone...even if it does happen, most companies will be able to find the money, even if they do not want to,\" said Hollobone.\nAlong with several other analysts, he warns that even if Labour does win power it may not be able to effect the tax because of legal problems in ensuring it is non-discriminatory.\nSeveral utility companies have said they would challenge any windfall tax plans in court, but Labour's treasury spokesman Gordon Brown described the proposal as \"legally iron tight.\"\nOn Thursday, the Institute of Directors (IoD), which represents British business interests, warned against the tax although it acknowledged that \"some of the utilities do have spare funds at the moment.\"\nThe IoD said the tax could lead to problems over who should pay what amounts and said customers might face increased prices.\nThe Conservatives have claimed the tax could mean an extra 192 pounds on the average household bill and challenged Labour to come up with figures to contradict this.\n\"Investors who are wise to the market's over-caution on the proposed tax are buying. These stocks are undervalued and...some are yielding more than long-term bonds,\" said one analyst.", "Hong Kong's colonial Governor Chris Patten on Monday refused a request by future leader Tung Chee-hwa to support the interim legislature China will install in the territory when the British depart next year.\nShipping magnate Tung, emerging from his first meeting with Patten since being chosen on December 11 by a China-controlled committee to head Hong Kong from next July 1, told reporters that Patten flatly refused to provide any help to the new legislature in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China.\n\"I brought up the work of the provisional legislature. I hope Mr Patten and the Hong Kong government can give help,\" Tung told reporters outside Government House, Patten's residence.\n\"But Mr Patten's position was very clear. I didn't successfully convince him,\" Tung said.\nBoth men emerged from a 1-1/2 hour meeting to exchange hearty handshakes and make brief speeches to the press, but mentioned little else of what transpired behind closed doors.\nDescribing the discussion as \"long and constructive\", both said they agreed to meet in the future when the need arose.\nPatten, looking serious next to Tung, managed the occasional smile for photographers but turned to lead Tung into a waiting car immediately after his successor completed his short speech.\nNeither of them took questions.\nMonday's meeting was conducted under a cloud of strained Sino-British relations after China snubbed British objections and went ahead last Saturday with naming the provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Hong Kong returns to Chinese control 190 days from now.\nThe interim assembly was designed by China to reverse electoral reforms that Patten introduced unilaterally in recent years.\nThe move came under an international spotlight after British Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind on Friday challenged China to let the World Court rule on the legality of the new assembly.\nPatten also lashed out at the new lawmaking body on Saturday, calling its appointment by a 400-member Selection Committee \"a bizarre farce\" and a \"stomach-churning\" process.\n\"What it shows about China is that, here it is taking over responsibility for a First World economy but they're trying to foist on us political institutions which a Third World country would reject,\" Patten had said.\n\"Here we are having foisted on us institutions which, frankly, you wouldn't try to run a tennis club with,\" he said.\nChina, however, has warned Britain against creating problems and to keep out of Hong Kong's affairs after the handover.\n\"After 1997, Hong Kong will be an internal affair of China. No foreign countries can interfere with China's internal affair,\" China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, told reporters.\n\"Whether Britain wants to accept my advice is up to it. But if it wants to create more new trouble, I don't think it will be out of the ordinary,\" he said on Monday at a public function.\nThe controversial new body is dominated by pro-Beijing figures, including 33 incumbent lawmakers and many politicians who lost to pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 Legco election.\nThe Democratic Party, the biggest single winner in last year's election with 19 of the 60 Legco seats, boycotted the creation of the provisional body, branding it undemocratic.\nThe Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, is to sit from July 1 until a new legislature can be created via elections.", "A Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday.\nCTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining \"is nearing 10\".\nCentral bank officials were not immediately available for comment.\nThe Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks.\nUnder the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank.\nThe plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns.\nThe state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value.\nThe banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime.\nBanks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio.\nBanks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank.\nThe maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated.\nThe programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate.\nBanks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana.\nMoney for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme.\nAny losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency.", "Quick & Reilly Group Inc agreed on Wednesday to buy over-the-counter market-maker  Nash, Weiss Inc, another step by the pioneering discount broker into low-profile, but lucrative financial services businesses.\nTerms were not disclosed, but two sons of co-founder Leslie Quick Jr said in an interview that the acquisition of the New Jersey firm was by far the biggest deal Quick & Reilly has done.\nNash, Weiss buys and sells on behalf of retail brokerages some 2,500 stocks listed on the Nasda.  \nSalomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears said the acquisition may be the start of a flurry of deals involving market-makers in Nasdaq stocks as reforms in pricing threaten to narrow the often wide spreads on Nasdaq stocks.\nInvestors have complained that the price differences can amount to as much as 10 percent or more of a stock price.\n\"Going for market share through acquisitions is one way to make up for narrowing spreads,\" Sears said.\nHe said he knew of no pending deals.  \nAmong the top six independent Nasdaq market makers, Nash, Weiss profits on the spread, or difference between prices the seller and buyer get. It employs about 60 people, Quick & Reilly said.\nThe biggest Nasdaq market makers are subsidaries of big financial firms.\n\"This gives us another major leg,\" said Leslie Quick III, head of the company's U.S. Clearing Corp subsidiary. \"We expect this Nasdaq market maker business to be a fourth leg for us.\"  \nBest known as a retail broker, Quick & Reilly is also a significant force through U.S. Clearing in backroom processing of Wall Street trading and owner of the JCC Specialist Corp., the second-largest market-maker, or specialist firm, on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"The deal really plays well with The Quick & Reilly Group as whole,\" said Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears. \"With U.S. Clearing it gives Nash, Weiss a lot of potential for going after instutitional clients.\"  \nThomas Quick, president of the firm, said Quick & Reilly with Nash, Weiss would court institutional clients by adding to its roster of 2,500 securities in which it makes markets.\n\"That number will probably go to 3,500 to 4,000,\" Leslie Quick III said.\nThe brothers, whose father, chairman Leslie Quick Jr., co-founded the firm in the early 1970s, said the mightily improved  capitalization of Nash, Weiss after the merger with Quick & Reilly will make it much more attractive to large institutional clients.  \nThomas Quick said the leading market-maker for institutional clients had capitalization of about $80 million, or 20 times or more that of Nash, Weiss. Sears said Quick & Reilly had capitalization of about $350 million.\nThe brothers said they expect revenues at Nash, Weiss to rise dramatically as long as stock trading remains robust and may even double to $120 million by early 1998.\nBusiness has been strong in December and in January and should yield a strong fiscal fourth-quarter, Thomas Quick said. He declined to comment on analysts forecasts of earnings. Sears expects Quick & Reilly to report $0.77 a share for the period ending February 28. Last year, the company reported a normalized $0.91.\nCo-founder Leslie Quick Jr serves as chairman and chief executive of the firm, which was the first to offer discounted commissions on New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks after fixed trading commissions were abolished in 1975.", "The Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns, but analysts said they were not alarmed by the rise which is inline with their full year forecasts.\nThe Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September.\nThe CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and most analysts, however, have predicted the deficit -- accelerated by an economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish at a record 150-160 billion crowns.\n\"The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,\" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka.\n\"I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,\" he added.\nThe CSU in a statement said that imports rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year for the 10-month period, down from 15.2 percent for January to September, while exports rose by 5.2 percent, down from 5.9 percent for the first nine months.\nIt added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.\nAnalysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector, saying that imports of this nature are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting.\n\"The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,\" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters.\nAdded Martin Kupka of Patria Finance:\"The country is still clamoring for machinery and raw materials which are necessary for industrial restructuring.\"\nPrime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is \"not tragic\" saying it has come in part from a temporary foreign investment wave.\nThe Czech crown reacted indifferently to the trade figures, hovering around three percent above its dollar/mark basket parity, where it was for most of Monday.\nThe crown was trading at 26.919 to the dollar at 1230 local time (1130 GMT).\nThe rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +3.09 percent, after the central bank's fixing on earlier on Tuesday at +3.00 percent.\n\"The market is neither alarmed nor pleased with the figure. If the deficit hits the forecast level, I doubt we will see any significant change in the currency's value,\" said one local forex dealer.", "Shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa was to fly to Beijing on Tuesday to be anointed by China's communist leadership as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader when Britain pulls out in mid-1997.\nTung was to head for the Chinese capital in the afternoon after addressing Hong Kong's business community in his first major speech since he was selected as the territory's future chief executive last Wednesday.\nIn Beijing, he will have his first face-to-face meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng since formally launching his bid for Hong Kong's leadership mantle two months ago.\nIt was Jiang who signalled in January this year that Tung was Beijing's favourite for the job when he singled out the tycoon for a warm, personal handshake at a reception in Beijing.\nBritain is returning its last major colony to its former and future masters in Beijing at midnight next June 30, after a century and a half of colonial rule that turned it into one of Asia's economic marvels with a population of 6.3 million people.\nOne of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to cobble together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior mandarins to keep.\nHe has said he will start this task after his China visit, reinforcing speculation in Hong Kong that China will call the shots from behind the scenes on the make-up of the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\"If he waits before deciding on his team, there will be lingering doubts as to whether he was acting on instructions received from Beijing,\" the South China Morning Post said in its main editorial on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, the colonial government said it would set limits on how much it would help Tung to form a government-in-waiting before the transfer of sovereignty.\nConstitutional Affairs Secretary Nicholas Ng told the Legislative Council that the government ruled out a mass exodus of senior officials to the government-in-waiting because it would undermine the stability and efficiency of the present administration.\nThe colonial administration is supposed to cooperate with the incoming government under the handover agreement.\nBut the transition has been fraught with disputes over issues ranging from human rights and democracy to infrastructure projects, darkening prospects for serious cooperation.\nMany senior civil servants, including Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is Governor Chris Patten's deputy, and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, stayed away from a business dinner party attended by Tung on Monday night, though they had been invited.\nOfficials said Chan and Tsang had scheduling conflicts but political analysts said it might have been a sign that the administration's top two civil servants would not keep their jobs.\nThe 400-member, Beijing-controlled Selection Committee that selected Tung last week is now preparing for the next milestone in the march to Chinese rule -- the selection on Saturday of a 60-member, pro-China \"provisional legislature\" with which China plans to replace the existing, elected legislature on July 1.\nPatten again condemned the new legislature in an interview with the French newspaper Liberation on Monday, saying he would never cooperate with it.\n\"This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong,\" he said.", "Time in Tibet is a moveable feast.\nIn this far-flung outpost of Chinese rule, the clocks are synchronised with Beijing more than 2,560 km (1,590 miles) to the northeast, but dawn is two hours behind and everyone goes to work about two hours later than in Beijing.\nIt is not only Tibetan time that lags the rest of China. The economy in this Himalayan region, still based largely on yaks, goats and Buddhism, also trails.\nBeijing says it is doing its utmost to narrow the gap and to make up for destruction wrought on Tibet's monasteries and temples in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.\nIt has pumped more than 35 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) into the inaccessible, remote and backward region long peopled by nomadic herders and barter traders, officials say.\nThe funds are also useful to buttress control of the restive and strategically important region that borders India.\nThe investment is slowly paying off.\nEconomic growth in 1995 reached 10.6 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before. Rural per capita incomes were about 600 yuan ($72) a year while urban incomes neared 2,000 yuan ($240) -- both still about half the national average but increasing rapidly.\nIn the capital Lhasa, the swift growth of commerce has taken even local leaders by surprise.\n\"I thought it would take several years before we could attract any real interest,\" said Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment and Trust Corporation that in 1994 set up a stocks trading centre in Lhasa.\n\"But we had to double our space last year and we are already overcrowded and making plans for another expansion,\" he said.\nThat's the high flying end of economic development in Tibet.\nFor those at the other end of the scale, Beijing is trying to make things easier with preferential policies to help a people struggling into the late 20th century from a lifestyle that more closely resembles the middle ages.\nIncome tax holidays, tax breaks and easy loans are just some of the incentives available to businessman in Tibet. The concessions are also attracting numerous entrepreneurs from elsewhere in China where such favourable policies are not available.\nIn Lhasa, one street specialises in selling the highly-decorated, colourfully-painted furniture favoured by Tibetans. Another sells fake leather sofas that appeal to Han Chinese residents.\nChinese restaurants abound, cheek by jowl with Tibetan-managed shops selling yak butter, computer parts and bolts of brocade and wool.\nTibet offers some of China's oddest employment opportunities.\nIn a tiny one-room workshop leased from a struggling state-owned factory processing yak horns, seven artisans from neighbouring Yunnan province hammer traditional silver bowls embossed with Buddhist symbols.\n\"We were already making these Buddhist artifacts in Yunnan anyway,\" said workshop owner Li Wenhan, 26. \"It's only because there is so much demand here that we came. We could easily sell these in Yunnan, but here they need them.\"\nLi said 40 percent of the goods they make are for export, 20-30 percent are sold to Tibetans and the rest distributed elsewhere in China.\nThe success of Li's business underscores a problem in Tibet that must be as frustrating for its Chinese masters seeking to lead the region into prosperity as for many educated Tibetans.\n\"The Tibetans lack education and a mentality of work,\" said one Tibetan-Nepali businessman who was born in Lhasa.\n\"They don't appreciate the need to work, they just want to make a profit straight away,\" he said. \"It's very sad. They are too impatient to understand that you have to earn a living through steady work.\"\nWhile some might dispute that view, no one questions that Tibet is among China's poorest and most inaccessible regions. Out of Tibet's 2.3 million people, about 400,000 live below the official poverty line.\nOfficials oversee one of China's most innovative anti-poverty policies in the deeply devout Buddhist area where many still donate much of what they earn to monasteries and temples and where education is costly.\n\"We are determined to bring all Tibetans out of poverty by the end of the century,\" said an official who declined to be identified.\nAlmost all Tibetan government officials are involved in anti-poverty programmes. Each government department in the Tibet Autonomous Region sends officials into rural areas each year -- both to see where government money and aid are most needed and to teach poverty-stricken nomads how to boost their incomes.\nMany of Tibet's worst off are nomads living in remote mountain areas, many with large flocks of yaks, goats and sheep, but with little idea of how to exploit their resources.\nThe nomads either use their animals to feed themselves or, when their numbers climb, set them free as an offering to Buddha to try to win merit for their next reincarnation, believing that their station in each life is dependent on their behaviour in the previous one.\n\"Many of these people have assets but they are still poor because they don't know how to use them,\" the official said.\nTibet does not rely on handouts alone. Since last year it has worked at setting up sister relationships with 14 of China's booming eastern cities and provinces.\nThese wealthy cousins each send between 10 to 20 officials to work for three years in the region over a 10-year period and also provide financial resources.\nThe provinces are helping Tibet with 43 projects, mostly in infrastructure. Initial investment was 2.3 billion yuan ($277.1 million) but now totals more than 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million).\n\"Tibet's capacity to develop itself is very low,\" the official said. \"It's hampered by its geological conditions such as lack of infrastructure and its remoteness. And it takes a long time to move away from the previous feudal serf system.\n\"This is a very beautiful place but we have a very arduous task ahead.\"\n($1.0=8.3 yuan)", "Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed-line telephone network in a residential area in this southern city.\n\"Local telecommunications are for CEGETEL a major strategic axis,\" Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit CEGETEL, told a news conference.\nHe said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.\nIn mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.\nSFR expects to have one million customers by March 1997, Glotin said, against some 725,000 at the moment.\nThe local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in annual sales by 2003.\nGlotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.\nCEGETEL, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using DECT technology.\nThe version of DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, applied in Nice uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.\nDECT is also available in totally wireless versions.\nThe Nice experiment is small, with Glotin expecting 1,000 to 3,000 subscribers by the end of 1997, but it is a precursor of CEGETEL's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in local loops with radio links in the coming years to hone its skills ahead of market liberalisation in 1998.\nA DECT service in Paris is expected to be ready in 1998 as the biggest part of an initial series of 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.\nIn Nice, subscribers pay between 20 and 50 francs per month for a subscription, get a 10 percent discount on calls using the France Telecom network and pay about 0.22 francs per minute for local calls.\nThe CEGETEL shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs at the start of 1997 to fund investments. Glotin said that the final make-up of CEGETEL's sharecapital would be known by year-end but he said it would be very close to the October agreement with BT taking 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent.\n\"Changes are within the five percent limit,\" he said.\nGlotin said that the success of CEGETEL, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.\nTelecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.\n\"The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,\" Glotin said.\nAnother future rival to France Telecom is building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET.", "Japanese banks, still struggling under the weight of massive problem loans, now face tough decisions on how to adapt to expected structural changes to the country's economy and financial system, analysts say.\nThey say it is inevitable the banks will need to shift their focus towards creating new business and offering specific services to boost profits as demand for loans weakens.\nPrime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's \"Big Bang\" financial reform plans unveiled last month to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 will also accelerate competition.\n\"To increase profitability, Japanese banks must change the sources of their profits,\" said Koyo Ozeki, a director at international credit rating agency IBCA Ltd.\nOn Thursday, the Finance Ministry announced sweeping plans to deregulate Japan's foreign exchange market in 1998.\nEisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, warned that Japanese banks will face intensified competition as a result of the deregulation.\n\"I hope Japanese financial institutions will be well prepared for severe competition in the future,\" he said.\nTight regulation, dating back to the end of World War Two, has protected Japanese banks from competition and has made them less efficient than Western rivals, analysts say.\nAnd because of that, some analysts such as Shinji Okabe, senior credit officer at rating agency Moody's Japan, are pessimistic about the future of Japanese banks.\n\"It seems to me that Japanese banks cannot judge which business is profitable.... It looks like the banks all think they can do everything with unlimited resources,\" he said.\nSince the early 1990s, Japanese banks have written off problem loans resulting from their adventurous lending policies in the late 1980 \"bubble economy\" of inflated asset prices.\nBut as of the end of September, 20 major banks were still carrying 23 trillion yen ($201 billion) worth of problem loans.\nAnalysts say it will take two more years on average for the top 20 banks to cut the loans to manageable levels, giving foreign banks further chances to to nudge into the market.\n\"Foreign banks have expanded and strengthened their business base in the past decade, but Japanese banks were not able to do anything because they had to dispose of the problem loans,\" said IBCA's Ozeki.\nJapan's 20 biggest banks, down from 21 after a merger in April between Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, posted 22.85 trillion yen ($200 billion) in parent operating profits in an eight-year period to the end of March this year.\nDuring that time they also disposed of 21.7 trillion yen ($190 billion) in problem loans, Ozeki said.\nEven profitability at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which many analysts agree is the strongest Japanese candidate to become an internationally competitive bank, is low.\nThe bank's return on equity, a gauge to show the efficiency of the use of capital, is only about 7.2 percent, compared with Barclays Plc's 13.09 percent and Bankers Trust's 18.32 percent, an IBCA study showed.\nAnalysts say they expect more bank failures in Japan, particularly among smaller regional banks and credit unions.\nIn November, Japanese authorities ordered the regional Hanwa Bank to halt business, the third regional bank failure since the end of World War Two. Eleven smaller credit unions and associations have also gone under since December 1994.\nAnalysts said uncertainty over how to deal with troubled banks has not been entirely removed in Japan, and there remains some concern that larger and stronger banks may be drawn into the support mechanism at some cost to themselves.\nJapanese banks to which Moody's has given a bank financial strength rating (BFSR) of \"E\" are financially weak, Okabe said.\nChuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank are the E rated banks.", "Netscape Communications Corp. Tuesday unveiled a line of low-cost software to make corporate networks more like the Internet and said that it would \"embrace\" archrival Microsoft Corp.'s products as part of its war for control of the corporate software market.\nNetscape is under heavy attack from software behemoth Microsoft, which is seeking to wrestle away some of Netscape's dominant share in both Internet and intranet software.\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based upstart has about 80 percent of the Internet browser software arena with its Navigator software and between 60 percent to 70 percent of the exploding \"intranet\" market.\nA corporate \"intranet\" is a computer network designed around Internet technology and open standards.\nAs part of its plan to try to hold onto its lead and to gain entree to more companies, Netscape unveiled several products for the corporate market and said it was \"embracing\" Microsoft applications software and its operating systems because many potential customers rely on Microsoft products.\n\"We are very hard-core about.... fitting into our customers\"legacy' systems,\" Marc Andreessen, co-founder and senior vice president of technology at Netscape, told a news conference, in one of many jabs at Microsoft.\n\"Legacy systems\" is a term in the industry that usually refers to the established, older technology running a corporation, such as mainframe computers.\nNetscape stock dipped 62.5 cents to $44.25, while Microsoft rose $2.25 to $138.875 on Nasdaq.\nNetscape announced several new intranet products, including new software incorporating the latest upgrade of its popular Navigator Web browser, Version 4.0, and priced them way below similar offerings by both Microsoft and Lotus Development Corp., Netscape said.\nOne new software product, Netscape Communicator, combines Navigator and other components: Composer, to create documents in the hypertext markup language (HTML) used on the Internet's World Wide Web; Messenger, an electronic mail application; Collabra group discussion software; and the Netscape Inbox Direct service, which delivers messages and news stories to an e-mail address daily at no extra cost.\nNetscape Communicator will replace the current Navigator software for consumers. Communicator is priced at $49 for the standard version and $79 for the professional edition, per user.\nNetscape expects to make Communicator available by next year's first quarter for 17 major computer operating systems, including Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and Apple's Macintosh.\nUsers of Navigator 3.0 who have purchased a subscription will receive an upgrade to Communicator at no charge.\nNetscape also introduced an upgrade of its SuiteSpot software, which manages the server computers that run corporate networks.\nSuiteSpot is priced at $57,900 for 1,000 users. This compares with prices of $73,590 to $279,590 for competing products from Microsoft and Lotus, Netscape said.\nNetscape also unveiled an initiative to help corporate users make it easier to use its software with core Microsoft products, such as its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems and Microsoft Office with Netscape products.\nAnalysts said Netscape is trying to appeal to a whole new group of corporations by enabling its software to run with the huge installed base of Microsoft-based PCs and servers.\n\"The strategy is not to scare away the IT (information technology) managers,\" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst.\nNetscape's not-so-friendly bear hug of Microsoft is part of the David-and-Goliath war with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, for control of the Web browser market and more importantly, control of the corporate network. Netscape already derives 80 percent of it revenues from sales of intranet software.\nBut Netscape acknowledged it may lose some share in the future intranet software market, which Forrester Research is forecasting to reach $10 billion by 2000.\n\"Dominance is hard to measure,\" Andreessen said in an interview. \"I think we can get at least 50 percent of the intranet software market in five years.\"\nAccording to a recent Hambrecht & Quist survey of 200 companies, Netscape now has about 60 percent of corporate intranets, Microsoft's BackOffice has 30 percent and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Notes 10 percent.\nNetscape's Navigator software has created a huge brand name and a \"calling card,\" giving it entree to major  corporations. Now the company must execute its strategy and build a sales infrastructure, Andreessen said, a major challenge as its growth continues to explode.\nThe company, which went public in August 1995, is expected to grow to about 1,700 employees by year-end, up from about 400 at the time of its initial public offering, Andreessen said.\nAndreessen added that Netscape has not abandoned its consumer focus in favor of the corporate user.\nNetscape also signed deals with more than 70 manufacturing partners, including Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Ing.

And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.\nIts main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.\n\"Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,\" Shah said.\nUnderlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.\nCompanies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.\n\"We are coming close to the proverbial elbow of the hockey stick,\" said Merrin, referring to the hook upwards on sales charts that signifies explosive growth.\nIn one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.\nIngram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.\nThe company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.\nAn anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood \"Chip\" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.\nIngram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.\nBut any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.\n\"It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,\" said Shah for shares of the stock. \"I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,\" he added.", "North Korea expects a shortfall of two million tonnes of grain next year -- equal to 40 percent of the nation's needs and significantly worse than expected, a Red Cross official said on Monday.\nOnly a few months ago, aid workers had estimated the food shortage would be 1.5 million tonnes.\n\"Their shortages are serious...they (North Korean officials) have not been able to meet the daily food ration,\" said Ole Gronning, representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.\n\"This is bad news, really bad news in a country that already doesn't have much now,\" Gronning said by telephone.\nHe said farmers whose crops had been wiped out by devastating floods in July had eaten about 400,000 tonnes of grain before it came to maturity, adding this would worsen the food shortage this winter.\nNorth Korea has faced the spectre of famine since July after the floods destroyed about 373,000 tonnes of grain, compounding damage from widespread floods in 1995.\nOfficial figures showed North Korea would need 5.5 million tonnes of grain next year, but this year's harvest had yielded just 3.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.\nThe federation was trying to raise $10.5 million for a new programme to buy grain to stave off hunger for some 140,000 North Koreans badly hit by the floods, he said.\n\"In some of the villages and the valleys we are now going into, they were working on repairing the damage from the 1995 floods and then they got hit once again,\" he said.\n\"They have lost everything, including houses, livestock and so on,\" he said.\nThe summer floods had submerged large tracts of arable land for more than 10 days. Some of that land was now covered in sand and mud and could not be farmed again.\n\"The second floods left people in a really bad situation,\" Gronning said. \"People will be running out of food in the second half of December.\"\nThe federation would work with the North Korean Red Cross Society to distribute a daily ration of 450 grams (15.75 ounces) of grain and a helping of supplementary foods such as soybeans to each person, he said.\nAid workers would try to provide stricken residents with winter clothes and blankets to brace against winter temperatures that could drop as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said.\n\"Without enough food and without proper heating, these people are really badly off,\" he said.\nNorth Korea, despite its philosophy of self-reliance, cracked open the door to foreign aid last year in the face of looming food shortages.\nGronning said the federation had appealed to member societies in Europe, North America and Japan to donate money urgently needed to start buying grain and clothes.\n\"Hopefully, we will have the first pledges very, very soon so we can start purchasing,\" he said.", "One year after its dramatic expulsion from the United States, scandal-hit Daiwa Bank is finding its misfortune may in some ways have been a blessing in disguise, analysts say.\nThe painful fall-out from its $1.1 billion bond-trading loss in the United States, they say, forced the bank to take some of the bitter but necessary restructuring measures that other Japanese banks have been reluctant to swallow.\n\"Following its expulsion from the United States and inspections by Japan\"s Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan, Daiwa was able to eliminate management risks from its corporate structure,\" said Yukiko Ohara, a financial analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.\n\"It (Daiwa) could be a model for restructuring at other banks, which still lack a sense of crisis despite the recent fall in their share prices,\" she said.\nBy the end of March, 2000, Daiwa\"s restructuring efforts are likely to help boost its annual operating profits above 100 billion yen ($800 million), despite the negative impact of asset reductions overseas, Ohara said. In the year to March 1997 Daiwa forecast operating profits of 80 billion yen ($640 million).\nA Daiwa official agreed that the harm done by the bond-loss scandal was not as great as initially expected.\n\"We feared that we might suffer substantial damage from the withdrawal from U.S. markets,\" Daiwa bank director Akiyoshi Otani told Reuters in a recent interview. \"But the damage was not great..... Our customers stayed calm and have been supporting us.\"\n\"The strategies we have taken (since the withdrawal from the United States) have not been wrong,\" he added.\nIn November 1995, two months after news broke that a Daiwa trader in New York lost $1.1 billion on unauthorised deals, U.S. bank regulatory authorities ordered Daiwa to shut down its U.S. operations. Daiwa pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and fraud and paid a record $340 million in fines.\nJapan\"s Finance Ministry also placed temporary restrictions on Daiwa\"s operations and ordered the institution, Japan\"s ninth largest commercial bank, to work out a drastic streamlining programme.\nLast April, Daiwa announced a two-year plan to focus on its three strengths: the Kansai area around Osaka in western Japan, where it has a strong customer base, the Asian market, and the trust business, which includes pension fund management. Daiwa manages more pension fund money than any other Japanese bank.\nIt also decided to shut about 36 offices, including 16 overseas, by March 1999, and by the end of last September had cut its assets to 16.30 trillion yen ($130 billion) from 19.36 trillion yen ($154 billion) a year earlier. Daiwa also plans to reduce the number of its employees by about 2,000 by March 2000, from 9,151 last September.\nBut some analysts insisted the bank\"s restructuring had not gone far enough, noting it was still saddled with 790 billion yen ($6.32 billion) in problem loans, or 7.4 percent of loans outstanding, as of last September.\nYushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc\"s Tokyo branch, added that the expulsion from the United States was bound to damage Daiwa\"s future business.\n\"I doubt whether Daiwa can continue to manage its international business without U.S. operations,\" he said. \"The business environment surrounding Japanese banks will become much tougher and Daiwa must make extra efforts to streamline its business, even halving its assets.\"\nSeveral analysts have suggested that Daiwa\"s woes may force it to combine with another financial institution. Last month, Moody\"s Investors Service said Daiwa Bank and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, may join under the same holding company.\nBut Daiwa\"s Otani dismissed such talk for now.\n\"We should not forget that we are still in the process of recovering our creditworthiness..... Although there is talk about mergers or a holding company, this is not an issue for us at the moment,\" he said. ($=125 yen)", "Deere & Co. Tuesday reported record fourth-quarter and annual earnings as demand grew for its agricultural, industrial, commercial and consumer equipment worldwide.\nNet income jumped 15 percent to $173.9 million, or 68 cents a share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $150.6 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 7 percent to $2.9 billion from $2.7 billion.\n\"The company's operating margins remain strong as our focus on continuous improvement and growth is having a positive impact throughout our businesses,\" Deere Chairman Hans Becherer said in a statement.\nBut fourth quarter profits were less than some analysts had expected, although results did include a $15 million after-tax write-off to integrate and consolidate various Mexican operations.\nDeere's stock dropped $2.625 to $44 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\"Deere came in a little light on a reported basis,\" NatWest Markets analyst Thomas Burns said.\nProfits for the fiscal year rose 16 percent to $817.3 million, or $3.14 a share, from $706.1 million, or $2.71 a share, last year. Revenues climbed 9 percent to $11.2 billion from $10.3 billion.\nOne area of weakness was Deere's commercial and consumer equipment business, such as lawn and landscaping products.\nWorldwide commercial and consumer equipment operating profits fell to $1 million for the fourth quarter from $35 million last year, and to $118 million for the full fiscal year from $165 million a year ago. Deere blamed the drop on lower sales volume and increased promotional and growth expenditures.\n\"The one big operational shortfall that was very, very disappointing and was a surprise to us was the commercial and consumer business,\" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Blair Brumley said.\nMoline, Ill.-based Deere said export sales from the United States continued to grow, by 20 percent to $1.58 billion for 1996 from $1.31 billion last year.\nOverseas sales for the year remained very strong, rising by 26 percent to $2.75 billion, topping $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history, Deere said.\nWorldwide agricultural equipment operating profits jumped to $202 million for the fourth quarter from $135 million in the year-ago period.\nWorldwide demand for John Deere agricultural equipment remains very strong, Becherer said.\nOverseas agricultural equipment sales, which were strong during 1996, are expected to continue to increase in 1997 due to sales in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\nIndustrial equipment operating profit fell to $34 million for the fourth quarter from $36 million last year. Deere cited increased development expenses associated with improving the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of new engines.\nNet income of Deere's financial services subsidiaries was $47.6 million for the quarter vs. $41 million a year ago.\nLooking ahead, Deere said it expected worldwide physical volume of sales to dealers on a comparable basis to increase by about 5 percent in 1997 compared with 1996.", "The nation's distillers Thursday formally reversed their 48-year-old voluntary ban on broadcast advertising of liquor, saying whiskey and gin should be treated just like beer and wine.\nThe announcement -- coming two days after the presidential election and just ahead of the holiday season -- affirms the decision by Seagram Co. Ltd. in June to begin airing TV ads for its Royal Crown and Chivas Regal whiskey.\nThat ad campaign has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators and President Clinton. And the latest decision is sure to rachet up the debate.\n\"For decades, beer and wine have been advertised on television and radio while the distilled spirits industry has upheld its own voluntary ban,\" said Fred Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS).\n\"The absence of spirits from television and radio has contributed to the mistaken perception that spirits are somehow'harder' or worse than beer or wine and thus deserving of harsher social, political and legal treatment.\"\nThe reversal of the voluntary ban was adopted in DISCUS's \"code of good practice.\"\nThe announcement drew an immediate rebuke from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who has made it clear he is opposed to the practice and has raised the specter of new rules that would bar such advertising.\n\"This decision is disappointing for parents, and dangerous for our kids,\" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, whose agency has begun a probe of the ad campaign.\nConsumer advocates also objected. \"Today's decision by DISCUS to dump its voluntary ban marks the beginning of an open liquor-marketing season on America's children and teens,\" said George Hacker of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\nHe urged President Clinton to renew his appeal to distillers to return to the voluntary ban, and he called on the Federal Trade Commission to assist the FCC in its probe.\nIn Congress, Rep. Joseph Kennedy has offered legislation to make it illegal to advertise hard liquor on radio or TV.\nBroadcasters, meanwhile, criticized the distillers' decision but stopped short of refusing to run liquor ads.\nThe National Association of Broadcasters advocated to continue leaving the decision on whether to air the ads to individual TV and radio stations.\n\"We believe this process has served American consumers well, since individual stations make and will continue to make judgments every day on what is most appropriate for their local audiences,\" said NAB President Edward Fritts.", "British Telecommications beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.\nBT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create Concert, one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.\nBut after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) of redundancy costs and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below the corresponding 1995 figures.\nBT, whose shares were 8.5 pence higher at 369p in heavy trade after a high on the day of 371, managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.\n\"We're growing, we're not going backwards,\" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.\n\"I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world,\" he said. \"When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service, and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.\"\nThe group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.\nBut chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told a news conference BT was probably losing one to two percentage points of a growing British telecoms market, and that this trend was likely to continue, forcing BT to turn abroad for profit growth.\n\"BT will lose profits in the short term,\" said James Ross, telecoms analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, who expects BT to post a full year pretax profit of 2.1 billion pounds. But he said BT was well placed to fight competition at home and abroad.\n\"They are the group that has done the best (abroad) so far and in the UK, they have protected their position,\" he said.\nBrace said BT planned to \"get very aggressive\" in the next two years as European telecoms markets are opened around 1998.\nBT expects to win more than 30 percent of revenues from its six continental European joint ventures after liberalisation. Those ventures, worth about $135 billion, could start contributing profits after five to seven years, Bonfield said.\nThe group plans to take a substantial market share of the lucrative big business, data and mobile services markets.\nBonfield said BT, which expects 1996/97 capital expenditure to be around 2.7-2.8 billion pounds, still saw a link-up with a partner such as Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone a high, long-term priority for a ticket into booming Asia.\n\"I'd really hate to be knocked out by another competitor just because we weren't treading the boards,\" he said.\nWhile Japan was mulling the future structure of NTT, BT would make sure it was \"parading outside the door\", he said.\nBT operates in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. Another 3,200 staff left in the first half of this year with about 3,000 more voluntary redundancies expected this year.\nAsked whether BT planned similar deals to its $20 billion MCI merger, Brace said: \"I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with,\" he said.", "The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index rallied to close at a new all-time high of 6055 points on Tuesday, posting its first such record in 1997.\nThe influential index jumped 53.38 points to end at 6054.86 in brisk turnover of 129.3 million shares worth C$2.1 billion ($1.55 billion).\nIt busted through a previous record of 6018.65 points set on November 28, 1996, partly powered by a Wall Street rally.\nWall Street rose 53.11 points to close at 6762.29 on stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings from computer chip maker Intel Corp.

The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities, after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets.", "The federal government's bid to pry open the phone business has hit a snag that could postpone the onset of full-blown competition in the local and long-distance markets and delay cheaper phone service.\nThe snag came when a federal appeals court Tuesday suspended, or stayed, key parts of a Federal Communications Commission rule opening local phone monopolies to competition from long-distance carriers, cable TV operators and others.\nExperts said the action could postpone competition in the $100 billion local phone market now controlled by the regional Baby Bell phone companies, until the case makes its way through the courts in coming months. A final decision could easily take a year or more.\n\"We're in for a very messy 1997, and the dust won't settle until fairly deep into 1997,\" said Henry Geller, a former top telecommunications official in the Commerce Department.\nThat, in turn, could delay the Baby Bells' entrance into the $70 billion long-distance market. The telecommunications law enacted in February lets the Bells offer long-distance only after they have opened their own markets to new rivals.\nEven before the appeals court acted, government officials suggested a prolonged delay of the FCC's rules would make it tougher for regulators to allow the Bells to enter the long-distance business.\nThe FCC -- along with the Justice Department and state regulators -- has the final say over whether the Bells have satisfied a 14-point \"checklist\" that includes provisions of the now-suspended FCC rule.\n\"If the stay chills investment and retards new entry into the local marketplace, it may become more difficult for the (FCC) to authorise the Bell companies to offer long-distance (service),\" FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said in a speech only hours before the appeals court order.\nAnd she noted that the Justice Department -- whose views \"must be accorded'substantial weight'\" by the FCC -- already has signalled it will be reluctant to support Baby Bell entry as long as as the key parts of the FCC's proposed rules are on ice.\nDavid Turetsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's antitrust division, said last month a stay would \"seriously impair\" the Bell entry process spelled out in the telecommunications law.\nAny delays could delay the benefits of competition that Congress and President Clinton promised when enacting the law.\n\"The sooner there is competition in the local market, the consumer will benefit. And that's for sure when the Bells are allowed to go into long distance,\" said Geller.\n\"That will result in marketing and price wars. And the consumer again will greatly benefit.\"\nBut Baby Bell stocks rallied after the ruling because state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts when the companies lease their phone lines to new competitors, analysts said.\nGTE, the nation's largest local phone company -- which has spearheaded the legal challenge to the FCC rules -- jumped $3.625 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBellSouth added $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic gained $2.125 to $60.875, NYNEX rose $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech was up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis rose $1.28 to $34.66, all on the NYSE.\nThe appeals court suspended the FCC rule until the judges consider a challenge to the measure early next year by GTE Corp., the Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.\nThey argue the FCC overstepped its power by requiring the Bells and local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.\nThe court's action, for now, puts back in the hands of state regulators the responsibility to set such prices.\nBut local phone company officials discount the chance that competition will be delayed.\n\"The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed by Congress in February is the law of the land and sets forth a timetable for the introduction of competition,\" said GTE Senior Vice President William Barr. He said that timetable is \"unaffected\" by the court's action and will proceed.", "British electricity transmission business National Grid should report a rise in half year profits on November 26 and could explain how it will cope with new pricing controls that come into effect on April 1, 1997.\n\"We will be looking for indications on how they are going to cope, whether there will be any cost cutting,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nAnalysts expect National Grid's first half profits to range from 279 to 304 million stg, up from 278.9 million previously. A dividend payout of 4.45 to 4.9 pence per share is forecast.  \nThe company, which was floated in December 1995, capitulated in October to revised transmission pricing proposed by industry watchdog Offer which included a one-off reduction of 20 percent in the first year starting April 1, 1997.\nFor the following three years, price increases will be capped at four points below inflation.\nNational Grid had called Offer's original proposals of a one-off cut between 20 and 26 percent \"contrived, illogical and inconsistent.\"  \nThe company said when it accepted the revised controls that it would introduce further measures to improve efficiency but that the cuts would have \"a material impact on transmission business profitability.\"\n\"Does the review mean that its finances are going to be hit hard?\" asked the analyst. \"I feel it needs to justify its capitulation, which sold shareholders down the river,\" he added.\nNational Grid chief executive said at the time price cuts were agreed that he was confident of maintaining a \"progressive\" dividend policy but analysts said clearer indications would be welcomed.  \nThe market will also be watching for updates on progress in finding a partner for its Energis telecommunications service.\nEnergis said in October that it was on track to announcing a link with an international carrier within a year.\nEnergis made an operating loss of 72.8 million stg last year but expects to break even in 1999/2000.\nNational Grid shares were up 6p in late trade on Friday at 192p.", "House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at remaking the regulatory landscape for banking and other financial services in the United States.\nA similiar bill Leach introduced in the previous Congress foundered last June amid opposition from the insurance industry and House Democrats.  \nAnalysts have said this year's bill might have a better chance of passage, but that was before Leach decided to oppose Newt Gingrich's reelection as Speaker of the House, a move that could turn the leadership against his bill.\n\"This bill provides expanded powers for the banking, securities and insurance industries,\" Leach said in a statement. \"The ultimate beneficiaries of this legislation, however, are consumers.\"  \n\"Not only will there be more products available to banking customers who are looking to maximize their savings, but efficiencies should lower industry costs and therefore costs to consumers,\" Leach said.\nIf passed, the bill would break down the legal barriers enacted after the Great Depression between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.\nBank regulators have already begun eroding the barriers for banks, putting pressure on Congress to level the playing field, analysts said.  \nThe Federal Reserve voted Dec 20 to allow bank subsidiaries to garner a greater share of revenue from underwriting activity. And a month earlier, the Comptroller of the Currency's office said it would allow banks to enter an array of non-bank markets.\nLeach said his bill would repeal Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act and amend Section 32 to allow for the merger of commercial and investment banks.  \nBank subsidiaries would be allowed to engage directly in securities dealing and other activities considered \"part of and incidental to\" banking. Affiliates of bank holding companies, would be allowed to engage in insurance activities as principal, agent or broker.\nThe bill would also abolish the federal charter for thrifts while grandfathering existing thrift holding companies. National thrifts would have the option of transferring to a national or state bank charter or a state savings and loan charter.\nThe Iowa Republican's bill would continue to prohibit commercial companies outside the finance sector from owning banks.\nThe bill was also sponsored by three other Republican members of the Banking Committee: Rep Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Mike Castle of Delaware and Rick Lazio of New York.\nThe full committee will hold hearings on the bill and any related legislation in early March, Leach said.\nThe text of Leach's bill is available under the \"daily update\" section of the Banking Committee's World Wide Web site, http://www.house.gov/banking/.", "The keys to WorldCom Inc's $14 billion takeover of MFS Communications Co Inc are savings on duplicated costs and a chance to be the first with end-to-end service in U.S. businesses telecommunications.\nWorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers acknowledged that there was a substantial premium in the stock terms offered for MFS but said savings would soon cover the cost of the deal.\n\"It is not to say that price isn't important, but it really depends on how quickly you pay for it,\" Ebbers told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  \nMFS, with local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities, was in a unique position to outflank the regional Bell's lock on access to local business customers. It was in a position to get the terms it wanted.\n\"There aren't a lot of MFS's out there,\" Ebbers said.\n\"He (Ebbers) had the only one sizeable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),\" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.\nWorldCom stock soared a heady 57 percent a year over the last ten years. MFS has grown 41 percent a year in the three years since it was floated.  \nEbbers said savings and new market opportunities would mean the deal would pay for itself within five or six years, though for the first three years, 1997-1999, earnings per share would be diluted, but solidly accretive thereafter.\nWorries that the stock transaction was too generous for MFS hit Worldcom stock, which was 3-3/4 or 15 percent lower at 22-5/8 in early afternoon. MFS soared 10 to 44-7/8, with both atop the active shares list on Nasdaq.\nEbbers said communicating the deal's advantages may take time. \"If that happens we will have a significantly increased stock price from where we are today,\" he said.  \nUUNET, the internet service provider which MFS completed buying earlier this month, will have the biggest savings.\nNow it can provide both local and long distance connections without having to pay fees on outside networks.

The chief prosecutor's office was unavailable for comment on the latest detention.\nUSO head Hernando Hernandez said last Thursday the union would fix the \"zero hour\" for the start of an indefinite strike to protest the wave of arrests at an extraordinary assembly Monday. The action is also to oppose government plans for what the union sees as the creeping privatization of state-run oil company Ecopetrol, Hernandez said.\nFollowing a merger between the 5,700-strong USO and smaller oil workers' associations, the strike could spread to the private sector, including foreign multinationals operating in Colombia.\nUSO leaders were due to meet Colombian Interior Minister Horacio Serpa Sunday evening to discuss the arrest of members and the planned walkout. The government seems likely to declare an oil workers' strike illegal on the grounds that it is affecting a key sector of the economy.\nMines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar said Friday that Ecopetrol had enough fuel reserves to meet demand for 19 days and said any shortfalls in domestic supply could be made up by increasing imports in the event of a USO strike.\nA 24-hour stoppage by USO workers in mid-October paralyzed pumping -- 350,000 barrels a day -- along the country's two main oil pipelines for the first time ever.\nIn a separate incident in the oil town of Barrancabermeja, two unidentified assailants blasted local USO official Gilberto Carreno at close range with a shotgun and wounded as he left a bar Saturday morning.\nUSO social services secretary Gustavo Triana the motives for the attack were unclear.

However, I should say that the first quarter may not be quite up to those expectatations, but we will certainly be striving to make up any shortfall,\" Murdoch said.\nAnalysts viewed the comments as disappointing and said they were now more sceptical about the 20 percent profit pledge.\n\"If they can't meet expectations in the first quarter, when they have those strong revenues from'Independence Day,\" then what hope do they have of getting 20 percent in the full year?\" asked one Sydney-based media analyst referring to a hit Hollywood movie made by News Corp's Fox studio.\nTraders on the Australian share market did not like the first quarter comment either, selling the shares 14 cents or almost two percent lower to close at A$7.20 ($5.69), while the broader Australian stock market closed at a record high.\nIn the 1995/96 year ended June 30, News Corp's net profit slipped to A$1.02 billion ($806 million) from A$1.37 billion in 1994/95 ($1.08 billion).\nMurdoch said revenues at the Fox U.S. television business had begun 1996/97 slowly because of of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the rights to which were held by a rival network.\nAustralian newspaper revenues would be flat in 1996/97, said Murdoch.\nBut he remained buoyant about News' British operations, saying the advertising market there was booming and the partly-owned BSkyB pay television operation was growing strongly.\nMurdoch then unveiled a more cautious strategy for financing future expansion.\n\"As far as possible, we will finance them (News' expansion plans) out of current cash flow to maintain liquidity so that we will be ready to take new opportunities as they arise,\" he said.\nNews has often funded its aggressive growth in pay television and other media through either hefty debt or equity issues, which have sometimes met shareholder resistance. It almost collapsed under a debt mountain in the early 1990s.", "Lotus Development Corp. Chief Executive Officer Michael Zisman said Wednesday the company will focus its attention on what could become a $1 billion market for collaborative Internet software by 1999.\nLotus, acquired by International Business Machines Corp. last year in a deal valued at more than $3 billion, should not try to be all things to all people, he said, but to concentrate its core business of software for groups, or so-called groupware.\n\"Collaboration is clearly our sweet spot,\" he said in a keynote address at a three-day Internet & Electronic Commerce conference here organised by the Gartner Group.\nA new version of the company's popular Lotus Notes software due out in the fourth quarter, version 4.5, will offer Notes server software to host collaboration over the Internet. Servers are computers that manage the flow of data in a network.\nThis latter feature is provided by new Lotus technology dubbed Domino, which is currently being tested.\nZisman said too much attention was now devoted to browsers, software that lets users help navigate the Internet.\n\"The browser market is being eclipsed by the server market today as we speak,\" he said, noting browsers will most likely be offered as part of the operating system, as with Windows.\n\"The action, I believe, is going to be in the server market,\" he said, adding that server software for collaboration through Internet sites alone is projected to be a $1 billion market by the end of the decade.\nThe market for servers at the hub of Web sites will likely segment into at least three distinct classes -- content, collaboration and commerce -- and larger organisations will likely mix \"best of breed\" applications from different suppliers, he said.\nLotus Development is concentrating helping people work together electronically, he said, because \"content without collaboration is useless.... the value is not in the content.\"\nHe noted as an example Web sites which not only carried information, but enabled people to communicate interactively with the Web site or other individuals using the Internet.\n\"The borders are blurry. I don't believe that we will see pure content sites and I don't believe that we will see pure commerce sites,\" he said. \"We will obtain and retain customers if we engage them.\"", "Long distance and local telephone company Frontier Corp. said on Monday it is investing up to $500 million in a $2 billion fiber optic network being built across the United States.\nFrontier said it will be the largest fiber optic network built in the United States as a single project, and will put it ahead of AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and others whose networks include both old and new technologies.\nLucent Technologies Inc., spun off from AT&T Corp. in September, will supply the network cable. That contract is worth at least $100 million, a source close to the deal said.\nThe network is being built by privately owned Qwest Communications, which began work in 1995 and has already spent $500 million. Qwest said it is open to other telecommunications partners to help fund the remaining $1 billion.\nThe network will connect almost 100 cities and use the technical standard known as SONET, or Synchronous Optical Network, which gives high performance and reliability.\n\"Used in a ring, SONET allows you to recover from a network failure in milliseconds,\" said analyst Christine Heckart of consultants TeleChoice. \"This investment will expand Frontier's network reach to customers it was hard to get at low cost,\" she said.\nFrontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., currently leases its network from others. But it expects to be able to cut costs significantly by this investment, which will increase its network capacity forty-fold.\nRobert Barrett, president of Frontier's Network Systems unit, said the network would begin to bring benefits in 1997, halving network transport costs, and cutting incremental network costs by 80 percent.\n\"Clearly it makes better sense for us to own the network,\" Barrett told a teleconference.\nQwest, a company specializing in network construction, is based in Denver, Colo. It is a subsidiary of Anschutz Co. Anschutz's owner and chief executive is Philip Anschutz, the largest shareholder in Union Pacific Corp.\nFrontier will fund $350 million to $400 million of its investment from its own cash flow, and may use short- and medium-term debt for the remaining $100 million to $150 million.\nFrontier's stock lost 25 cents to end at $27.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.", "British bank Barclays Tuesday sold its global custody business to investment bank Morgan Stanley for an undisclosed sum thought to be less than 50 million British pounds ($83 million).\nThe purchase by Morgan Stanley marks another step in the consolidation of custody business, which is increasingly being seen as a banking activity where \"big is beautiful.\"\nThe custody business includes traditional safekeeping of securities, increasingly electronically, performance measurement and stock lending.\n\"Barclays believes global custody has become very much a.... business requiring substantial investment in technology,\" said Chief Executive Martin Taylor.\nA Barclays spokeswoman said the investment in technology would be considerable and that Barclays had decided this would not be an effective investment.\nSir David Walker, chairman of Morgan Stanley Europe, said, \"This transaction enables us to offer a broader range of products to our clients. It will strengthen Morgan Stanley's global franchise, particularly in Europe, and will increase our fee-based revenues.\"\nMorgan Stanley said the combined custody assets of the two business would amount to some $390 million, taking it up the global custody ladder dominated by large American players.\nThe list is headed by Chase Manhattan, which has more than $1 trillion in assets in custody, followed by Citibank, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank, the largest European player, and State Street Boston.\nBarclays had Britain's largest custody business, followed by Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland.\nBarclays Global Custody employs some 488 staff members worldwide, of which only those in sales, relationship management, marketing and client support will be moving to Morgan Stanley -- considerably fewer than half of the total.\nBarclays employee union UNIFI said only 67 of the staff would transfer with the business.\nAnalysts said Morgan Stanley was thought to have paid less than 50 million pounds ($83 million) for the business, but the banks said a final price would not be fixed for some time.

A margin squeeze resulted.\n\"This year there may be room for a little bit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make it possible for these companies to restore margins to previous levels,\" Keaney said.\nCiting small premium rises so far in the January renewal period, Hoehn said: \"Uncertainties regarding profitability will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996.\"  \nU.S. FIRST CALL CONSENSUS QTRLY EARNINGS FORECASTS\nCompany\t\t\t\tQtr   EPS estimate   Yr-ago EPS\nFoundation Health\t Q2\t $0.64\t   $0.72\nHumana\t\t     Q4\t $0.21\t   $0.30\nMid Atlantic Medical   Q4\t($0.02)\t  $0.33\nOxford Health\t\t\tQ4\t $0.36\t   $0.21\nPacifiCare Health\t\t  Q1\t $0.99\t   $0.88\nPhysicians Health     Q4\t($0.43)\t  $0.42\nSierra Health\t    Q4\t $0.59\t   $0.59\nUnited Healthcare\tQ4\t $0.48\t   $0.57\nHealthsource\t\tQ4\t $0.10\t   $0.22\nNOTE: Parentheses indicate loss.", "Seven of Japan's eight biggest life insurers said on Wednesday that they experienced a drop in assets in the first half of the current fiscal year, the first such fall in many years.\nExecutives attributed the decline to a cancellation of pension fund management contracts after the firms cut their guaranteed rate of return in April.\n\"It was the first time we have seen a drop in assets since we started announcing our interim business reports (six years ago),\" said Taichi Ohtaki, managing director of Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. \"It would probably be the first time we have experienced a decline in our assets since World War Two.\"\nCombined assets at the eight firms totalled 142.8 trillion yen ($1.26 trillion) at the end of September, down 1.2 percent from 144.6 trillion yen ($1.27 trillion) at the end of March.\nOnly Nippon Life Insurance Co, the biggest life insurer in Japan, increased its assets -- to 39.44 trillion yen ($349 billion) from 39.03 trillion yen ($345 billion).\nThe other firms are Meiji Life Insurance, Sumitomo Life Insurance, Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance, Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance, Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance and Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance.\nAssets of the eight account for about 75 percent of the total assets held by all Japanese life insurers.\nThe executives said that some corporate pension funds and the Pension Welfare Service Public Corp (PWSPC) -- an affiliate of the Welfare Ministry -- had cancelled fund management contracts in the first half of 1996/97, due to a cutback in the guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers to 2.5 percent from 4.5 percent.\nThe PWSPC said earlier this year that it had cancelled about five trillion yen ($44.2 billion) worth of fund management contracts with 18 life insurers.\nHowever, some insurers were optimistic and said the decline in assets was only a temporary phenomenon.\n\"I think the cancellation of pension funds peaked out in the first half and assets at the end of next March will likely recover to the same level as at the end of last fiscal year,\" said Minoru Mochida, senior managing director at Meiji Life.\nAnalysts said that despite the decline in assets, the profitability of the insurers was improving.\nA serious headache for the insurers has been the negative spread between current low investment yields and already promised payouts, they said. Since the cancellation of pension fund management contracts, the gap has been narrowing.\nThe payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.\nMeiji Life's Mochida said the overall average guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers would fall to about four percent in 1996/97 from about five percent in 1995/96, while investment yields would remain low at around three percent.\nThe eight firms also announced a combined 2.15 trillion yen ($19.0 billion) of problem loans as of the end of September, the first time they had revealed such statistics.\nThey said that at the end of September the amount of this total classified as \"bad loans\" -- loans to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears of six months or more -- was 1.06 trillion yen ($9.3 billion).", "Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said Monday.\nThe share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.\nRumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.\nWhile the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.\n\"The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,\" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.\n\"Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,\" he added.\nBeijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.\n\"The action has cooled speculative activity for now,\" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. \"But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.\"\nIn the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called \"rubbish shares\" that have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.\nAnalysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.\nOne key problem of the Chinese stock markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.\n\"With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,\" said one analyst.\nThe draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon, due partly to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.\nResponsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.\nShanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.\nIn Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.", "Britain's commercial television watchdog on Thursday invited applications to run terrestrial frequencies which will multiply the number of channels available to viewers in the new digital age.\n\"This is a very important day for UK viewers...as many as 35 or 36 channels could be available on digital terrestrial television,\" said Peter Rogers, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission (ITC).\nThe ITC is seeking applications to operate four \"multiplexes\", as the blocks of frequencies are known. Each block can carry as many as six digital channels.\nThe BBC has already been earmarked its own multiplex, and commercial networks ITV and Channel 4 will share one.\nThe ITC will award the 12-year licences on critieria including speed of roll-out of the service and the appeal of programming but a cash bid will not be required. Licences are expected to be awarded next spring and broadcasting could begin by mid-1998.\nBritain is leading the way in the development of digital terrestrial but some observers question whether it will succeed.\nPay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the largest shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service into Britain in late 1997 -- several months ahead of the terrestrial version.\nThe satellite version could offer several hundred channels and BSkyB's control of key movie and sporting rights are likely to make it an attractive proposition.\nThe ITC's Rogers told a news conference he was confident the terrestrial option would prove attractive to investors.\n\"I would be surprised and disappointed if we didn't have applications for all of the multiplexes,\" he said.\nHis view was shared by Paul Styles, a media expert at consultancy and accounting firm KPMG.\n\"Most people perceive digital bandwith to be valuable so I think there will be interest in the multiplexes,\" he said.\n\"This will not be an overnight sensation but a business to be built,\" he said, identifying ITV companies, cable groups and BSkyB itself as potential licence applicants.\nDigital technology increases the number of channels which can be transmitted and enhances sound and picture quality. it also enables interactive services such as home shopping and home banking to be created.\nDigital means converting sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones -- rather than transmitting them as electric signals as now happens. A set-top box or \"decoder\" will be required to receive digital services.\nThis is also a source of controversy, as ITC officials admit that there is no current UK or European legislation to enforce a common standard for decoders.\nThat means that consumers could theoretically have to pay several hundred pounds (dollars) for a set-top box to receive BSkyB's digital services and then have to buy a second box a few months later to receive digital terrestrial.\nBritish Labour Euro MP Carole Tongue on Thursday wrote to European Commissioner Martin Bangemann to demand that all set-top boxes provide a common interface for all broadcasters.", "Gareth Davies, chief executive of British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco, which de-merged from conglomerate Hanson in October, said on Thursday it was difficult to see growth in Britain, although it hoped to make this up by expansion in the Asia- Pacific region.\n\"In Britian it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,\" he said.  \nEarlier, Imperial posted profits of 303 million stg from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.\nBritain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November Budget. After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent to 81 billion.\nDavies said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.", "An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network.\nThe Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue.\nUnveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names.\n\"There just seems to be no consensus at all,\" said Don Heath, president of the society. A variety of objections and questions have been raised about the August proposal, from technical networking issues to concerns about protection for trademarks and intellectual property.\n\"We thought we should try to pull it all together and have a good cross-section of people to discuss it and see if we can't reach a consensus,\" he said.\nThe new committee ought to finish its work by early next year and new names could be doled out four to six months later, Heath said. The committee could decide not to go forward with any address expansion, but Heath said that was an unlikely outcome.\n\"The facts of life are that people want descriptive names and vanity plates,\" Heath said.\nDisputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net.\nFor example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered \"mtv.com,\" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.\nEvery site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including \"com\" for private sites, \"gov for government sites and \"edu\" for sites run by schools.\nIn August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category.\nThe authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards.\nThe society's board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out.\nBut with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said. The committee will meet confer mostly by telephone and online, though an open forum is planned for mid-December in California.\nThe committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board.\nThe International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member.", "Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals rather than political influences.\nAnalysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further movement should be seen.\n\"Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,\" Jay King, of Wood and Company, said on Thursday.\nIn last weekend's voting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.\nThe opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.\nOnly 35 percent of the electorate voted in the elections.\nOf the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates were to go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.\nAnalysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course.\n\"Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,\" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.\nFollowing last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.\nBut dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.\nThe crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.\nSome analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.\n\"There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,\" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. \"There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.\"\nCitibank's Maly added: \"I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.\"", "Transport and logistics group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday it was well placed for quite strong profit growth in the current 1996/97 year, but would continue to look at selling its currently unprofitable non-core assets.\n\"We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,\" TNT Managing Director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.  \nMortimer said the non-core activities that slowed down TNT's earnings in 1995/96 were its general freight business in Australia and its Brazilian operations.\n\"We've dealt with the LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed and we've sold Brazil,\" he said.\n\"What's the saying...when in doubt shoot it or fix it.\"\nTNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said.\n\"We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform then they will be vulnerable to sale,\" he said.  \nOne of those non core activities is TNT's 50 percent interest in airliner leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide. News Corp Ltd owns the other half.\nMortimer said he had consistently said that Ansett Worldwide's capital base needed to be restructured to give it cheaper access to capital so it could compete properly.\n\"In its present structure, it's difficult for it to be optimised for News and TNT ownership because it needs access to capital at an effective rate,\" he said.\nNews and TNT continued to look at ways of restructuring Ansett Worldwide's capital base before selling it, he said.  \nAnsett's GD Express operation based in Europe had turned around in the last year and was now going well, Mortimer said.\nHe said the just completed sale plans for Ansett Airlines\nMortimer said in the longer term, TNT aimed to get double digit revenue and earnings growth.\n\"Overall we'd like to do good double digit (revenue and earnings) growth, but we can't guarantee any of that,\" he said.\nTNT's share price closed up three cents at A$1.47.", "Czech  Ceska Rafinerska a.s. closed a cracking unit at its Litvinov refinery on Monday after the second fire in eight days struck the plant, company spokesman Ales Soukup said.\nBut he said the restoration of crude processing, which was halted after the first fire, would continue.\nA fire broke out on Sunday night in a furnace of a cracking unit as crude flow resumed after an eight-day stoppage.\nOil flow had been halted since a blaze in another part of the refinery began on November 23 and lasted for more than two days. The latest fire was put out several hours after it started.\nSoukup told Reuters that the current resumption of production at the refinery would continue as crude is diverted around the cracker.\nThe shutdown of the cracker would limit the content, not the amount, of processed crude, Soukup said.\n\"This (cracking) unit will be out of order for some time, and therefore the refinery will operate in a substitution regime. It will affect the depth of processing,\" he said.\nThe extent of damage at the refinery, near the northern town of Litvinov, has not yet been determined. Soukup said reopening the cracker \"was not a question of hours or days.\"\nAn explosion in the refinery's tanking station on November 23 sent flames visible for several kilometres into the air and caused dense smoke to roll into neighbouring Germany.\nSoukup said the causes and damage from both fires were under investigation.\nAfter the earlier fire, officials from Rafinerska, petrol firms and the government decided that supplies from the Kralupy refinery and in the distribution network were sufficient in the short term, and state reserves would not be tapped.\nIn a deal completed last year, the IOC consortium of three foreign oil groups bought a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska, a company set up to operate the two main Czech refineries at Litvinov and Kralupy.\nThe IOC is equally owned by DuPont Co unit Conoco of the United States, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Italy's Agip SpA.\nThe state holds the remaining 51 percent stake in Rafinerska through the holding company Unipetrol a.s..", "Japan, worried about being isolated in global capital markets, is working to harmonise its domestic accounting standards with international methods.\nFinance Ministry (MOF) officials and analysts say Japan must comply with international accounting methods amid growing criticism that it is difficult to calculate how much risk a Japanese firm holds.\n\"To raise funds in international capital markets, financial statements of Japanese firms must be accepted by foreign investors,\" said an official in MOF's securities bureau.\nNaruaki Sonoda, Nikko Research Centre's senior analyst, says: \"It is needed to harmonise Japanese standards with international ones as it is costly for Japanese firms which want to raise funds overseas to have to make two financial statements based on domestic and international standards.\"\nLast month, an advisory body to the ministry started a two-year discussion into whether and how far mark-to-market accounting should be used for companies' financial products holdings, such as securities and derivatives, as well as corporate pension fund accounts.\nIn mark-to-market accounting, unrealised gains or losses from financial products holdings must be stated in balance sheets and included in income statements.\nIn Japan, financial products are fundamentally appraised according to the cost of purchase, and only realised gains or losses need to be posted when positions are closed, regardless of the size of the open position a corporation is holding.\nGrowing financial assets at Japanese corporations and a series of trading fiascos by Japanese firms in the past year has prompted Japanese authorities to set tougher accounting rules.\nAt the end of March 1995, securities holdings at Japanese corporations, excluding financial industries, totalled 50.11 trillion yen ($463 billion) based on book value, accounting for 16 percent of their total assets, NRC's Sonoda said.\nThis compared with 21.15 trillion yen ($195 billion) of securities holdings at the end of March 1985, which accounted for 11 percent of their total assets.\nHuge losses stemming from securities and derivatives trading have raised criticism for lax Japanese corporate risk management and accounting methods.\nEarlier this year, Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp announced it had lost $1.8 billion through unauthorised trading in copper futures.\nLast November, Daiwa Bank said it lost $1.1 billion in unauthorised bond trading at its now-closed New York office.\nThe MOF also announced last month that it would tighten rules on corporate disclosure, highlighting that corporations will have to disclose unlisted derivatives trading such as swap trading, based on market prices, beginning in April 1998.\nListed derivatives, which are already calculated at market values, cover futures and options traded at the securities exchanges. Unlisted derivatives include swap trading such as interest-rate swaps.\nThe new rules do not affect corporate balance sheets, but disclosing the data is a step towards introducing mark-to-market accounting for financial products holdings.\nJapan is working toward using international standards, said Hirokazu Moriyama, general manager at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities & Economics.\n\"I expect Japan to introduce international accounting standards by the end of the fiscal 1998/1999, as the European Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States have stated their support for the IASC process in setting international accounting standards,\" Moriyama said.\nIASC, the International Accounting Standards Committee, has been working out principles of international accounting rules that can be applied in consistent ways in different countries.\nIt is expected to complete the process by March 1998.\nThe International Organisation of Securities Commissions, comprised of governmental securities authorities, including Japan, decided in July last year that it would take steps towards accepting IASC accountancy proposals.\nSonoda said, however, it was still unclear how far Japan would go in adopting mark-to-market methods in securities holdings and derivatives trading.\nThe United States basically uses the mark-to-market appraisal for securities holdings.\nSonoda says if international accounting standards follow the U.S. method, the impact would be enormous on Japanese corporations.\n\"Japanese companies own huge amounts of stocks in unique cross holdings, and they have massive unrealised profits on those holdings as they bought the shares a long time ago at cheap prices.\"\nIf those hidden profits are appraised in balance sheets, the boost in assets would deteriorate the return on equity (ROE) at Japanese companies.\nROE is a common financial yardstick, showing how efficiently a company is using its capital.\n\"This may reveal how poorly Japanese companies make use of shareholders' capital...\" Sonoda said.\nCurrently, the ROE for Japanese companies is about 3.8 percent, compared with more than 10 percent for U.S. companies.", "Kellogg Co. on Friday reported a drop of more than 30 percent in its third quarter profits as its cereal volume dropped in an intensely competitive market.\nKellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special-K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales.\n\"We'll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions,\" Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said.\nThe company, the world's biggest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to $159.5 million, including a $21.3 million charge, from $230 million a year ago. On a per share basis, Kellogg's earnings dropped 29 percent to 75 cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from $1.05 last year.\nKellogg said its overall sales slipped 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.84 billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume.\n\"As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category,\" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.\nAnalysts estimate that Kellogg's domestic cereal sales volume fell 9 percent to 10 percent in the third quarter.\n\"We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down,\" Lovell added.\nKellogg said its fourth quarter 1996 earnings likely will show a slight rise from the 77 cents it earned a year ago. First quarter 1997 earnings, however, may not match the 99 cents earned in the 1996 period.\n\"It's a challenging comparison,\" Lovell said.\nKellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook for earnings, dropping $1 at $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new 52-week low of $64.125.\nKellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets.\nLooking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter.\nAnalysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant to return to deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways.\n\"It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do,\" SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.\n\"There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions,\" added BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.\nKellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump-start consumer purchases.\nBut those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.\n\"The message there is that prices have to come down further,\" Rabinowitz said.\nAccording to Information Resources data, U.S. ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the 52 weeks ended Aug. 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier.\nKellogg's sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.", "Germany and the Czech republic will initial a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation between their two states on Friday in Prague, the Czech foreign ministry said on Monday.\nA ceremony ending the two-year-long talks on the text will be held with Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Germany's Klaus Kinkel in the first part of a three-stage confirmation.\nThe ministry said in a statement that the two would \"sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development\".\nThe full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from former Czechoslovakia.\nThe text angered groups representing families of expelled Germans, known as Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who lost property during the expulsions.\nBut the Christian Social Union (CSU), the political sponsors of the Sudeten Germans, signalled on Monday it would no longer oppose the agreed text.\n\"By and large, the declaration will stand,\" Finance Minister and CSU chairman Theo Waigel told reporters.\nThe Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.\nBut Waigel said it was a \"great success\" that Prague had gone as far as it had in apologising for the expulsions.\nIn the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.\nMembers of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.\n\"(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),\" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.\nStanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.\nThe declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.\nThe text says the fund is to finance \"projects of common interest\" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.\nBut the text adds that: \"The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.\"\nDiplomats said privately that the signing ceremony might take place somewhere outside Prague, but Czech officials said last week it would not take place in those areas which Germany annexed in 1938, known as the Sudetenland.\nPrague is not part of the area Germany considered as the Sudetenland.\nGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nIn early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.", "Intense haggling among the world's trade ministers brought within grasp a lucrative deal to free the global information technology market and some officials saw movement on the contentious issue of labour standards.\nBig powers, notably the United States and the European Union (EU), said on Tuesday a flurry of talks throughout the second day of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference had inched toward a global pact to eliminate tariffs on a $600 billion market for information technology.\nStorm-clouds over whether to discuss monopolistic business practices began to disperse. Differences appeared to narrow between North and South as well as North and North on standards to regulate cheap labour and child workers.\nWTO officials want a final declaration at the close of the first ministerial meeting of the fledgling trade body on Friday that would point the WTO down the free trade path into the 21st century.\nThe EU, along with the United States, Canada and Japan, were making progress to reach consensus on an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) that would be the crowning achievement of the meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters.\n\"We are making a lot of progress,\" Brittan said after a lunchtime meeting of the four major trading partners to discuss types of products to be covered and timing of tariff reductions.\nActing U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy said she concurred with Brittan's comments, but declined to say anything more on the proposed pact to remove tariffs on computer products by 2000.\nLate night talks focused on details, officials said.\n\"There is no question that what the industrialised countries now hope for most here is a deal on information technology products and agreement to work hard for a basic telecommunications pact by February,\" said one key negotiator.\nSignals from negotiators left little doubt the major traders were aiming for agreement as quickly as possible -- perhaps by Wednesday -- to convince Asian trading partners to sign on to the agreement by the end of the meeting on Friday.\nJapan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the conference he hoped \"ardently....that we will have an agreement as the most significant achievement of this ministerial conference in the area of trade liberalisation.\"\nHowever, several Asian nations voiced reservations, with Malaysia saying the goal of free commerce in infotech by the turn of the century was too ambitious.\n\"We did not come here to discuss the Information Technology Agreement,\" international trade and industry minister Rafidah Aziz said. \"All negotiations should be done in Geneva.\"\nThe 128 full delegations from WTO member countries and ministers and officials from nearly 30 others waiting to be admitted heard ringing appeals for progress to a telecoms liberalisation pact with a deadline set for mid-February.\nAnother late night meeting was called on the \"new issue\" of labour standards that has emerged as the most divisive in Singapore.\nA Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters that some developing countries who had opposed any mention of the labour issue in the final declaration were taking a more positive position.\n\"A possibility of an agreement has emerged,\" he said, but addded that some hard-core emerging economies were holding out.\nIndia, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, have been insisting on no mention at all, arguing that even a neutral phrasing would suggest work conditions were a subject for the WTO.\nAccord was also closer on whether to study competition policy.\n\"No one was totally opposed to taking up the issue,\" a Japanese official sid. \"We are moving towards a compromise.\"\nAiming to counter lobbying by sceptical Western-based aid groups, the WTO insisted that the poorest nations stood to reap major benefit from the freeing of global commerce.\nBut WTO officials admitted that Director-General Renato Ruggiero had failed to convince richer members, both industrialised and emerging economies, to remove all tariffs and other barriers affecting goods from the laggard states.\nThe European Union made little headway in efforts to persuade its main trading partners to jump-start stalled talks on China's bid for WTO admission.\nBut Russia, another major member-in-waiting, expected to win entry by the end of 1997, Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said.", "CompuServe Corp., acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, said Thursday it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and focus on its business and technical customers.\nThe world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.\nThe company said it would pursue businesses with higher profit margins, including international consumer markets, espcially those in Europe.\n\"For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,\" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.\n\"CompuServe will never contend for the king's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,\" he said.\nCompuServe officials stressed no layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total head count stands at about 3,200 worldwide.\nThe company laid off 150 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, in an earlier cutback announced last summer.\nCompuServe's moves come on the heels of recent aggressive actions by rival America Online Inc. to stay on top by offering a series of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95, and by shutting down its direct Internet access service.\nSince CompuServe's parent, H&R Block Inc., sold 20 percent of the online service to the public in April, CompuServe has struggled to keep up with America Online, the largest online service, and with a host of Internet-based competitors.\nAmerica Online has more than 7 million subscribers. As of Oct. 31, CompuServe said it had 3.3 million direct worldwide subscribers. NiftyServe, its Japanese licensee, had a total of 5.3 million, roughly the same level as in July.\nIn reaction to CompuServe's continuing troubles, H&R Block in August shelved plans to spin off the 80 percent of CompuServe it still owns.\nSince CompuServe's initial public stock offering in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from an initial price of $30 a share. The stock fell 94 cents Thursday to $10.69 on Nasdaq.\nEarlier Thursday, H&R reported a substantial loss for its second quarter ended Oct. 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil.\nKrasilovsky said CompuServe's plan to go back to basics was \"very realistic,\" but added \"too bad they didn't do it a year-and-a-half ago.\"\nThe analyst said he expects the company to reposition itself to provide niche services to business customers who don't want to pay for a high-level premium online service.\nIn a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway said that while his company was abandoning further mass-marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, \"If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.\"\nNontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would target its efforts and investments at business and professional users, its traditional strength.\nWow! was introduced seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. Wow! customers numbered 102,000 at latest count, the company said.\nThe company blamed the failure of Wow! on new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.\nThe company also said it plans to launch early next year a new \"CompuServe for Business\" service, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new interface and added content from \"thousands\" of information providers.\nDespite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas where CompuServe's brand is the best recognised name among online and Internet access providers.\nIn Europe, for example, CompuServe said subscribers to its main CompuServe Interactive online service had nearly doubled to more than 800,000 in the past year.", "Pall Corp and Memtec Ltd may have different reasons, but they seem equally determined to acquire Gelman Sciences Inc.\nAnalysts and arbitrageurs were reluctant to say whether that portends an all-out bidding war, especially after a rally in American Depositary Shares of Memtec on Thursday that reflected some doubt on Wall Street of Memtec's commitment.\nStill, Gelman would nicely complement the operations of either suitor and will likely be hotly pursued by both, filtration industry analysts said.  \nShares in Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Gelman closed up 3 at 29 on the American Stock Exchange on the news that it was in discussions with Pall about a possible acquisition.\nGelman reached a definitive agreement on August 30 to be acquired by Australia's Memtec, which said Thursday it intends to proceed with the agreement.\n\"I don't think Memtec is going to back away,\" said Robert W. Baird & Co analyst Walter Morris.\nMemtec wants Gelman's sophisticated membrane technology to put Memtec into closer competition with East Hills, N.Y.-based Pall and Millipore Corp, Morris said. \nPall -- much larger than either Gelman or Memtec -- wants Gelman to broaden Pall's medical and process businesses and \"frankly, to eliminate a pesky competitor,\" Morris said.\nGelman sales in fiscal 1996 ended July 31 were $112 million, versus $103.5 million in fiscal 1995. Memtec sales in the year ended June 30 were $175 million, up from $145 million in fiscal 1995. Pall had revenues of $960.3 million in fiscal 1996 ended August 3, up from $822.2 million in fiscal 1995.\n\"Pall under chief executive Eric Krasnoff has been more acquisitive than under previous management teams,\" said Morgan Stanley & Co analyst Mark Gulley.  \n\"If he does this deal, it will have been his third acquisition\" since taking the helm at Pall about two years ago, Gulley said.\nKrasnoff's acquisitions have tended to broaden Pall's presence in existing markets, rather than move it into new areas -- a pattern into which a Gelman acquisition would fit, said Fourteen Research analyst Anthony Ginsberg.\n\"There's good overlap.... They're in many of the same venues and markets,\" Gulley said.\nMorris said, \"Gelman is strategically important to both companies.\"\nArbitrageurs seemed to cast doubt Thursday on Memtec's contention that it plans to proceed with the Gelman deal by bidding up the Australian company's American depository shares as much as 3-5/8 in the morning. They lost ground in the afternoon to close up 1-15/16 at 28-15/16.\nThe rally in part was likely explained by short covering, arbitrageurs said.\nLate Thursday, Gelman issued a statement saying it intended to pursue its agreement with Memtec, but also to talk with Pall and any other interested parties.", "Silver King Communication's $1.27 billion stock-swap acquistion of Home Shopping Network hastens Silver King's plans to become a conventional broadcast-TV powerhouse, Silver King said on Monday.\nThe deal re-uniting Silver King, spun off by Home Shopping five years ago, with its former parent also feeds speculation that Silver King chairman Barry Diller is closer to launching a seventh U.S. television network.\nVeteran entertainment-industry executive Diller led the 1980s launch of News Corp Ltd's Fox network.  \nSilver King spokesman Jason Stewart said Diller had no firm plans to launch a network and intended for now to reprogram Silver King's 12 stations carrying Home Shopping Network with conventional, locally oriented shows.\n\"With most stations emphasizing national and syndicated programs, there's room for local,\" Stewart said.\nStewart said some Silver King stations, located in top markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami, would be converted in about a year and others would follow.  \nHe declined to detail Diller's programming plans but said the stations would cover local news and sports with a format common on all Silver King stations. Some entertainment executives have speculated the Silver King stations would program daytime and late-night slots initially.\nSilver King, which is paid by Home Shopping Network to broadcast its television retailing service, intends to seek cable-system carriage of Home Shopping as its stations convert to traditional television programming.\nA Home Shopping spokesman declined to say whether or not the company had reached carriage deals with any cable systems.  \nDiller said last spring that Silver King, which is partly owned by Tele-Communications Inc subsidiary Liberty Media, as is Home Shopping Network, intended to break away from Home Shopping but that the conversion would take two or three years.\nDiller also has a stake in SF Broadcasting, owner of four stations, that could be woven into a new U.S. network.\n\"I think it's a very viable deal,\" said analyst Alvin Mirman of Commonwealth Associates. \"Diller reduces Home Shopping's distribution costs immediately. That could be a much as $40 million a year.\"\nDiller, a highly successful television programmer credited with the FOX network's racy and successful shows, is also expected to revive Home Shopping Network's fortunes.

We have regular contacts at that level and will continue to do so with NTT and others.\"\nWhile BT is playing its cards close to its chest, some analysts speculated that the company, keen to get a foothold in the lucrative Asian telecoms markets via the world's biggest telecoms player, might hammer out a deal with NTT quite soon.\n\"I think that they are quite close to it,\" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen Strauss Turnbull. But he added: \"That is just instinct.\"\nOne analyst even said he had made a bet with a colleague that a deal would be signed or announced before the end of February. But others were split.\n\"You would expect in the next 12-18 months something to happen,\" said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch, adding: \"If it happened tomorrow, we'd be all pleasantly surprised.\"\nAnother said he thought an imminent \"memorandum of understanding\" between the two companies was quite possible. But he added: \"But in terms of any tangible, real tie-up, I would put it later in the year.\"\nBut analysts agree on two things. They dismiss as a \"courtship ritual\" NTT's statement that it might prefer to branch out into the global international market on its own.\nThey also believe that NTT will want to be calling the shots on any deal.\nNTT may even stop short of a straight deal with BT and MCI's Concert alliance, preferring to link up with more than one global alliance. \"On a selected basis, they may link up with as many as possible,\" said one analyst.\nAt present, there are three main alliances.\nApart from Concert, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint have formed Global One. The third consortium is WorldPartners, a loosely-knit organisation created by U.S. telecoms gaint AT&T.\nMembers include Unisource, a venture of PTT Telecom of the Netherlands, a Swedish firm, the Swiss service provider, Spain's Telefonica and a stack of Asia-Pacific members such as Hongkong Telecom, Australia's Telstra and Korea Telecom.\nBT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield is also travelling to Japan at the end of this month, part of a regular trip where he is likely to meet NTT executives, BT says.\nBT has had an office in Japan for 10 years and already has a minor link with one of NTT's units, NTT Data, which distributes its Concert Internet Plus services.\nIt sent its first regional director to Tokyo this year in a move to highlight the growing importance of the area.", "Britons will shortly learn how much they will be asked to pay to help fund the expansion of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio and television services in the multi-channel future.\nThe BBC has been lobbying the government to grant it an above-inflation increase in the annual licence fee, arguing that more money is needed if it is to remain at the forefront of broadcasting into the next millennium. The government is expected to announce its decision by early to mid-December.\nThe BBC, which calls itself \"the world's most successful cultural institution\", derives 95 percent of its funding from the annual fee payable by all television set owners.\nThe fee stands at 89.50 pounds ($150) and provided income of 1.8 billion pounds in the last financial year -- far outweighing the 77 million pound net benefit from the BBC's expanding commercial arm. The licence is guaranteed as a source of BBC funding for the next five years.\nBBC Director-General John Birt launched his campaign for what he said would be the first real increase in the licence fee in over a decade at a conference in Edinburgh in August.\n\"If the BBC is to sustain the existing level of services; if it is to remain as creative and dynamic an institution in the 21st as it has been in the 20th century; if it is to innovate with high quality services in the new technologies...we shall need a real increse in the level of the licence fee,\" he said.\n\"Neither a new leap forward in efficiency, nor a vigorous drive to increase our commercial revenue will be enough.\"\nThe BBC is believed to be seeking a rise of around five pounds -- which would generate extra revenue of more than 100 million pounds. Annual inflation is currently 2.7 percent.\nBirt's call has received a cool reponse from the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, wary of pinning a price rise on more than 20 million households in the run-up to a general election. The new rate would take effect in April while the election must be held by the following month.\nRecent newspaper reports said that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has settled for a five-year formula that would leave the licence fee unchanged in real terms.\nThe reports said that Bottomley would offer higher rises in the second and third years to help fund new digital services and commercial projects but that increases in the following two years would be pegged below inflation.\nThe BBC, which runs two television channels and five national radio stations and has an enviable reputation as a quality public service broadcaster, has stepped up its campaign.\n\"You want us to do things. We want to do them. Now please give us the means and we can get on with the job,\" Will Wyatt, chief executive of the BBC Broadcast division said in a recent speech.\n\"We have called for only a modest increase, but one which would enable us to achieve a disproportionate amount of good.\"\nThe BBC points out that it has cut its cost base by almost 20 percent over the past three years and increased programme investment by 300 million pounds.\nThe licence fee debate comes as the broadcasting industry is set to be revolutionised by the move to digital transmission.\nDigital technology converts sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones. It increases picture quality, multiplies the number of channels that can be broadcast and allows for the creation of interactive services.\nPay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service with some 200 channels into Britain from next year.\nBSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s, is Britain's leading pay television operator with more than five million subscribers. Its top package of premium films and live sports events costs subscribers 324 pounds per annum.\nA terrestrial digital service, broadcast from land-based transmitters and offering some 36 channels, is expected to begin by mid-1998.\nThe BBC plans to use digital technology to offer all licence payers supplementary programming to its core BBC1 and BBC2 output plus a 24-hour news service. It plans to make them available via satellite and terrestrial distribution.\nThe BBC expects to retain a share of around a third of all viewing and listening in 2005, down from 45 percent as the number of channels multiplies and the market fragments.\nThe digital expansion creates fresh opportunities for the corporation to develop its BBC Worldwide commercial arm.\nWorldwide is in negotiations with partners in Britain and the United States over the creation of a number of subscription channels, exploiting its strengths in areas such as comedy, drama and natural history.\nIts partner in Britain is Flextech Plc, while it is working with Discovery Communications Inc on channels for international markets. Leading U.S. cable television operator Tele-Communications Inc is a major shareholder in both companies. It aims to launch its UK services in mid 1997.\nSome media figures doubt the sustainability of the licence fee as subscription and pay-per-view services proliferate.\nDavid Elstein, chief executive of Britain's new Channel 5 commercial television network, said recently that he believed that pay-per-view would eventually \"consign the licence fee to history, where it belongs\".", "Regulators took the first of two steps Tuesday to slash the cost of overseas phone calls for consumers and businesses, making it easier for U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate cheaper international rates.\nThe Federal Communications Commission hopes to save U.S. callers billions of dollars by backing up the new rules with a separate proposal to be unveiled next month to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete calls from the United States.\nAmericans spend about 16 cents a minute for a domestic call. But they must shell out an average of 99 cents a minute to call overseas -- even though the cost of the calls are not much different, according to FCC officials.\n\"At 99 cents a minute, you're not going to get a global information highway,\" complained FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.\nTuesday's rules are targeted at countries whose own phone markets are open to competition from U.S. carriers, or are in the process of opening. FCC officials cited Canada, Britain, Chile and Sweden, as well as Europe and Mexico.\nUnder the plan announced Tuesday, the FCC will waive rules that limit the ability of U.S. carriers to negotiate cheaper calling rates with an overseas phone company whose own market is considered open. The rules were crafted to prevent market abuse by foreign monopolies.\nDon Gips, head of the FCC's International Bureau, said the new rules \"will allow competitive pressures, rather than archaic rules,\" to govern the telecommunications market.\nAT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme said they \"can lead to a significant reduction in the amount that American consumers pay for international telephone calls.\"\nUnder the new approach, a company such as AT&T -- with FCC approval -- could ask competing foreign carriers to bid for the right to handle AT&T phone traffic from the United States to a foreign market.\nAlternatively, a U.S. carrier could offer end-to-end service from the United States to a foreign market without using the existing rate system for completing calls.\nOfficials say these \"accounting rates\" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. U.S. carriers paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.\nWhile the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.\nInternational calls from the United States account for about a quarter of all international calls worldwide.\nTo reduce the rates, the FCC proposal scheduled for next month would set \"benchmark\" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.\nThe agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.\nThe FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.\nThe United States has big rate imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others. Next month's proposal is likely to ruffle feathers.\n\"There will be concern from countries around the world with the benchmark item. There's no doubt about that,\" said the FCC's Gips.", "Israel's flag carrier El Al is to start using a Boeing 747 on its once weekly Tel Aviv to Hong Kong service as part of a drive to increase tourism and trade with the Middle East, Abraham Roter, the carrier's the airline's general manager for China, Hong Kong and east Asia said.\nFrom the end of this month the 747 will replace a smaller Boeing 767 which flies via Tashkent. The 747 will be a direct flight from Israel to Hong Kong which will stop in Bombay to refuel on the return leg, Roter said.\nEl Al said it was the only airline offering a direct link to the Middle East, as opposed to carriers such as Emirates which fly to the Gulf, and which offers good connections around the Mediterranean region. The larger aircraft will increase cargo capacity from 10 upto 24 tonnes and increase passenger comfort, Roter told Reuters in an interview from his Hong Kong office.\nEl Al is holding a series of seminars with travel agents to try and entice more tourists from Hong Kong. Current passenger levels to Tel Aviv are between five and six thousand a year.\n\"We believe that the market has big potential because Hong Kong people are big travellers and we are offering them a wonderful destination which is just 10 hours away,\" Roter said.", "Outboard Marine Corp said it is only five percent finished with a radical restructuring that it expects will result in more charges against earnings in 1997 and possibly in 1998, the company said.\nRestructuring is about \"five percent complete as far as going down the road and getting the savings,\" said spokesman Stan Main. \"That does not mean that we've taken only five percent of our restructuring charges.... There will likely be more charges during'97 and perhaps even into'98.\"\nShares in Outboard on Friday were off 1/4 to 15-3/4.  \nThe Waukegan, Ill.-based maker of boats and boat engines reported fourth-quarter profits Thursday that, excluding restructuring charges, beat Wall Street estimates.\nAnalysts cautioned, however, that a turnaround at Outboard remains a long-term project.\n\"They're going to be continuing this restructuring process in'97 and they're going to continue to have some more charges.... They describe the phase they're in now as the discovery process,\" said Lehman Brothers analyst Harriet Baldwin.\nA key moment could come Tuesday when Outboard executives are scheduled to meet with analysts and investors in New York.  \nExpected to be in attendance are the principals of Greenway Partners, an investment firm led by former Carl Icahn associates Alfred Kingsley and Gary Duberstein. Greenway bought an 8.5-percent stake in Outboard this summer.\nAlthough the firm is known for activism, Greenway so far has not pressured Outboard to alter course, Main said. Nor has there been further communication between Greenway and company executives since initial discussions in August, he said.\nAnalysts speculated there could be fireworks next week or at the January 16 annual meeting of shareholders, who are said to be growing impatient for a cohesive recovery plan.  \nA restructuring was set in motion this year by chief executive Harry Bowman, who came aboard in 1995, when the stock was trading in the low 20s. Bowman continues to deliberate over how to fix Outboard and key pieces remain to be put in place, analysts said.\nThe business is under evaluation from top to bottom, Main said. Once restructuring is complete, Outboard \"certainly will be a marine products company,\" he said.  \n\"Longer term, we could get into products that would not be marine related. But our initial focus over the next two to three years is to fix the business that we're in and then perhaps look at other areas that might be less cyclical or seasonal,\" said Main, who is director of strategic planning.\nBowman has spoken of finding more stability for Outboard, which suffers more from boating's boom-bust cycles than rivals, such as Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp, which has diversified into bowling, fishing and camping gear.\nOutboard sees opportunities to enter other markets -- such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and personal watercraft -- via its innovative FICHT fuel injection engine technology, Main said.\nSpending on capital and tooling in fiscal 1996, ended September 30, fell to $52.7 million from $66.5 million the year before, but spending on FICHT is holding steady as the company converts more of its engine line to it, he said.\nSales of 150-hp FICHT engines to dealers will begin in December and consumers will see the engines in January. A promotional roll-out is underway.\nThe company plans to convert its entire outboard engine line above 20-hp to FICHT engines, which will cost 22 to 25 percent more than their traditional equivalents, Main said.", "Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd., moved on Monday to resolve a dispute over its huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, forging an alliance with a company controlled by the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto.\n\"This is an important first step to the resolution of Bre-X's problems,\" said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada.\nThe stock jumped C$3.50 to C$24.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, topping actives on more than 6.4 million shares. On Nasdaq, Bre-X rose $2.625 to $18.25.\nBre-X said it will pay $40 million for a deal with PT Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group run by Sigit Harjojudanto, Suharto's eldest son.\nAnalysts said the alliance with Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group involved in energy, mining and telecommunications, should help Bre-X clear up a widely publicised dispute over the ownership of its glittering Busang gold discovery.\nBre-X stock has taken a beating in recent weeks because of the dispute.\nOne of Bre-X's Indonesian partners, Jusuf Merukh, is seeking a 40 percent stake in Busang, which has estimated gold reserves of 47 million ounces.\nThe Indonesian government has said it will delay issuing the crucial contracts of work to Bre-X until the dispute is resolved. Without the contracts, Bre-X cannot advance its work on the Busang deposit.\nThe dispute has also clouded Bre-X's quest to find a major mining partner to develop and operate Busang.\nPanutan will receive a 10 percent interest in the richest parts of the Busang gold deposit on the island of Kalimantan, Bre-X said.\nIn return, Panutan will act as a consultant for Bre-X in Indonesia and help the Calgary, Alberta-based company deal with administrative and technical matters. The deal is conditional on Bre-X's receiving essential permits from the Indonesian government.\n\"Having an arrangement with this fellow is a bonus,\" said Ing, the analyst. \"The key in Indonesia is who you know.\"\n\"They seemed to have teamed up with a partner with high standing,\" said mining analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.\n\"This should clear up most of the (ownership) claims that are out there.\"\nMerukh told Reuters in Jakarta on Monday that he was optimistic a deal would be reached in November.\nBut Bre-X's hold on the Busang discovery is shrinking as it works out its problems, said Ing.\nHe said Bre-X will probably have to give away another slice of the deposit to Merukh and his Australian supporters, Golden Valley Mines NL.\n\"Slowly and salami-like, Bre-X is getting cut back,\" said Ing.\nOfficials at Bre-X did not return phone calls to discuss details of the alliance.", "Russia's demand for feed grains will outstrip any output increases its agriculture sector manages in coming years, which could turn the country into a big importer, industry officials said on Friday.\nRussia, which has just completed its second poor harvest in two years, the third worst in 30 years, is heading into the next crop cycle with few signs that its dismal track-record will soon recover.\n\"For now, consumption is still low enough to offset the decline in output, but demand is still going to rise faster than production,\" said Alexander Yukish, president of the Grain Union, which groups leading private traders.\nRussian farmers have to struggle to get their hands on whatever seeds, tractors and fertilisers they can scrape together.\nThe agriculture sector, one of the most inefficient and least-reformed in Russia, has not adopted the pro-market changes reshaping some other domestic industries.\n\"Russia will need at least 120 million tonnes of grain when livestock levels and consumption return to the levels we had in 1990,\" said Yukish. But he said Russian grains output, which has nearly halved in recent years, would not stage a comeback for at least another five or 10 years.\n\"There is just not enough feed grain in Russia -- we've got to produce more soymeal and maize,\" Alexander Vasyutin, deputy head of the Agriculture Ministry's crops growing section, said.\nRussia has been slaughtering livestock because it does not have enough grain to feed it. Bread is a staple in Russia but people are eating less and product quality is patchy.\nRussia's just-completed 1996 gross harvest was 74.6 million tonnes, according to preliminary official figures -- just eight percent above 1995's disastrous net 63.4 million tonnes, the worst since about 1965.\nAbout eight percent of the 1996 total will be lost after cleaning -- putting net output at about 68.6 million tonnes.\nSome analysts say up to 20 percent of Russia's harvest was lost in the Soviet era due to inefficient, obsolete combines, and that losses now, with even less money for adequate equipment, may still be severe.\n\"Next year, we'll see the same harvest we had this year, maybe a little more, maybe a little less,\" Yukish said. \"But to expect sharp increases in output next year is not realistic.\"\nIndustry officials said that with the domestic economy showing signs of turning around and a growing middle-class hungry for meat, Russia must act fast if it is to satisfy demand in the future.\nAlready the signs do not point to big increases next year.\nVasyutin said farmers, afraid of unseasonably warm, dry weather that has lasted into November across Russia's grain belt, had sown 1.2 million fewer hectares, or around 14.5 million hectares, to winter grains for harvesting in 1997.\n\"Crops are in a satisfactory condition, but moisture levels are not adequate,\" he said, adding government officials had targeted a 1997 harvest of at least 70 million tonnes.\"\nWinter wheat accounts for about 15 percent of Russian wheat output and can crucially tip the balance.\n\"Russians want to eat meat -- but this desire has to be preceeded by very serious structural changes in agriculture,\" Yukish said. \"Russia will be a big feed grains importer for quite a while -- of that I am quite sure.\"", "Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes.\n\"We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,\" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue.\nAnticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.  \nAs the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth.\nThere are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.  \nThat size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. \"Market share isn't just an important factor,\" Merrin said. \"It's the only factor.\"\nIngram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.\nIts main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.  \n\"Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,\" Shah said.\nUnderlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.\nCompanies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.  \nIn one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.\nIngram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.\nThe company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.  \nAn anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood \"Chip\" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.\nIngram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.\nBut any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.  \n\"It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,\" said Shah for shares of the stock. \"I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,\" he added.  \nIn an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about \"the Channel\" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product.\nIngram is to \"the Channel\" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking.", "Investors were on edge on Wednesday, anxiously awaiting the outcome of talks between Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. aimed at forging a deal on Indonesia's huge Busang gold deposit.\nAs a Dec. 4 deadline slid by, Bre-X and Barrick said they were still trying to work out several issues, leaving the market to speculate about the status of negotiations.\n\"Several points remain outstanding,\" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said. \"An overall deal has not been reached.\"\nThe Indonesian government directed Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick by Dec. 4, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X's stake in the rich gold discovery and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The companies were asked to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent in the rich find.\nAs the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry.\nIn Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.\n\"If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action.... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,\" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.\n\"What the action will be.... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X's stock by C$1.40 to C$20.10 ($14.90) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.10 to C$38.95 ($28.85).\n\"People think there's an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later,\" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.\nBut she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X's stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.\n\"We're actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they're just dotting the I's and crossing the t's,\" Gignac said. \"Everything has been set. We just don't know the details.\"\nBut a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.\nThe latest deadline, if passed, would be the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.\nPossible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.\nWaiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.\n\"I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,\" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to partner with Bre-X to develop Busang.\n\"We're not discouraged. It's going to be a long process,\" he said.\nNewmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.", "A former German secret agent and his wife were formally charged with abduction on Wednesday after their bid to smuggle a rebel kidnap victim out of Colombia backfired at the weekend.\nThe charges, announced by the chief prosecutor's office, brought another twist to a brewing scandal that has set the Colombian government at odds with German diplomats and businessmen over clandestine payments to kidnappers.\nPolice and Colombian officials accuse Werner Mauss, 56, of being an international member of the country's National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla force, or a mercenary negotiating the release of abducted foreigners in return for a cut of the ransom.\nIn a statement issued in Bonn on Wednesday, German government official Peter Hausmann said the government was \"fully informed\" of the former state security agent's mission and welcomed such \"unconventional methods to rescue Germans from life and death situations.\"\nMauss and Silvia Schroder, 36, were seized at Rionegro airport near Medellin early on Sunday as they tried to bundle a third German, Brigitte Schoene, the wife of a former BASF Chemicals executive, aboard a private charter plane bound for Venezuela. Schoene was kidnapped in mid-August by the ELN, which had demanded $6 million for her release.\nIn its press release, the chief prosecutor's office referred to Mauss and his wife as Juergen and Isabel Seidel -- one of their many aliases. The couple were remanded in custody.\nAn executive secretary of Siemens-Colombia said on Wednesday she had hired the plane that Mauss was to use for his getaway on the orders of a top industrialist formerly based in Bogota.\nSecurity experts say Colombia -- home to Latin America's longest-running guerrilla war -- is swarming with foreign mercenaries carrying out shadowy undercover missions as kidnappings reportedly run at almost one every 2-1/2 hours.\n\"Many multinationals are hiring so-called security advisers for kidnap, terrorist and extortion situations but these are simply mercenaries and adventurers willing to make pacts with kidnappers and guerrillas,\" said private security consultant Col. Luis Enrique La Rotta.\nParliamentarian Guillermo Martinez, a retired air force officer, told Reuters he was sure dozens of foreign mercenaries like Mauss had poured into Colombia to carry out hostage rescue missions.\n\"Regardless of whether the Colombian authorities can or cannot control the (kidnap) situation it is totally unacceptable for foreign companies to fly in mercenaries to do this type of work,\" he said.", "Building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd reported on Friday a first half net profit in line with expectations, but comments on the second half by the group is likely to see full year earnings forecasts trimmed.\nJames Hardie, 27.23 owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996, in line with analysts' forecasts.\nBut managing director Keith Barton said he expected the second half result to be significantly down on the first half.  \nAnalysts at the company's results briefing said Barton's comments on the second half meant that estimates for pre-abnormal net profit for the 1996/97 year would be trimmed back to around A$50 million from A$53-A$54 million.\nThey welcomed the company's statement that outlook for its U.S. businesses were very positive for the 1996/97 second half and into 1997/98.\n\"In contrast, the outlook for Australian operations remains bleak in the short term,\" it said.  \n\"In view of the immediate prospects, the company maintains its previously stated position that profit for the full year will reflect a marked deterioration on last year's results,\" the company said.\n\"Growth prospects for the following year remain very positive,\" James Hardie said.\nKeith Barton said the first half downturn reflected a fall in earnings from Australian building products due to lower housing starts.  \n\"Reduced activity in the housing sector had an adverse impact on both volumes and margins for the Australian building boards, windows and bathroom products businesses,\" he said.\nContinued strong performances from the fibre cement and gypsum businesses in the United States as well as solid performances from New Zealand had however helped the result.\n\"U.S. fibre cement production sold out during the six months to September and we continue to ship significant volumes of product from Australian and New Zealand plants to satisfy demand,\" Barton said.  \nHardie had just increased U.S. fibre cement production capacity by more than 40 percent to 480 million square feet through the commissioning of a third line at Plant City in Florida.\nHowever analysts said the market would not be worrying too much about 1996/97 results, which are widely expected to be down on the A$58.4 million pre-abnormal net profit reported in the year to March 31, 1996.\nBarton said he expected a rebound in profit in the year to March 31, 1998, following an expected fall in profit in the 1996/97 year.  \n\"I expect it to be higher, but it is too early to say if it will be significantly higher,\" Barton later told reporters.\nAnalysts forecast James Hardie to have pre-abnormal net profit earnings of about A$90 million in 1997/98.\nBarton also revealed that the Sydney-based group was conducting a study of the European fibre cement market, but had made no decison to enter any European countries yet.\n\"We are going to have a look, it is a large market,\" Barton said. \"It is early days, we are just having a look to see if we can understand the market.\"  \nSales for the first half rose 2.7 percent to A$913.9 million, while the dividend remained unchanged at 6.5 cents per share.\nAt 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), James Hardie shares were six cents lower at A$3.40 in a weaker Australian sharemarket that has been hit by a slump in the local bond market.", "U.S. consumers are greeting the latest home computers -- faster than ever, but lacking new whiz-bang features -- with a collective yawn.\nMajor U.S. electronics retailers said Thursday that home PC sales were weak in October and analysts see few signs of a recovery without lower prices or a technology breakthrough.\n\"Everybody seems to have stopped buying PCs all of a sudden,\" said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Terrence McEvoy.\nDefying the downdraft are mail-order computer vendors and sellers of computers to business, which are both thriving.  \nTheir success reflects a shifting market, analysts said.\n\"The business today is less first-time buyers and more repeat customers,\" said Robertson Stephens analyst Edward Lee.\nThe pool of entry-level buyers is contracting and the PC industry increasingly relies on second- or third-time buyers, who are smarter than novices. Veterans look for vendors offering lots of peripherals, such as CompUSA Inc, or discount mail-order houses, such as Dell Computer Corp and Gateway 2000 Inc, analysts said.\nThat leaves generalists, like Best Buy Co and Circuit City Stores, to fight for a shrinking market.  \nEden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy, with 268 stores in 31 states, reported October sales were down 15 percent from a year ago on a same-store basis and said \"the sale of personal computers was impacted by industry-wide weakness.\"\nRichmond, Va.-based Circuit City saw an October decline in same-store sales of nine percent and cited \"softness in the personal computer and.... consumer electronics categories.\"\nDisappointing results were posted by Tandy Corp, owner of the RadioShack, Computer City and Incredible Universe chains. \"Our results parallel the sluggish consumer electronics and personal computer retail market,\" Tandy said.  \n\"Demand is starting to dry up across the board,\" Lee said.\nBest Buy shares Thursday fell 3-1/4 to 13 on the October report. Circuit City shares were up 3/8 to 34-7/8. Shares in Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy were off 3/4 to 38-3/4.\nAt the same time, shares in Dell were up 1-1/2 to 88-5/8, while Gateway 2000 shares were up 3-3/4 to 52-3/4. Shares in computer and microprocessor manufacturers also rallied, with Intel Corp up 5-3/4 to 124-5/8 and International Business Machines Corp up 1 to 134-1/4.  \nPC sales at this time last year were buoyed by promotions and the multi-media explosion. The home PC was transformed from a word processor into a high-quality game station and an educational tool for kids thanks to CD-ROM drives, speakers and soundcard packages and a bevy of new applications.\n\"Today, computers are faster than they were a year ago, but what does it do more?\" Lee asked. \"Demand is driven by applications and how it changes the typical consumer's life.\"\nSavvy consumers could just be waiting for lower prices, of course, and analysts said if they keep dropping, there may yet be a holiday buying burst. But without some hot new features, the shopping season for PC retailers could be a cold one.\n\"When you've got Intel moving up five in one day and Best Buy moving down three the same day, that tells you something.... It's a tough business,\" said Securities Corp of Iowa analyst Pat Dunkerley.", "Small capitalization technology stocks shrugged off a wave of profit-taking that socked blue chip stocks Monday as investors shopped for values among beaten- down or lesser known names, especially in the Internet sector.\n\"Some of the second- and third-tier technology names have become the focus,\" agreed Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  \nAmong the beneficiaries of this broadening interest in technology stocks were America Online Inc, up 4-1/8 to 39-1/2 and Adobe Systems Inc, up 2-1/4 to 41-3/4.\nInformix Corp was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq, gaining 1-1/4 to 25 by mid-afternoon Monday, following reports that its next-generation Universal Server database has the edge over rival Oracle Corp.\nOther strong gainers included Netscape Communications Corp, which rose 2-1/8 to 58 and electronic payment company CyberCash Inc, which gained 2-7/8 to 28-1/8.  \n\"We are stepping down the liquidity and quality ladder,\" said Paul Rabbit, Oppenheimer's chief portfolio strategist. \"(Investors) are trying to find some of the beat up ones,\" he said, adding, \"There is a search for less exploited areas.\"\n\"Today is the first (trading) day of a new month and there appears to be a little profit taking here, but it doesn't appear to be affecting the technology stocks,\" Bleier said.\nAnalysts said investors were shying from bellwethers Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp following their strong run-up in November, even as International Business Machines Corp hit a new year-high.  \nIntel was down 1-1/8 to 125-3/4 on volume of nearly five million shares, while Microsoft shed 1-1/4 to 155-5/8. Both stocks remain near historic price levels. The Dow Jones composite index was off 41.74 to 6479.96.", "The semiconductor industry said Monday its key indicator rose last month to the highest level in almost a year, reflecting a surge in new orders for computer chips.\nThe so-called book-to-bill ratio, which measures the value of new orders compared with shipments over a trailing three-month period, jumped to 1.10 in October from a revised 0.98 in September, marking the first time it has been over 1 since December 1995.\nThe index, widely regarded as a sign of the computer industry's health, means that manufacturers received $110 in new orders for every $100 in shipments.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association said new chip orders in October rose 17.9 percent to $3.84 billion while shipments increased by 5 percent from the previous month to $3.39 billion.\nAnalysts said the surge was likely a one-time phenomenon as vendors sought to catch up with increasing demand after having pared back inventories sharply early in the year when prices of memory chips in particular were tumbling.\n\"These strong numbers for new orders in the Americas market should reinforce our industry's cautious optimism for a solid fourth quarter,\" said Douglas Andrey, director of Information Systems and Finance at the Securities Industry Association.\nAnalysts said they expect computer chip stocks, which had been firm ahead of the announcement on the expectation the ratio would rise modestly to somewhere between 0.99 and 1.03, to advance further following the upbeat data.\nShares of Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, surged as high as $124.69 in after-hours trade, 6 cents below its all-time trading high last week. Earlier, it closed up $1.625 at $123.875 on the Nasdaq market.\n\"I think it's an overall positive for stocks tomorrow,\" said Charles Boucher, semiconductor analyst at UBS Securities.\n\"The Street got possibly a little better than they were looking for, so I think you've got a chance to add on to this rally tomorrow,\" he said. \"The danger here is in investors getting too enthusiastic about the size of this number.\"\nSeparately, the trade group said it was planning to phase out the North American semiconductor index and replace it with a global index that would help industry watchers keep better track of demand for computer chips.\nThe industry group said it was making the change because the current figure only tracks sales and orders in the Americas, representing only a third of the total world market, and provided disproportionate data on certain chip sectors.\nWhile both industry and analysts have criticized the wide fluctuations and frequent revisions in the data -- even the September number was revised to 0.98 from 0.99 -- the move taken by industry consensus met with mixed reviews.\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" said Intel spokesman Howard High. \"The book-to-bill hasn't really reflected the true health of the industry, good or bad, for quite a while.\"\n\"As the business turned very global in its nature, the book-to-bill flash report was a U.S.-based number,\" he said. \"If you take it to the global market, it's really not done the job that people have been using it for.\"\nBut some analysts said the decision to drop aggregate bookings data altogether would only increase the amount of market uncertainty, as investors would have to rely on far more speculative estimates of new orders.\n\"I think it's going to blow up in their face,\" one top analyst said. \"It's going to be a lot more speculative. We're all going to be trying to do the analysis but we're going to be doing it based on our own independent surveys.\"\nKey semiconductor makers had argued, however, that bookings data was imprecise and subject to varying inventory strategies of distributors without any uniform reporting methods.", "Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.\nLiberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.\nBT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty.\nLiberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.\nBT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture \"critical mass from the outset\" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Liberty's chairman Donald Gordon said.\nGordon said Liberty was \"well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry.\" Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.\nDavid Fischel, Liberty's managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch.\nHermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.\n\"Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,\" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.\nRoss Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.\n\"It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us.\"\nHe said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.\nThe decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost.\n\"I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this,\" he said.\nLiberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.", "British property giant Land Securities said on Wednesday there were signs of rental growth in some sectors of the British property market and that it expected more to come.\nCompany chairman Peter Hunt said that while there was a feeling there was more rental growth to come, so far it had been patchy.\nGrowth in rental rates would be slower than in the 1980s and because it was not across the board it was crucial to be selective in the properties and developments chosen.\nLand on Wednesday reported a pre-tax profit of 128.9 million pounds ($213 million) for the first half, including sales of properties, from 118.1 million pounds last time.\nThe company, which reported an increased interim dividend of 7.35 pence, said it had plans for \"major shopping centre schemes\" in a number of British towns, including Canterbury, York and Sunderland, as well as \"several proposed new leisure developments\".\nThe group said the annual level of expenditure on its current development programme was expected to peak during the second half of the financial year.\nIt said revenue profit, which was down to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds for the period, \"is being affected by our prudent policy of not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying our substantial programme\".\nBut it was upbeat on its overall prospects. \"We believe that our strategy of creating growth assets through development will result in a considerable addition to the rental income and capital value of the portfolio in years to come,\" Hunt said.\n\"Yes, they (the developments) are on target, although you can never be totally sure,\" he added in an interview.\nFinance director Jim Murray told Reuters a drop in revenue profit for the half year, to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds the previous year, was widely expected and had been flagged in advance.\nThis reflected the fact that the group was financing a large development programme and was not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying this out.\nHunt said property developments continued to be higher yielding business but that most land-owners were holding out on the sale of good land.\n\"(There is) a much better performance on a development. It is the best growth stock...it's very much in demand. That's why we are concentrating on doing as much development as we can,\" Hunt added.\nThe group was also buying investments in the \"second-hand\" market. \"We are pursuing both avenues,\" he said, pointing out that Land Securities had recently added the Team Valley Retail Park, south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to its portfolio.\nThis would make \"a substantial and valuable addition to our 500 million pound retail warehouse portfolio,\" he said in his chairman's statement.\nDuring the half year the company had bought, or agreed to buy, nearly 80 million pounds of investment properties.\nHunt said he did not think there would be a less favourable environment for the group if Britiain's opposition Labour party won power from the ruling Conservative government at the next general election, due to be held by May 1997.\n\"I believe the strategies we are pursuing will apply equally within a New Labour environment as in a Conservative (one).\"\nHunt said that while he could not comment on possible acquisition targets, the firm looked at \"everything from time to time\" but would have to \"want to own quite a high proportion of the properties\" of any target company before making a bid.", "Shares in French sports equipment maker Groupe Salomon SA fell sharply for the second day in a row on Thursday after a long and steady rise which saw the share more than double in value this year.\nDealers said that the company, headed by Jean-Francois Gautier and based in the mountain region of Annecy in the east of France, had become the victim of a number of rumours which cast a pall over the dynamic picture of the company.\nSalomon executives were in London on Thursday on the second day of an investors' road-show, discussing the recent first half sales figures.\n\"There are two rumours in the market. One is that a Japanese distributor has gone bankrupt, which could cost the company money, and the other is that the roadshow is going badly,\" a share dealer said.\nSalomon was down 17 francs, or 3.83 percent, at 427 francs at 1141 GMT after having given in 26 francs on Wednesday.\n\"In fact one of our distributors in Japan, Olympic Sports Co has gone bankrupt. But that is already in the first half figures and it will not change anything on the group level,\" Salomon spokeswoman Linda Champtenois told Reuters.\nOlympic Sports applied for court mediation with creditors on September 20 with debts of 34.83 billion yen and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) cancelled the company's Over-the-Counter registration.\nSalomon's Champtenois said that \"everybody knows about the difficult market for winter sport equipment in Japan\" and brushed off the effect on Salomon's results.\nMeanwhile Salomon's Japanese subsidiary Salomon & Taylor Made Co was trading in Tokyo at 810 yen, just above its life low of 790 yen and far below its year high of 1,790 yen. It was introduced on the OTC market in November 1995 at 1,800 yen.\nOn November 5, the Japanese unit reduced its parent six-months net results forecast to 288 million yen from 620 million yen and a comparable figure of 556 million.\nChamptenois said that the roadshow in London had been long planned, followed on a September 30 visit to Edinburgh and was \"going fine\".\nFrench dealers said that even if the rumours were unfounded and the Japan effect limited, they were a catalyst for profit-taking, especially now that the French market has hit a year high at a level not seen since in 1994.\nSalomon has been a stock market darling. From a low of 171.50 francs on March 14 in 1995, Salomon rose to an all-time high of 494 francs on October 22 this year.\nOn October 30, it said its first half sales to end September, at constant currency rates, rose by 21.8 percent to 2.021 billion francs.\nWhile hiking equipment -- walking boots and mountain gear -- was up by 68 percent and the Taylor Made golf equipment brand had a 77 percent increase in sales. Winter equipment, however, was down 16 percent. The Mavic cycle brand was up 4.1 percent.\nSalomon had earlier forecast that its operating results for the 1996/97 year would be stable due to the cost of further diversification into snowboards with the aqcuisiion of Bonfire and the planned launch of new boards, shoes and fixtures in 1997 as well as new roller skates in 1998.\nIn the year to March 1996, Salomon made a net attributable profit of 308 million francs against 161 million last year.", "South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Thursday defended a proposed controversial deal to buy France's Thomson Multimedia by pledging to make investments in the company.\nThe head of Daewoo Electronics and the founder of its parent company tried to allay French fears through interviews in two leading French newspapers, promising hefty investment and a long term commitment to the country.\nThe chairman of Daewoo Electronics, Bae Soon-hoon, was trying to counter criticism about a South Korean company acquiring leading-edge French digital television technology cheaply. He said his company would spend at least 10 billion french francs ($1.9 billion) on TMM.\nFrench Finance Minister Jean Arthuis meanwhile reaffirmed that the government was set on selling defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo even if Prime Minister Juppe wanted a public debate on the sale of the state group.\nJuppe told parliament on Tuesday he would call a debate on the sale, for one symbolic franc, after an 11 billion franc ($2.2 billion) capital injection, in reaction to a public outcry and criticism from opposition parties and also from within his own coalition.\nArthuis dismissed criticism on the government's decision to sell the company by way of a private placement instead of a public sale.\n\"This is a company that could not be privatised through a public offer,\" Arthuis told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday. \"How could we ask several investors to bid on a company with a negative net value.\"\nThomson has debts of some 14 billion francs.\nLagardere wants to merge Thomson SA's 58-percent-owned and profitable defence group Thomson-CSF with its Matra unit and sell loss-making consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo Electronics.\nThe state's Privatisation Commission is currently studying both the preferred bid by Lagardere/Daewoo and one by Alcatel Alsthom and is expected to give its opinion in early December.\nThe chairman of Daewoo Electronics said his company would spend at least 10 billion francs on TMM in an effort to still the rising criticism about the deal.\n\"In total, the immediate cost of acquisition and recapitalisation of Thomson Multimedia for Daewoo is some 10 billion francs. But these 10 billion are only a first stage,\" Bae Soon-hoon told the La Tribune Desfosses newspaper, breaking his self-imposed silence on Daewoo's bid details.\nHe said South Korea and France had increasingly direct links, adding that French companies had sold the TGV high-speed train and nuclear power stations to his country and were planning to sell battle planes and other weapons.\nFrance's trade minister Yves Galland is due to travel to South Korea on Monday to promote the country's economic interests during a trip lasting until Thursday.\nFrance hopes to sell Dassault Rafale combat planes to South Korea to monitor its northern Communist neighbour.\nKim Woo-choong, chairman and founder of the Daewoo conglomerate, told France's Liberation newspaper in Seoul that big Japanese companies would want to see the Thomson deal fail.\n\"Certain big international electronics companies are against ths deal because they believe that the merger would make Daewoo too competitive,\" Woo-choong said, adding, \"These big companies are perhaps busy lobbying the French government.\"\nLiberation said he referred to Japanese companies.\n\"The French government cannot come back on its decision if there is not an important reason to do so,\" Woo-choong said.", "Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on October 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while the new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.\nImperial is Britain's second biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries and its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.\nIt is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate floated companies to unlock value.\nIn the ten years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. 1995 profits were 348 million pounds on 3.6 billion of sales.\nBut analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, marking it as the comeback kid of the tobbaco industry, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London.\nThis week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from U.S. President Bill Clinton to regulate the industry.\nSo far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.\n\"If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries,\" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.\n\"Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,\" he said.\nUBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.\nBut they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading - its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.\nImperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears that it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.\n\"We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average.\" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note.\nIt has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday.\nUBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion).\nHowever, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects.\n\"It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,\" he said.\nHe values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share.\nThere is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets.\nGareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\"Worldwide this industry is buoyant,\" he said.\nImperial has said in earlier mission statements that it will expand abroad through \"organic growth and acquisition.\"", "Bitter infighting broke out among Czech Social Democrats on Friday only a month before elections in which the opposition party hopes to humiliate conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nParty chairman Milos Zeman denied there was any split in his party, which is running neck and neck with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) before Senate elections next month.\nBut almost in the same breath he threatened to resign next spring unless a party deputy chairman who broke ranks to vote with the Klaus government last week went first.\nAdding to his woes, a Social Democrat deputy threatened to leave the parliamentary party in a row with an ex-communist colleague, a move which could tip the balance of parliamentary power between the minority government and opposition.\nKlaus, whose three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority in lower house elections earlier this year, has seemed under heavy pressure with opinion polls showing the Social Democrats level or slightly ahead of his ODS.\nBut just as the Social Democrats seemed in with a good chance of beating the ODS for the first time since the restoration of democracy, strife flared in opposition ranks.\nLast week Jozef Wagner, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, led a revolt by four Social Democrat deputies which allowed the 1997 state budget to pass its first reading.\nTempers flared on Friday after Wagner threatened to resign from the parliamentary party unless another Social Democrat deputy, ex-communist Michal Kraus, quit the budget committee and a parliamentary commission investigating a bank collapse.\nDespite the appearance of disarray in Social Democrat ranks, Zeman played down Wagner's threat. \"There is no real split. I do not want to overestimate the importance of his proclamation in this case,\" he told a news conference.\n\"A split would happen only if a body of opinion formed which was sharply different in questions of principle from the opinion of the party leadership,\" he said.\nBut then he attacked party deputy chairman Karel Machovec, one of the Wagner rebels. \"There should not be a person in the leadership who shows himself up by talking about disputes in the party,\" said Zeman.\nAsked if he would resign if Machovec remained vice chairman after a party congress scheduled for next March, Zeman said: \"Yes. It is true, I can confirm that.\"\nKraus, a communist deputy before the 1989 collapse of the East Bloc, accused the four budget rebels of being \"corrupted politically\" by the Klaus coalition.\nWagner told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes he would leave the Social Democratic parliamentary party or \"club\" if Kraus did not go. Machovec was quoted by local media as saying that if Wagner left, there would be a serious party split.\nThis could change the balance of power in the 200-seat lower house where the Social Democrats, along with the little-reformed Communists and the far-right Republicans, have 101 votes to the government's 99.\nThe Senate itself has few powers. But the elections on November 15 and 16, with a second round runoff a week later, have become a test of public opinion which could indicate whether early lower house elections are likely.\nAnalysts say that if the Social Democrats perform strongly, Zeman might be tempted to bring down the coalition to force lower house polls in which his party might overtake Klaus's ODS. But that depends on Zeman being able to maintain discipline.\nSo far voters do not seem concerned. A poll taken by the STEM agency before and after the budget vote showed the Social Democrats with 27.3 percent support ahead of ODS with 26.8.\nIn the lower house elections on May 31-June 1, ODS won 29.6 percent and the Social Democrats 26.4.", "Canada's largest stock exchange's key index broke through the psychological barrier of 5500 points on Monday to a new closing high of 5518 points.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 25.5 points to hit 5518 points by day's end, propelled by soaring gold issues and surging oil stocks.\nThe 300 Index reached 5000 points on Feb. 1.\nToday, \"we have gone through the 5500 barrier,\" noted ScotiaMcLeod's senior vice-president Fred Ketchen.\nAnother trader said: \"There seems.... to be foreign interest in Canada.\"\nOverseas investors are eyeing Canada's falling interest rates and declining deficit financing needs, analysts said.\nTrading volume totalled 858 million shares valued at C$1.25 billion (US$929 million).\nAdvancing issues beat out declining ones 561 to 420, while 276 traded unchanged.\nNine of Toronto's 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by the heavily weighted gold sector, which rose 1.2 percent, and the oil group which jumped 1.7 percent, along with stronger base metals and media issues.\nFalling groups included consumer products, conglomerates and forestry products.\nAmong Toronto's hot stocks were fertilizer firms. Viridian Inc. said it agreed to a friendly C$1.33 billion (US$988 million) merger with Agrium Inc.\nViridian shares jumped C$1.25 to C$17.75 on more than 4.1 million shares, while Agrium lost C$0.35 to hit C$18.55 in heavy dealings. The merger would create one of North America's largest integrated fertilizer firms.\nNickel giant Inco Ltd. jumped C$1.05 to C$41.80 in heavy trading, after it announced higher-than-expected third quarter earnings at US$0.19 a share compared to year-earlier US$0.33 a share.\nStampeder Exploration Ltd topped Toronto's most active stocks, rising C$0.10 to reach C$6.55.", "A strong showing in runoff Senate elections at the weekend may breathe new life into the Czech governing coalition, but it will do little to resuscitate the country's dormant capital market, analysts said on Sunday.\nThe minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.\nThe Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.\nBut analysts said that while the news could have been worse for investors, the strong centre-right showing does nothing to solve the maladies which continue to plague the market.\n\"I think the market's reaction will be fairly positive, but in a few weeks time it will probably have settled down into acknowledging that this has not changed the situation of the past four or five months at all,\" Charles Robinson of the research house HILFE told Reuters.\n\"It has just not made it worse,\" he added.\nThe coalition's strong showing in the first round of voting last week helped spur domestic investor interest, pushing the market up in its wake.\nAnalysts said, however, that with this fillip already built into prices, stocks will probably not rise too much further in the near future.\nThe Czech crown also gained some ground against its dollar/mark basket on the back of the first round results, but it too should not rise significantly on the final outcome of the vote, they added.\n\"It seems that the final results of the elections reflect the current structure of the political situation here so I don't expect any significant changes or amy development as a result of it,\" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.\nAnalysts said that until legislation is tightened to bring about more market transparency and stronger minority shareholder protection, key foreign investor interest will remain low.\n\"I think there has been a result built into the market from the good Senate results last week, and everyone expected that the coalition would win this second round,\" said one analyst.\n\"There are still other difficulties that will keep the market relatively depressed such as a lack of regulation that will keep foreign investors away. This is a more important issue over the medium-term than the Senate elections.\"", "International businessman Tony O'Reilly said on Friday acquisitions by his Independent Newspapers Plc will slow considerably next year after the takeover of New Zealand's leading newspaper and other deals.\n\"I consider next year a year of consolidation,\" Independent Newspapers Chairman O'Reilly told Reuters in a telephone interview.  \nBut O'Reilly's name came up just this week in London markets as the rumored buyer of Mirror Group Newspapers Plc's 46 percent stake in Britain's Independent Newspapers Plc.\nBoth Mirror Group and O'Reilly, whose separate, Dublin-based firm also owns a 46 percent stake in the British title, denied a deal was in the works.\nO'Reilly, best known in the United States as chairman of H.J. Heinz Co, also acknowledged his company was keeping a close eye on Australian media group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.  \nConrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon who runs Hollinger International Inc, sold a 20 percent stake in Fairfax this week after complaining about Australian limits on foreign ownership of newspaper companies.\nSome press reports suggest Fairfax might sell a top newspaper or become an acquisition target.\n\"The situation there is fluid, very interesting,\" O'Reilly said. \"You can just say the O'Reillys are looking on with interest.\"  \nNews Corp Ltd chairman Rupert Murdoch last month sold his five percent stake in Fairfax and on Wednesday said he had lost interest in the company because of the foreign ownership ceilings. A native Australian, Murdoch is now a U.S. citizen.\nIndependent Newspapers owns a 25 percent stake in the Australian regional newspaper company APN, and this year acquired a controlling 85 percent stake in Wilson & Horton in a deal valuing the leading New Zealand newspaper company at NZ$1.32 billion.  \n\"Wilson & Horton will be an important springboard for us,\" O'Reilly said.\nThe executive said the New Zealand company would help Independent expand its commercial printing and educational businesses in the region.\nO'Reilly said his executives next year would be working primarily on increasing results and efficiencies in Independent properties. Deals, in part because his family wishes to maintain its 28 percent equity stake in Independent, would be secondary.\nCompany results should be strong in 1997, he said.  \nThe company's South African properties will have to produce better than normal profit gains to offset currency losses expected from a drop in the South African rand, he said.\nIndependent's newspapers in Ireland, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere will benefit from a sharp drop in newsprint.

Bondholders will get from 93 to 95 percent of the $365 million they were owed, one banker said.\nExecutives say the new company will be profitable from the outset, with revenues estimated at $1.59 billion and net income at $31 million for its first full fiscal year beginning Dec. 1, according to bankruptcy court documents.\nThat compares with revenue of $2.72 billion and net income of $36 million in 1993, before the company reported losses that totalled more than $600 million over two years.\nAnalysts traced Morrison Knudsen's woes to a disastrous forway into railroads, including huge losses on bids to build new commuter transit cars, a business the company has exited.\nAgee's ambitious plan to build new locomotives from the ground up never materialised, and its minority stake in MK Rail Corp. is being distributed to bondholders.\nAgee himself, who once used a corporate jet to shuttle between Boise and his company-bought estate in Pebble Beach, Calif., was forced to give up some of his lucrative pension and severance benefits in a $63 million company settlement of class-action shareholder lawsuits.\nThe new Morrison will get about 90 percent of its revenues from three businesses -- industrial construction for Fortune 100 companies, heavy civil construction, and environmental remediation, mainly for government agencies, Tinstman said in an interview.\n\"Dennis very much wants this to be a well-balanced, diversified company,\" Tinstman said.\nThe remaining 10 percent of the company's business is mining.\nWashington, who usually stays behind the scenes at his companies, will help set strategy at the new Morrison Knudsen but will not have a day-to-day role, Tinstman said.\nMorrison Knudsen Chairman Robert Miller, who was brought in last year and is best known for helping to engineer Chrysler Corp.'s turnaround in the 1980s, will be vice chairman of the new company. The other vice chairman will be Washington aide Dorn Parkinson.", "Anti-government protests swept across Canada's biggest city on Friday as demonstrators in Toronto shut down the transit system, disrupted businesses and tried to break into the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\"We've come to the place where the real power is.... They get their power and strength from inside this building,\" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.\nDemonstrators chanted \"Shut it down, shut it down,\" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.\nProtest organisers later moved the rally away from the doors of the exchange.\nIn another part of the city, Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves said it was ironic that some of the groups that are protesting have huge pension funds that invest in stocks.\nProtesters hit Toronto streets, paralysing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.\nSubway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or just stay home.\nUnionized workers, civil servants and social activists also descended on government offices and factories in the first day of the so-called \"Days of Protest\" against budget cutbacks.\nBut picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Expected traffic jams on the city expressways also did not materialise.\nIn the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.\nAt least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.\nOther companies hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.\nThe protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.\nSince sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.\n\"These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,\" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.\nBut Harris, who has been dubbed \"Newt of the North\" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his \"Common Sense Revolution.\"\n\"Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,\" Harris told reporters.\nThe Conservatives' popularity has held at around 50 percent in recent opinion polls.\nMany commuters took the delays in stride.\n\"I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,\" said John Ivarey.\nA poll taken this week found that 67 percent of Toronto residents opposed the \"Days of Action\" rallies.\nProtesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence.\nOne man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station.\nSeveral major manufacturers cancelled day shifts.

The newspaper article said confidential Entergy company documents referred to used a code name \"Atlantic\" for the target company whose financial profile met that of London Electricity on a number of points.\nThe Journal said the bid was assumed in the documents to be for around 700 pence per share. The newspaper quoted Entergy's Sweeney as saying Entergy was interested in the British market and \"obviously if you're interested, one of the results could be an acquisition.\"", "Ford Motor Co joined other U.S. automakers Wednesday in their accelerating race to exit the battered car rental business.\nFord said it may sell its interests in Budget Rent a Car, the nation's sixth-largest rental car agency.\nIf a sale goes through, as analysts widely expect, Budget would be the fifth major agency to change hands since 1994.\n\"The reason is they're not making any money,\" said WEFA Group automotive consultant George Magliano in New York. \"Travel is hot, but the car rental business is going nowhere.\"  \nThat is not evident from the sudden interest shown in the $14-billion a year business by a new class of investors who are buying up the agencies as the automakers unload them.\n\"They see opportunity for profits. The industry is in a mild recovery and it's probably a better time to own a rental car agency than it has been for a long time,\" said Jon LeSage, editor of Auto Rental News, a trade journal in California.\nFord declined to comment specifically on a published report that it may sell Budget to Team Rental Group Inc, a Florida-based Budget licensee, for $350 million.\nA Team Rental spokesman also declined comment.  \n\"No agreements have been reached among any parties,\" said Budget spokeswoman Kimberly Mulcahy, declining further comment. She said Ford does not own Lisle, Ill.-based Budget outright, but controls the company through an option to purchase its common shares.\nFord said last year it would exercise its option and buy out Budget's common shares, but analysts said the deal looks shaky now after delays resulting from a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust review.  \nAs a result, A.G. Edwards auto analyst Michael Braigg in St. Louis said he expects Ford to sell Budget soon, likely to Team Rental. \"I think that one's pretty far along,\" he said.\n\"The real issue is that Budget is the small rental property of Ford. And if Budget is for sale, then so is Hertz in the long run,\" Braigg said.\nFord began investing in Hertz in 1987 at a time when U.S. automakers were buying up rental car agencies hoping to load up their fleets with the thousands of new cars that consumers were leaving on the lots.  \nThe strategy worked for a while, but then backfired when agency sales of barely used rental vehicles started eating into new car sales. Automakers began encouraging the agencies to hold onto fleet cars longer, which restricted how many new cars the agencies could take on.\nFord bought all of Hertz in 1994 and, unlike many rental car agencies, Hertz is probably profitable, analysts said.\nBut Magliano said, \"There is no big advantage to the automakers to owning these agencies anymore.... Probably along the way, Ford will sell Hertz. Generally, when these companies begin to divest operations, they get rid of them all.\"  \nReassured by a back-to-basics management trend running through U.S. industry, automakers started selling off rental car agencies in 1994 with Chrysler Corp's sale of Snappy Car Rental.\nGeneral Motors Corp in 1995 sold National Car Rental Systems Inc to private investors, who earlier this week resold National to Republic Industries Inc.\nSeeking to lock in supply for its fledgling AutoNation used-car chain, Atlanta-based Republic in November agreed to buy Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc.\nIn June last year, General Motors sold off its 29-percent interest in Avis Inc to HFS Inc, a real estate and hotel concern based in New Jersey.\nChrysler still owns Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car. \"Our status today is that Dollar and Thrifty are very much a part of our everyday business. It's business as usual,\" said Chrysler spokeswoman Lori McTavish.\nShe added, \"It is Chrysler's goal, however, to focus on our core automotive business.\"\nBased on U.S. vehicle fleet size, Auto Rental News ranks privately held Enterprise Rent-A-Car, of St. Louis, as the largest U.S. rental car agency, followed in order by Hertz, Avis, National, Alamo, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty.\nTogether, Enterprise, Hertz and Avis own half of the U.S. rental car fleet of about 1.5 million vehicles, according to the trade journal.", "A revolution in the treatment of HIV and AIDS is proving a godsend not just for patients but for drug companies which have poured millions of pounds into fighting the epidemic.\nCocktails of new and old drugs are resulting in dramatic improvements in both quality of life and life expectancy, with some patient groups forecasting that death rates from AIDS in Europe next year could fall by 50 percent.\nAnd as patients live longer and more people seek treatment at earlier stages of illness, drug companies like Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc are looking forward to a quantum leap in sales, with global turnover of AIDS and HIV products forecast to treble by the end of the century.\nAnalysts at Lehman Brothers expect sales of AIDS drugs at Glaxo Wellcome, which by a mixture of luck and good judgement holds two of the cornerstone drugs for combination therapy, to soar to around $2 billion by the end of the century from just $300 million in 1995.\nKeith Alcorn, who writes for the influential British newsletter AIDS Treatment Update, used by both patients and doctors, said: \"This year has been the most exceptional year in AIDS treatment yet, and the effects are very, very tangible. People are going back to work after being very ill and that in itself is quite unexpected.\"\nADVANCES REVIVE AZT\nAdvances have led to an extraordinary revival in the fortunes of Glaxo Wellcome's Retrovir. The drug, also known as AZT, was launched with a great fanfare in 1987, but its erratic performance disappointed patients and shareholders alike.\nDoctors have found that using Retrovir, which stops the HIV virus from replicating, in combination with other treatments such as Bristol Myers Squibb Co's Didanosine, Hoffmann-La Roche's Zalcitabine and above all a new Glaxo Wellcome drug called Epivir can radically cut levels of HIV in the blood.\nAnd preliminary evidence suggests the addition of a whole new class of drug, known as protease inhibitors, to the cocktail can produce even more sensational results, with the virus brought below detectable levels.\nLehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith said: \"Use of Retrovir alone had a relatively minimal and transient effect on CD4 cell levels (key cells which HIV destroys, undermining the immune system) and viral load. But in combination the impact on viral load and CD4 was nothing short of stunning compared to what we saw a few years ago.\"\nThe progress has electrified an industry that just two years ago was mired in gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in treating AIDS. Anita Kidgell, Glaxo Wellcome's antivirals product communication manager, said that when scientists, activists and drug companies met at the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, Canada, in July the atmosphere had been transformed.\n\"We were seeing that one could reduce the levels of the virus in patients' blood to undetectable levels,\" Kidgell said.\nFor the moment Glaxo Wellcome seems to have cornered the AIDS drug market, with Lehman predicting sales of Retrovir will double to $600 million by 1998 and that sales of Epivir, which Glaxo shrewdly licensed from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, will hit $750 million by 2000 from just $12 million in 1995.\nBut other companies are ahead of the British giant in developing protease inhibitors, the third element in the cocktail, which block an enzyme crucial to the spread of the HIV virus within the body.\nSome 20 protease inhibitors are being developed, and Merck & Co, Abbott Laboratories Inc and Roche Holdings AG have all rushed versions on to the market this year. The three companies are cautious about giving sales figures, but anecdotal evidence from patient groups together with U.S. sales data suggests that Merck's Crixivan is far outselling its rivals. Sales of this class of drug are likely to reach around $300 million this year.\nNOTE OF CAUTION\nBut while there is understandable euphoria over the progress made to date, Robin Gorna, director of health promotion at Britain's leading AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"We must be very cautious about saying everything is OK, we have got a cure.\" She said the mix of drugs taken by AIDS patients carry a raft of side effects and enforce a strict and life-changing dietary regime and timetable.\nThe explosion in effective treatment also has serious consequences for overstetched health and insurance budgets.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust estimates that costs to the British taxpayer in the year to March 1998 of treatment with Retrovir alone would be 10.3 million pounds ($17.29 million). Treatment with a combination of three drugs would bump this up to around 50 million. And if, as expected, more people are encouraged to come forward and seek treatment before they develop AIDS, this could rise to around 74 million pounds.\nGorna said stories already abounded of patients being unable to get the drugs they need, either though lack of funds or ignorance on the part of doctors. AIDS support groups and companies, who cooperate increasingly, say they have to persuade governments that extended treatment with drugs is much cheaper than costly hospital care and dealing with the multiple complications of AIDS.\n\"We are all very hopeful,\" said Gorna. \"It is looking good, but it really isn't over yet and we need drugs that are effective in the long term.\"", "The head of the Czech Republic's largest bank is on a crusade to clean up the emerging post-communist banking sector from within and, he hopes, from a seat in the Senate.\nDr Richard Salzmann, the bow-tied president of Komercni Banka, says the Czech banking system is fundamentally sound and getting stronger despite a handful of recent failures among smaller institutions.\nBut, he says, the whole Czech economy needed a dose of \"fairness and transparency\" to clean up old habits of secrecy and ensure banks are not run as private fiefdoms.\nHe is standing for a seat in the newly-established Czech Senate at elections in November, saying he wants to help bring back \"good manners\" to the banking industry and restore the reputation of the Czech finance sector.\nBetter risk management is crucial, according to Salzmann.\nHe said that Komercni and the three other large banks -- which comprise about 80 percent of all Czech banking activity -- had bolstered their reserves to meet Western banking standards, and had developed more effective risk management techniques.\n\"As concerns \"The Big Four', (the situation) is, for sure, very good, because all these big four banks in the last years have built up huge reserves,\" Salzmann said during a visit to the PGA Czech Open golf tournament here recently.\n\"It's true that we have an unusually high proportion of risky loans in our portfolios, which is partially inherited from the past. Other (bad loans) were made in this era of euphoria, after the (1989 revolution ending Communism).\"\nHe said from branches to front office, Komercni has stepped up risk management techniques which have now been also adopted by Ceska Sporitelna,  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, and Investicni a Postovni Banka -- the others in \"The Big Four\".\n\"Now we are in the final stage when we are building a central risk assessment department, which supervises all kinds of risks, not only from credit but also from the capital market operations and from the foreign operations.\"\nFAILURES EXPOSE PROBLEMS\nSalzmann said he believed the recent failure of Kreditni Banka a.s., a medium-sized bank which became the eighth to shut in the post-communist era, stemmed, like others before it, from greed and naivete.\n\"I would blame mostly the founders of the banks, because they provided for themselves various kinds of privileges. They were, in most cases in my opinion, those who did not come with the intention to rob the money and disappear or something like that, I don't say that,\" Salzmann contended.\n\"But many of them founded the bank with false ideas that (their) bank would be able to provide themselves with easier conditions and lower prices for money for their internal use.\"\nSalzmann said these bad lending practices spiraled until the banks were forced to raise their rates and tighten lending conditions for regular customers.\n\"This snowballed from the naivete at the beginning,\" he said.\nKreditni suffered losses reportedly at more than 10 billion Czech crowns ($381.1 million) through a series of large loan defaults and on August 8 the central bank withdrew its banking licence.\nThe local press has been ripe with allegations of mismanagement and murky loan operations at many of the failed institutions, but criminal investigations have yet to produce any charges.\nOfficials from Kreditni Banka have refused to comment on reasons for its failure, but its controlling shareholder, the large insurer Ceska Pojistovna, chalked it up simply to bad decisions by bank management on loans and loan guarantees.\nSalzmann, 67, said problems in the banking system were part of a bigger problem of honesty and fairness throughout the economy.\nHe said that if elected, he would push to expand the enforcement power of regulators to police dubious practices in banks, investment funds, and on the capital market, which is consistently hampered by charges of insider trading.\nBANKER SEEKS POLITICAL PLATFORM\n\"My (candidacy), is to bring to this freshly-introduced capitalism more decency...a better field for good business,\" said Salzmann.\nThe erudite banker, who often recalls the days of thriving Czech capitalism between wars, said he would work in the Senate to establish an independent capital market watchdog like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSalzmann resigned as the chairman of the Prague Stock Exchange earlier this year -- a mostly honorary position -- to allow his friend and party colleague Tomas Jezek to take over as a full-time, hands-on leader of the bourse.\nBoth Jezek and Salzmann will run for the Senate in separate constituencies, and both support starting up a market-supported watchdog beefed up from the currently understaffed and underfunded Finance Ministry regulation department.\nBut Salzmann, who said he cannot by contract retire from the bank for at least one more year, rejects charges that his membership in the Senate while heading the country's largest banking group would constitute a conflict of interest. There is no legal requirement in the Czech Republic for legislators to suspend their business interests when they enter parliament.\nSalzmann insists he would never use his Senate seat to gain advantages for his bank, but he makes no apologies about using his seat to try to improve the banking and business environment overall.\n\"I will support all such measures to bring more fairness, decency, good manners, transparency, all those principals which are, of course, favourable for the banks. So in that sense I will be perhaps in a conflict of interest,\" Salzmann said.\nWhen asked if that meant he would support laws which would separate the banks and their investment arms, many of which control major chunks of the Czech economy -- like at Komercni Banka -- Salzmann answered:", "Britain's Northern Electric is set to rush out a glowing set of figures aimed at persuading the market that the 630 pence per share hostile bid by CE Electric is too low, analysts said on Friday.\nThe regional electricity company (Rec) said it would bring its half-year results forward from a scheduled date of December 5 when it rejected U.S.-based CE Electric's bid on Monday. Industry sources expect the results to come some time next week.\nNorthern could boost its case with an improved gearing forecast after a 560 million pound ($918.6 million) package for shareholders which helped it fend off last year's bid from Trafalgar House.\n\"The critical answer is interim results, especially the balance sheet, which could be stronger than expected,\" said David Campbell of Greig Middleton.\nNorthern has said that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had indicated a price of 700 pence per share, but that claim was denied by the Americans, who said their $1.225 billion bid was a full and fair price.\nSince the bid on Monday, there have been no further talks between the companies, industry sources said, and CE Electric has snapped up around 13 percent of Northern's shares.\nThe share price has struggled to rise above the offer level, which was at a premium of 21.2 percent to the last closing prices before the bid, and On Friday was trading at 631.5 pence, down two pence.\n\"I think Northern should be able to force a higher price but the critical factor is portfolio investors, who may prefer an instant 630 pence rather than a possible higher number,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\nNorthern's costly defence against Trafalgar House, the only successful rebuttal by any of the eight Recs which have faced bids since privatisation in 1990, has left it with little more to offer, analysts said, which could keep a lid on the shares.\nThere is also scepticism a rival bid will emerge, as the remaining four independent and cash-rich Recs could be more attractive without the operational rationale of CE Electric, which wants to add supply expertise to its generating business.\nElectricity sector shares were led higher last Friday by East Midlands Electricity, which was seen as the most attractive bid candidate before CE Electric launched its offer for Northern.\nNorthern is likely to report pretax profits slightly down at around 50 million pounds from 58.7 million pounds a year ago and raise the dividend by seven percent to near 13 pence.\nGearing could come in around 125 percent and show signs of falling to 100 percent or less, analysts said, from peaks nearer 170 percent under the impact of the costly defence package.\nThe market is also waiting for CE Electric, in which U.S. construction, mining and telecoms company Peter Kiewit Sons has a 30 percent stake, to post its offer document. This move will set the 60-day clock ticking for the takeover timetable.\nAt the same time, electricity industry watchdog Offer has started a review of the bid, requesting comments by November 7.\nAnalysts said Offer's move might have contributed to dampening Northern's share price by triggering concerns the bid might be referred to British competition authorities.\nThere appears to be little precedent for such a referral, however, as three Recs have already fallen to U.S. companies with approval from the government.\nBut last week's surprise decision to block rival bids for water utility South West Water from its colleagues Severn Trent and Wessex has unsettled the market, analysts said.\nThe Conservative government, well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls with no more than six months to go before a general election, might see Northern's takeover as a political hot potato.\nLabour, traditionally against privatisation and fiercely critical of takeovers in the sector, might take an additional interest in Northern as it supplies the party leader Tony Blair's constituency in north east England.", "More foreign firms are finally beginning to realise the dream of the China market that has long tantalised traders -- selling goods to the world's largest slice of mankind and making money from it.\nMany foreign companies remain stuck in China ventures that are loss-making and frustrating, but the number turning a profit or at least gaining solid market share is increasing, along with the market, according to analysts and businessmen.\nIn the 16 or so years since China opened its doors to the global economy, the country has become the second-biggest recipient of foreign investment funds in the world, after the United States.\nForeign brands such as Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lux soap have become household names throughout China, and the shelves of convenience stores from Harbin to Hainan are stuffed with foreign brand soaps, chocolates and cigarettes.\nPERSISTENCE PAYS OFF\n\"Overall more and more companies are coming, which is not necessarily to say they're making money yet,\" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai. \"But there's now a general view that there's not only great potential but also an increasingly good track record for companies that have persisted.\"\n\"You can now see that if you stick it out, you can make money and you can get good market share. Coca-Cola is now a household name thoughout China,\" he added.\nCoca-Cola came back to China after a 30-year absence in 1979, and the company booked its first accounting profit for its China operations 11 years later, said John Farrell, head of China operations.\n\"You cannot afford not to be in China. It's just the reality of opening a country of this size and the size of the economy and population,\" Farrell said.\n\"But it takes a lot of patience and you need to be very diligent to build your business. It's not easy by any means.\"\nCoca-Cola has 18 bottling plants across China, and with sales volume doubling every three years this is just the beginning.\nCoca-Cola declines to say just how profitable the China market is. Like most other companies, it does not issue figures on its China operations.\nMARCHING WITH THE CONSTRAINTS\n\"You have to march along with the constraints that you're given,\" Farrell said.\n\"The main thing for us was living up to the commitments we'd made on building plants, transferring technology and training people. The more we did that, the longer we did that, the more people would believe and trust us and allow us to expand a little bit more.\"\nAmong the sectors that have done well so far are communications equipment firms, such as Motorola and Ericsson, and low-priced consumer product makers.\n\"Generally speaking, the easiest place to make a profit tends to be in the consumer industry, usually fairly small-scale operations,\" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\"That is, assuming the deal is done right,\" she added.\nThere are big variations on market access and ease of business for foreign companies depending on the sector they are trying to storm.\nThe restraints are few in areas such as consumer products, while in sectors such as banking, distribution and insurance, foreign firms are kept on a very tight leash.\nBIGGER INVESTMENT EQUALS BIGGER RISK\nOverall, companies involved in high-cost, long-term projects seem to bear a proportionately bigger risk, analysts said.\n\"Big heavy industry projects are a problem,\" said one foreign broker in Shanghai.\n\"Generally foreign businesses in trouble have a bad business plan, or they're doing things which China is not famous for -- like trying to build aeroplanes or something.\"\nThe automobile industry has seen its share of troubles for foreign firms who have ventured in.\nChrysler Corp had a famously difficult relationship when it set up a joint venture in Beijing in the early 1980s, and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen is looking at closing one of its two China plants.\n\"We're having some difficulties -- all Western carmarkers are having difficulties in China,\" said a Peugeot official in early December.\nGeneral Motors, which has been close to completing negotiations for a $1 billion automobile factory in Shanghai for months, is well behind schedule on its plans and could have trouble ever making a profit in China, according to some analysts.\n\"It's going to be very difficult for them to make money. But they're coming in because they feel they have no choice,\" said the Western diplomat. \"It they don't do the deal, Ford will.\"\nHong Kong and Taiwan businessman have generally done much better in their investments than non-Chinese, said a representative for a Hong Kong trading group in Shanghai.\n\"But more people make money than they would admit,\" he added. \"People find ways to shift profits to Hong Kong or from one company to another to make things look like break-even.\"\nCHOOSING MARKET SHARE OVER PROFITS\nMaking money is anyway not a top priority for many companies in the China market, at least in the initial stages. Many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.\nThe Canadian insurance company Manulife, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years.\n\"Many companies are ploughing everything back into expansion and advertising,\" said a Western diplomat. \"In many cases, headquarters doesn't care if you make money, it's whether you're getting greater market share.\"\n\"If you're a global company you have to be here, and the potential risk of not being here is greater than losing your shirt for a while when you come in,\" said Richard Graham, representative of ING Barings in Shanghai.\nSuccess and failure for a foreign company in China is also closely related to who they work with.\n\"The reasons for people failing are usually related to joint venture problems. Choosing the wrong partner is the source of a lot of difficulties,\" the diplomat said.\nBut analysts said profits and market share aside, major advances have been made by foreign firms in recent years in the areas of experience and staffing.\n\"There are many companies now which have a lot of experience of operations in China, their staff are more used to operating in Chinese ways, and local staff are more used to operating under international practice,\" said Barings' Graham.\n\"This should allow them to go forward more positively.\"", "The Czech Republic could have a 50,000- 100,000 tonne sugar surplus from this year's campaign but little will be exported due to high local production costs and a world sugar surplus, sugar experts say.\nThe Agriculture Ministry said the state would buy some surplus sugar for strategic reserves and would prepare indirect support for exporters but it ruled out direct export subsidies.\nIndustry sources varied in their assesment of potential foreign markets but agreed producers will try to sell as much as they can at home as world prices were considerably lower.\n\"It is expected that the surplus will be up to 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes,\" said Eva Divisova of the ministry, adding that total production will be between 520,000 and 540,000 tonnes raw value after last campaign's 460,035 tonnes.\nShe added net sugar exports should be about 4,000 tonnes. Divisova declined to say how much the state would buy for its reserves, nor what the reserves are, saying this was secret.\n\"State reserves will be filled, other parts will have to be exported. But it is very difficult to get to foreign markets,\" Divisova added.\nShe said Slovakia was not importing due to higher output. There are payment problems with Ukraine and Russia, but former Yugoslav countries were potentially interesting, she said.\nDirector of trading firm Agrointernational Petr Prochazka believed the surplus would total 50,000-80,000 tonnes, most of which would stay in the Czech Republic.\n\"The surplus will not be so dramatic...There are quite good yields but the harvest is going slowly due to bad weather. A forecast freeze and subsequent warming will limit output.\"\n\"Producers will not want to export...(because of low prices) Those who can store it, will, he told Reuters, adding he believed the state could buy up to 20,000 tonnes for reserves.\nSecretary of the Sugar Refiners' Association Vladimir Ulrich also saw a 50,000-80,000-tonne surplus but said it could be partially swallowed by the state and the elasticity of domestic consumption. But he stressed that financial costs of storing sugar could push producers to sell at any price.\nUlrich said local prices have dropped to 12-15 crowns per kilo from 16 earlier in the year. The market is protected by a 68.4 percent tariff, which will drop next year to 65 percent.\n\"We are pushed from two sides -- the domestic surplus and low price on the world market. If prices drop further, other sugar could get here,\" Ulrich told Reuters.\nBreweries could buy up to 10,000 tonnes more than they usually do if prices go below the costs of malt, and citric acid makers could take care of another 10,000 tonnes, Ulrich said.\n\"There is a hunger for sugar in Bulgaria, Romaina, Ukraine, also in Russia,\" said Ulrich. He added that Poland, which itself expects to have a sizeable surplus, was also a potential market.\n\"We also cannot expect to supply the London exchange, because our sugar does not meet the conditions,\" he noted.\nHe said Cezch exporters could also look to traditional markts like Saudi Arabia...\"Of course, the price would be poor.\"\nThe ministry and Ulrich said the surplus would lead to a smaller sown area next year after 104,115 hectares this year. \"I believe the optimal area for next few years would be between 90,000 and 94,000 hectares,\" Ulrich said.", "Many personal computer makers this week will roll out flashy multimedia PCs designed around a new chip by Intel Corp. -- a development that is expected to give the consumer sector of the industry a much-needed boost.\nIntel will officially launch its much-anticipated P55C microprocessor using its so-called MMX (multimedia extension) technology Wednesday and a slew of companies will unveil new consumer PCs, notebooks and desktops using the new chip, which will offer much faster performance.\nThe company said the new chip will offer more than just faster speeds on the new PCs, but a spokesman declined to give any further details.\n\"Instead of just raw performance.... you get a richer experience,\" said an Intel spokesman in Santa Clara, Calif.\nInternational Business Machines Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Gateway 2000 Inc., Toshiba America Corp., Sony Corp. and many other firms are expected to unveil new high-end PCs simultaneously with Intel's announcment.\nMost machines are expected to be priced over $3,000.\nIntel said that an MMX-based PC would be more like a television, with sharper images, three-dimensional graphics, faster audio and television-like video. Other benefits include faster video teleconferencing and Internet access.\n\"As more and more people use PCs, the expectations are higher and higher, from what they see in movies and television,\" the Intel spokesman said.\n\"This moves the PC platform a little further along to media-rich applications. Our goal is to surpass the TV in terms of audio and video.\"\nFor example, he said, a user playing a video game on an MMX-based PC will feel as if he or she is in a video arcade.\n\"It's a tremendous kickoff to 1997,\" said Rod Schrock, a vice president of Compaq's Presario division.\n\"We are so excited about the new MMX processor that we redesigned the entire line of Presarios from the ground up. Customers are going to get a pretty dazzling experience.\"\nSchrock declined to give any product specifics, but he said that Compaq will launch its new Presario consumer PCs with MMX in the same timeframe as Intel's announcement.\n\"It should provide an added boost to the demand for the new generation of PCs,\" Schrock added. \"There was no major industry event in 1996, this year you have a new processor.\"", "Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV said Friday it agreed to pay $1.9 billion to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp, which owns the seventh-largest savings bank in the United States and the biggest in Michigan.\nABN AMRO, which already has a U.S. banking arm, the LaSalle group, said it was offering $59 a share for Standard Federal, a bank holding company with $15.5 billion in assets based in Troy, Mich.\nSFB owns Standard Federal Bank, a large home mortgage lender in Michigan that operates about 180 bank branches and 11 home lending centres. It also operates a wholesale mortgage banking business.\nDespite the offer, SFB stock fell after running up sharply in recent days on takeover speculation. Some investors were disappointed the price was not higher, analysts said.\n\"All the people were really speculating yesterday that it was a lot higher are selling today because they're disappointed,\" said Tony Howard, analyst at Olde Discount Corp.\nSFB stock lost $1.625 to $56.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nStandard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said at a news conference that ABN AMRO had made the highest bid for the bank among several serious suitors.\n\"We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,\" Carley told reporters.\nABN AMRO, the Netherlands' leading bank, said it would issue $750 million in preferred stock to help fund the acquisition, its biggest to date. It said it would issue the shares through a U.S. subsidiary, ABN AMRO North America Inc.\nFormed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO already is the biggest foreign bank in the United States. Its LaSalle group has 130 branches and 7,750 staff members, mainly in the Chicago area.\nThe agreement marks ABN AMRO North America Inc.'s sixth acquisition in three years and is likely to be the last for a while, ABN AMRO North America Chief Executive Officer Harrison Tempest said at a news conference.\n\"We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,\" Tempest said. When asked how long before it might make another deal, he said, \"probably two years.\"\nThe combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, ABN AMRO said.\n\"It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,\" Tempest said.\nSFB employs about 4,000 people and serves 1 million clients in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.\nABN AMRO said Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and there would be \"significant cost savings\" following the deal.\nWhile saying no jobs would be cut initially, both companies said some job cuts were likely eventually as administrative functions and some branches were consolidated.\nWith Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market.\nAnalysts said recent changes in U.S. banking law that will level the playing field between thrifts and banks should help speed other acquisitions of savings and loans.\n\"I think you're going to see an increased level of activity, both in banks acquiring thrifts and thrifts acquiring thrifts,\" said Jonathon gray, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co.\nABN AMRO said it had reached agreement with Standard Federal's board, but the deal still needed the approval of its shareholders and supervisory authorities.\nThe acquisition was expected to be completed by mid-1997, ABN said, adding that the deal would contribute to its earnings.", "China on Wednesday gave Hong Kong a free hand to arrange media coverage of the colony's historic handover to Beijing, ending fears that the country's communist rulers might restrict press access.\nChinese and British negotiators working on details of Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty announced the agreement after their latest round of talks.\n\"We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press and the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony,\" Hugh Davies, British team chief at the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters.\nThe JLG negotiates the fine details of the transfer of the territory of 6.4 million people to Chinese rule.\nMany in Hong Kong, including human rights activists and pro-democracy politicians, had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists attended.\nIn a joint statement both countries said arrangements for media coverage would be made by the Hong Kong government.\n\"The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony,\" the statement said.\nApplication forms for media accreditation will be distributed by the Hong Kong government's Handover Ceremony Coordination Office from March 15 and should be returned before April 7.\nHong Kong, a British colony for over 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, and the government expects 6,000 foreign and local media representatives to cover the event.\nAsked if the Hong Kong government would set any special conditions for accreditation, Davies said he did not envisage applicants being turned down.\n\"There will be no criteria applied.... provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist,\" he told reporters.", "A top executive at Compaq Computer Corp. said Thursday he was leaving the world's biggest personal computer maker and joining an Internet startup, giving credibility to the startup and setting in motion a realignment of Compaq's sales managers.\nThe executive, Ross Cooley, is leaving a position where he was in charge of Compaq's $7 billion North American computer business for a job at a four-month-old company with the high-tech name of pcOrder.com\nAt pcOrder.com, Cooley, 55, will fill the as-yet unfilled positions of chairman and chief executive officer and have a salary of $1 a year, plus stock options.\nHis move from an executive suite at a Fortune 500 company to a technology startup mirrors that of several other executives over the past few years, notably, the departure of Alex Mandl from AT&T earlier this year.\nCooley's move provides instant credibility to pcOrder.com, which provides a marketplace on the Internet for buying and selling personal computers and related equipment.\nCooley's retirement had been rumored in the industry for several months, and Compaq announced that James Schraith, formerly president of The Cerplex Group Inc. and president of AST Research Inc., is replacing Cooley.\n\"Ross's plan to retire has been in discussion for awhile and there were some rumors flying,\" Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO of Compaq, said in an interview. \"The time has come and obviously as you can see the succession is already in place.... Ross has been a great leader.\"\nAt the same time, Compaq created a new sales infrastructure, hiring Richard Snyder, a Dell Computer Corp. executive, for a newly-created position of general manager, worldwide sales. All the heads of Compaq's five geographical sales regions -- Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Japan, Latin America and North America -- will report to him.\nPreviously, these regions all reported directly to Pfeiffer. But as Compaq has quickly grown to an almost $18 billion company in recent years, Pfeiffer said he needs another executive to stay in touch with the day-to-day activities of its worldwide sales and support organization.\n\"Fifteen people have been reporting to me up until this morning when we announced this change,\" Pfeiffer said. \"That is a huge top management organization. As the company grows, my tasks change.\"\nCompaq has grown from its origins as one of the first companies to successfully clone the IBM PC in the early 1980s to become the leading PC maker in the world. Cooley is known for his strong relationships with the PC sales channel and his role in building Compaq's massive distribution.\n\"My feelings in joining pcOrder are similar to those I had in joining Compaq almost 13 years ago,\" Cooley said in a statement. \"Back then, I saw the irrefutable logic of the PC as a new paradigm in computing. Today, I believe pcOrder's technology and vision represent an irrefutable value proposition.\"\nBefore joining Compaq in 1984, Cooley held several sales and marketing positions at International Business Machines Corp., where he worked for 18 years.\n\"Getting Cooley is really a coup for pcOrder,\" said John McCarthy, a Forrester Research analyst, adding that Cooley's connections in PC distrubution will give pcOrder more credibility as it builds its system. Cooley's acceptance of $1 a year for salary, plus stock options, is also a \"big bet on the company's upside (potential),\" McCarthy said.\npcOrder for now is still private, but the company is contemplating a public offering eventually.\n\"We do not have a set plan or a set timetable, but we are seriously considering it,\" said founder and President Christina Jones. Jones will continue as president of pcOrder. The post of chairman and CEO had been vacant since the start-up was founded in June.\npcOrder.com is a marketplace on the Internet, where PC makers, components makers and distributors list information and receive orders.\nCurrently, sales representatives and customers user pcOrder to configure build-to-order PCs, compare prices, and place orders over the Internet.

Chairman Louis Gerstner on Wednesday warned the computer industry of a backlash against the Internet as confusion and feuding reigns among corporate rivals.\n\"A lot of what has gone on is just plain confusing,\" Gerstner said in a keynote speech at the Internet World trade show in New York. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see an Internet backlash soon.\"\nHe said industry wars over Internet browser software, programming languages, hardware and continuing hype may contribute to corporate and consumer disillusionment about the Internet.\n\"As an industry, we are not shy about telling people how beautiful our babies are, long before they are born,\" Gerstner said, adding that customers have to sort out the hype and \"food fights\" by sparring companies.\nGerstner said many were wondering where money is to be made on the Internet amid what he characterised as hype that seems to be leaving out customers and their needs.\n\"People ask'Is there real money to be made on the Internet?' and I say,'Yes there is,'\" Gerstner said, adding that money will be made by companies that can solve customers' problems and make it easy to do things like banking on the Internet.\nGerstner said IBM's approach to the Internet was to work closely with customers and develop the products they need, such as its work with the discount brokerage Charles Schwab, which now offers stock trading over the Internet.\n\"Schwab expects to capture as many customers with the Internet over the next year as they have over the past 13 years,\" Gerstner said.\nOne of the industry \"food fights\" that Gerstner singled out was Microsoft Corp.s effort to develop software based on Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java language to design programmes that only run on Microsoft's Windows operating system.\nThe Java language has been much heralded in the computer industry because of its \"write-once, run-anywhere\" capability, which lets programmes written in Java run on any computer system. Because of this feature, Java has become a popular programming language for the Internet and networked computers.\n\"Let's not blow this,\" Gerstner said. \"Let's not do to Java what the industry did to Unix,\" the high-performance operating system which splintered off into more than 20 versions.\nAt Internet World on Wednesday, Sun Microsystems unveiled an alliance with IBM and other major companies, which are all backing a move to standardise and certify one version of the Java language.\n\"Gerstner is taking his guidance from customers and not from industry conflicts,\" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant based in Scarsdale, N.Y. \"He did a lot to de-hype the industry.\"\nGerstner also reiterated his plea that the industry make things easier for users. He showed a video of IBM's voice recognition technology, which enables computer users to give simple commands to surf the World Wide Web.\nHe said IBM's voice recognition software for the Internet is now available in beta, or experimental form, and that users could download it for free, starting Wednesday, from IBM's Web site, http://www.ibm.com.", "Storage Technology Corp on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with the Swedish patent office for the sale of a disc-based storage system and was in talks with the Chinese patent office about a similar deal.\nThe two events follow an earlier system sale to the European Patent Office, based in The Hague.\n\"It's too early to talk about the details of the Chinese deal, we are still in discussions. It can still take some time before we have a contract,\" Campbell McGarvie, vice-president Europe, Africa and Midle East, said in an interview.\nHe gave no financial details of the Swedish deal.\nStorageTek, based in Louisville, Colorado, specialises in the storage and retrieval of digital information and increasingly is moving away from digital documents to bit-map images. Bit-map images are digital pictures. Bit-map images open up the possibility of storing medical scans or video images. Potential users of StorageTek's new products are members of the medical profession or broadcasters.\nStorageTek has disc-based products as well as tape-based products. In tape, it makes products for such companies as Siemens and Cie des Machines Bull.\nOn August 19, the company signed a deal with AT&T Corp's NCR unit under which NCR will market its Timberwolf tape system, a system for storing information.\nBut the NCR deal is less far reaching than a June 10 deal with International Business Machines Corp under which StorageTek will make IBM branded products.\nThe U.S. Justice Department is investigating the deal and in particular is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage devices industry. Pending completion of the probe, the deal cannot be finalised. Earlier this month, both StorageTek and IBM have said the inquiry was routine and expected.\nFinancial analysts say that, should the deal go through, it could add hundreds of millions of dollars to StorageTek's revenues.\n\"That was a major deal, it was big change for IBM. Never before had IBM allowed another company to build such major components as storage facilities,\" McGarvie said.\nAccording to the IDC research buro, StorageTek had an 11 percent share of the disc-based storage market in the first quarter of 1996 while IBM had a 30 percent stake.\nShould the deal go through, the two companies would hold just under half of the market, estimated for 1997 at 3,500 terrabytes (one thousand mega bytes), valued at $3.5 billion. The combined market share could grow to more than 50 percent in the next few years.\nEMC Corp is currently market leader with 43 percent, and Japan's Hitachi Ltd Hitachi Data has a share of over 11 percent.\n\"The deal is mutually exclusive. IBM will also fund our research and while we begin with the Iceberg product it will also involve new products,\" McGarvie said. The Iceberg, a StorageTek product, is a storage system for discs.\nStorageTek's Toulouse facility in France, opened in June 1995, will make IBM-branded products and the deal is expected to speed up the unit's expansion.\nAt Toulouse, some 100 people work on manufacturing and research and development. Storagetek is committed to increase this to 470 people within four years and McGarvie said that this would now easily be met, probably sooner than in four years.\nIn the medical imaging and video market, StorageTek sees a lot of opportunities but for the moment it has not yet signed big deals. \"We are in discussions for some deals which could be concluded next year,\" French marketing manager Eric Debray said.\nOn a horizon of five to 10 years, McGarvie believes the company could reap benefits from the Internet and Intranet online network services, coupling its storage facilities to online retrieval systems.\nStorageTek acquired the company Network Systems about a year ago. This company offers network solutions as well as security products such as Borderguard, which is a \"firewall\" products.\nA firewall shields sensitive internal computer information from the public internet and aims to prevent hackers from breaking into commercially vital information data bases.\n\"It's one of the main worries at the moment. Many companies want to go on the net but they fear that they will open up their internal systems to possible intrusion,\" McGarvie said.", "Russia's untapped gold reserves are unlikely to become the El Dorado of the East soon despite Moscow's promises to liberalise the tightly-controlled sector, precious metals sources said on Wednesday.\nRussia's Central Bank said earlier this week it was gearing up to create a domestic gold market via measures that would make it worthwhile for Russian commercial banks to finance mining.\nBut industry sources said the rules would do little to reform the world's fifth-largest gold producer with the world's third-largest reserves.\n\"It will take quite a while for commercial banks to take much of that market,\" said analyst Tony Warwick-Ching of CRU International in London.\nThe Central Bank's new rules would allow banks to trade gold domestically in a limited way through special precious metal accounts and to make and secure limited, gold-backed loans.\n\"Well, if after two and a half years, the central bank has come up with accounting procedures for gold transactions, then that is very good,\" said Yuri Kotlyar, acting chairman of the State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones (Komdragmet), whose functions are being reorganised.\n\"But this has nothing to do with creating an actual market, and that is what we need.\"\nRussia's gold mines, even those run by foreign joint ventures, are required to sell their output to the state at fixed prices and are usually paid many months later.\nThe government, in a budget crisis and facing a tax revenue shortfall, has even less money this year to finance output and 1996 production will not better 1995's poor 125-132 tonnes.\nCommercial banks financed only about five tonnes of output last year. Moscow has promised but done little to let banks with special licences take gold abroad to secure financing.\nAnalysts said Moscow feared losing control of its gold industry, which would be harder to track than other key sectors.\n\"The history of the (Russian) industry is partly driven by politics, not economics,\" said analyst Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland in London.\nOthers said a tug-of-war for control was scaring investors.\nThe Central Bank, which shares responsibility for gold reserves with the Finance Ministry, wants more control over more gold reserves to support the rouble in the future.\nBut Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister German Kuznetsov as saying the ministry, not the Central Bank, should have first crack at buying output and the state, not the private sector, should finance most mining.\nTotal, unspecified volume of Russian gold mined over January-September was nine-percent below year-ago levels, the State Statistics Committee said. Mining season ends in October as freezing weather emerges in Siberia and Russia's Far East.\nAnd Russia will literally have to dig deep to tap its reserves. More than three quarters of Russian gold is in below-ground ore deposits.\nMore than half of all foreign-backed gold projects in the former Soviet Union are in Russia.\nBut none of the big ones, including the giant Sukhoi Log, the world's largest unmined reserve with a possible 1,800 tonnes, are at the production stage because of tax and royalty quibbles with the government.", "France announced plans to create a major new force in the world defence industry on Wednesday, by selling state-owned defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic franc.\nThe government said it had preferred the bid by Lagardere, which owns defence company Matra, to the rival offer of largely civilian industrial group Alcatel Alsthom SA.\n\"The choice I made yesterday and which has been made public today is entirely based on a defence industrial logic,\" Prime Minisiter Alain Juppe told parliament\n\"We have opted for the offer which was the best to further our defence interest and which would constitute a world leading industrial group with strong export capacities,\" he said.\n\"The offers were comparable on a financial level. They both needed a capital increase,\" Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told a news conference. The state will make an 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) cash injection to Thomson SA prior to the sale.\nChallenged in parliament about the cash injection, Arthuis said that \"Both Alcatel and Lagardere valued Thomson SA at minus 11 billion francs\"\nLoss-making Thomson SA owns 58 percent of defence electronics company Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics maker Thomson Multimedia which specialises in digital television and decoders and has Saba and RCA as brands.\nLagardere said it is bidding 156 francs a share, or 7.8 billion francs in total, to buy the minorities in Thomson-CSF which it will then merge with Matra. Lagardere will keep 60 percent of Thomson Matra while the French state will have a golden share to safeguard national security interests.\nLagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.\nThe government said Daewoo was a well known investor in France and had knowledge of mass production techniques. Daewoo has made commitments on jobs -- creating 3,000 new jobs in France -- technology and investments.\nThomson Multimedia management will remain French-based.\nArthuis said the European Commission would have to approve the cash injection and study competition issues. He said the sale would take place before the end of the year and the cash for the injection would come from other privatisations.\nThe independent privatisation commission, which has an important say in the sale of state assets, still has to give its advice on the sale. Arthuis said the government had not wanted to keep its choice secret, as would have been usual, until the privatisation commission's advice \"to avoid insider trading\".\nThe decision was a surprise as markets and the media had gambled Alcatel's no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk would take the prize over self-made entrepreneur Jean-Luc Lagardere, 69, who is preparing to hand over power to his son, Arnaud.\nLagardere also owns publishers Hachette and Filipachi.\nThomson SA lost 1.379 billion francs in 1995 and has 25 billion francs of debt. Wholly-owned Thomson Multimedia lost three billion in the first half of 1996, but Thomson-CSF is profitable and had 1995 earnings of 1.01 billion francs.\nThe government said Lagardere wanted to leave the share capital of microelectronics maker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV by selling its 20 percent stake to the other main shareholders. France Telecom said it and CEA Industries were ready to buy that stake and keep French interests at the same level as the stake of Italian companies.\nAlcatel's shares rose sharply on Thursday morning on market relief. Analysts doubted its capacity to finance the Thomson deal. Lagardere shares were suspended for the day.", "A U.S. defence team found human remains and parts of an American bomber on Tuesday after making its way up a steep mountain slope in southwestern China to inspect a recently found World War Two crash site.\nThe officials clawed their way up the slippery, granite face of Maoer mountain in Guangxi province and pronounced the mission a success despite the injury in a fall of a U.S. reporter accompanying them.\n\"We consider this a very successful mission,\" said Alan Liotta, deputy director of the MIA/POW (Missing in Action/Prisoner of War) office under the Department of Defence.\nSpeaking to reporters in the town of Xingan after returning from the site late on Tuesday, he said findings confirmed information about the fatal crash that occurred on August 31, 1944.\nThe B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned from a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan.\n\"Any step that we can take to bring a case closer to resolution and to provide a family some answers...indeed gives us some satisfaction,\" Liotta told reporters.\nThe six-man forensic team from the Department of Defence flew into the Guangxi region on Monday to try to recover remains and learn more about the crash.\nLocal residents, searching for wild herbs in the region's thick forest, discovered the crash site last October.\nU.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\nChinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.\nChinese authorities will turn over some of the remains later on Wednesday and a formal ceremony is to be held in Beijing on Friday.\nThe human remains would be taken back to the United States for identification, Liotta said.\nThe U.S. team's elation at reaching what was left of the bomber was dulled by an injury to Voice of America journalist Stephanie Ho who was knocked unconscious briefly after she slipped 75 metres (yards) down a slope returning from the site.\nHo lost her footing as she made her way across the moss-covered face of the mountain. A doctor at the scene said her injury was not serious but she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city of Guilin.\n\"This was extremely treacherous terrain and a very difficult climb,\" said Liotta.\nJournalists who made the trek to the site saw a pile of charred and twisted metal wedged into a narrow crevass on the mountain side. Higher up the slope was a chunk of the plane's fuselage along with part of an engine, also wedged into rock.\n\"We had a total destruction of the aircraft,\" Liotta said.\nTwo farmers hunting for wild herbs found the crash site and alerted officials. They will receive 50,000 yuan ($6,000) each as a reward from the state, local authorities said.\nU.S. officials said they had made contact with all 10 families of the crewmen aboard the plane.\nThey also said the site appeared to have been untouched for more than half a century.\n\"It's no wonder it took 50 years to discover the site,\" said David Rankin, a forensic anthropologist with the Defence Department's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.\n\"We are truly talking about an extremely remote, isolated area.\"", "A leading lawmaker said on Monday that Colombia would continue to be a \"paradise for drug traffickers\" unless Congress voted to overturn a 5-year-old ban on the extradition of drug lords and other criminals wanted abroad.\n\"If we don't end the culture of impunity in Colombia then we have no right to ask for international help in the fight against drugs,\" said Senator Luis Guillermo Giraldo.\nGiraldo, a member of the ruling Liberal party but an outspoken opponent of President Ernesto Samper, proposed legislation in August that would reactivate a 1979 extradition treaty with the United States.\nThe legislation faces a key hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday when a 12-member constitutional committee was set to vote on whether it should be submitted to plenary for approval or thrown out altogether.\n\"If we don't restore our (extradition) treaty, Colombia will continue to be a paradise for drug traffickers,\" Giraldo said in a telephone interview with Reuters.\nIn the run-up to the vote in the Senate, graffiti has appeared in Cali, home to the criminal syndicate that has dominated the world's cocaine trade, threatening those who support sending Colombians to stand trial abroad.\nBut growing numbers of legislators appear to be increasingly swayed by the United States' argument that extradition is a vital weapon in the drug war. Moreover, some political analysts believe it may be impossible for Colombia to regain U.S. certification as an ally in the fight against drugs, withdrawn in March, unless extradition is reintroduced.\nSamper, dogged by accusations that he took drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign, said on Friday he thought Giraldo's bill was poorly timed, arguing that priority should be given to a package of tougher penalties for drug crimes currently going through Congress.\nJustice Minister Carlos Medellin has spoken out in favour of renewing extradition, however, and Alfonso Valdivieso, chief prosecutor and a fervent anti-drug crusader, has even called for extradition to be made retroactive -- a proposal unlikely to please those drug traffickers who surrendered to the Colombian authorities in return for lenient treatment.\nWhile politicians, ministers and lawyers argue the merits of the move, more than 60 percent of ordinary Colombians surveyed by RCN radio in September said they opposed extradition.\nPolitical analysts say such opposition reflected a combination of nationalistic pride and fear that renewing extradition could unleash a new campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations like those led by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s.", "French Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon has granted a telecoms operating licence to state-owned railroads group Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) as a further step towards the sector's liberalisation.\nIn a decree published in the Official Journal on Monday, Fillon said he was granting a 15-year licence to SNCF's Telecom Developpement unit to offer telecommunications services in an alternative to the France Telecom network.\nSNCF still has to detail what assets it is going to put in the Telecom Development unit and also needs to get vetting for its tariffs. The operating licence sets technical standards, privacy issues and interconnection obligations.\nThe SNCF licence is the second such licence for a so-called \"alternative infrastructure\" in France. The first, for Eurotunnel unit TransManche to offer telecom links between London and Paris, was granted late last month.\nA spokesman for the ministry said that \"in the next few days\" licences would be granted to MFS Communication Co of the U.S. and Colt Telecom Group of Britain, owned by financial group Fidelity Investments.\nMFS and Colt will specialise on business networks in highly-populated areas but the SNCF licence covers the railroads' existing network of 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre all over the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years, SNCF sources said.\nThe licence also allows Telecom Developpement to use other means beyond its own network.\nSNCF aims to decide before the end of the year which company will operate the network. It has at least three offers from interested companies.\nOne is from CEGETEL, the Generale des Eaux unit in which British Telecommunications Plc and Mannesmann of Germany have a stake and which aims to become France's second biggest operator. It already runs the SFR mobile network.\nAnother is Bouygues which teamed up with Italy's STET for the SNCF offer and is also talking with Germany's VEBA.\nA third offer is by the Unisource consortium of Dutch KPN, Telia AB of Sweden, Swiss Telecom PTT and Spain's Telefonica.\nAT&T of the U.S. is keeping silent about its intentions but the operator, aiming to play an important role in France, is rumoured to be playing several cards at the same time -- industry sources said it bid both with its usual European ally Unisource as well as on its own account and there are also rumours it is in talks with Bouygues.\nBouygues and AT&T had no comment on the rumours.\nSNCF declined to name the bidders and said it had recently asked them for more details on their bids before taking a decision.\nThe SNCF network could be a vital part in any operator's plans, cutting the time to set up a network in time for the 1998 start of competition as well as reducing investment needs.\nTelecom Developpement, like any future rival to France Telecom, will have to contribute to the costs of running the public service of telecommunications which will remain assured by the national operator.\nA first tranche of 20 percent in France Telecom is expected to be floated on the share market this spring.", "China is not expected to be in the international market for sugar before mid-1997 as stocks are high and domestic prices are recovering in the lead up to the harvest, traders and Western industry sources said on Wednesday.\nBut a lack of cash among state-run sugar processors could affect farmers' willingness to keep growing sugar cane and pressure the industry in the long-term, they said.\nChina had up to two million tonnes of processed sugar in reserve after massive imports in 1995 that have yet to be fully absorbed, a Hong Kong trader said.  \n\"No one knows the actual figure because it's a state secret,\" he said of China's sugar reserves.\n\"I would think there is something between one and two million tonnes, because they imported 3.3 million tonnes in 1995 and it takes a long time to use up,\" he said.\nChina's sugar demand had not increased by very much over the eight million tonnes of recent years, traders said.\n\"China's economy in 1996 has not been that good, so consumption has not really gone up,\" another Asian trader said.\n\"Sugar is not an essential item in China and people can go without it when money is tight,\" he said.  \nThe bulk of the Chinese market is industrial, traders said.\nCentral authorities are expected to maintain tight control over the sugar industry, encouraged by the success of an ongoing crackdown on smuggling, traders said.\nMillions of tonnes of sugar were smuggled into China in 1994 and 1995 on false or altered import licences, flooding the market and pushing ex-factory prices below break-even point.\nThe crackdown, which was long and severe, brought some control back to the sugar industry, traders said, and prices are finally starting to move up.\nNo licences had been issued this year, traders said.  \nA tonne of processed sugar in major production areas in the southwest of the country is now fetching 4,100 to 4,200 yuan (US$494-$506), up from 3,800 yuan (US$458) a tonne a few months ago, traders and industry executives said.\nThe head of a Western company with joint venture interests in Guangxi province said this was \"putting a smile on our faces for the first time in months\".\nGovernment-set cane purchasing prices in Guangxi, China's major sugar grower, have not been raised from last season's 250 to 280 yuan ($30-33) a tonne, he said.  \nBut many state-run sugar processors lacked cash to pay farmers for the cane they grew last season, and had either been late in paying or had handed over IOUs instead, he said.\nChina News Service, a semi-official agency in Hong Kong, reported in August the Agricultural Bank of China's Guangxi branch had been ordered to lend 400 million yuan ($48 million) to the province's sugar industry to buy 100,000 tonnes of sugar.\nMany farmers had already planted cane for the current season when the cash shortages began to bite, but they might be discouraged from planting again if the same happens this year, the Western industry source said.  \nChina's sugar harvest begins in mid-November and according to the official Xinhua News Agency could climb two million tonnes over 1995's 5.65 million tonnes.\nCustoms figures released in late September show China's sugar exports in the first eight months of 1996 were up 310.1 percent on the same year-ago period to 462,459 tonnes.\nImports fell 54.9 percent in that time to 830,000 tonnes, the figures show.\nChina permits raw sugar imports for the purpose of tolling, or processing and re-exporting.\n(US$1 = 8.3 yuan)", "Boeing Co defense and space group President Gerald King said the company's planned acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business was on track to close in early December.\nIn an interview, King also said he expected the defense and space group to remain \"a significant part of the Boeing Co\" with 30 to 40 percent of the company's total revenues \"over time.\"  \nKing said he expected federal regulators to complete an antitrust review of the planned Rockwell deal early next month. The proposal also needs to be approved by Rockwell shareholders at a meeting set for Dec. 4 and should close within a few days after that, he said.\n\"Something could always happen to the merger to keep it from going through, I suppose, even though it looks like a slam dunk in comparison with some of the other things that have been done in this industry,\" King said.  \nLast year defense and space revenues of $5.58 billion were 29 percent of the company's $19.52 billion in revenues, with commercial aircraft sales accounting for the rest.\nThis year defense and space revenues are expected to be nearly flat, while overall company revenues rise to about $22.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial jet deliveries, said analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie.\nThe Rockwell acquisition will add about $2.6 billion in revenue to the defense and space group next year, and King said the company has no immediate plans for further acquisitions.\n\"We're looking only to make this one work first,\" he said. \"If there's a next step, we'll think about that later.\"\nKing said the defense and space group continues to pursue commercial opportunities, including the Sea Launch program, which he said was on track for initial satellite launch in mid-1998.\nKing also said the company and its partner, Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter division, are offering a nine-passenger civilian version of their V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft that will be available in 2001.", "Strong demand for light trucks and relatively few production headaches boosted the combined profits of the Big Three U.S. automakers to nearly $2 billion in the third quarter, exceeding year-ago results by a healthy margin, analysts said.\nThe third quarter is traditionally the industry's weakest, with summer vacations and model changeovers, but strong minivan and truck output helped buoy profits at Chrysler Corp and Ford Motor Co, they said.  \nGeneral Motors Corp operating earnings were held back by a significant increase in U.S. incentives, analysts said.\nIn the third quarter of 1995 the three automakers earned a combined total of $1.35 billion.\n\"It'll be a good quarter overall for the Big Three,\" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Kenneth Blaschke. \"The issue that remains is how long the strike in Canada against GM will last.\"\nGM is expected to report third quarter net income of about $850 million, or $1.02 a share, according to First Call.  \nThe results will include an after-tax gain of $250 million, or $0.33 a share, from the reversal of GM's decision to close its Wilmington, Del., plant and build a new Saturn model there at the end of the decade.\nIn the year-ago third quarter GM earned $642 million, or $0.42 a share, including $246 million in earnings from Electronic Data Systems Corp, the computer services unit spun off by GM in June.\nBurnham Securities analyst David Healy said GM's worldwide car and truck production rose 11 percent in the third quarter over a year ago.  \nBut a heavier mix of less-expensive vehicles and a $230 increase in incentives per vehicle squeezed GM profit margins, which likely resulted in a small pretax loss in North America during the period, he said.\nGM is to report third quarter results on October 15.\nOn an operating basis, Ford's third quarter profits are expected to increase 78 percent, to $637 million, or $0.51 a share, from $357 million, or $0.28, a year earlier, marking the biggest rebound of the Big Three. Ford results are due October 16.  \nThe strength at Ford largely rides on the fact that it is not paying the enormous product launch costs for the Taurus sedan and F-Series pickup truck that dragged down year-ago results.\nFord also is beginning to reap profits from the F-Series and the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which have brightened the automaker's outlook.\n\"We think Ford's new products will enable it to gain an increased share going forward, and as a result Ford's earnings momentum should continue,\" Blaschke said.  \nFord's profits would have been even better but for losses in Brazil and Argentina that the automaker warned about in September.\nFord is scambling to put its Fiesta small car into production in Brazil following the breakup of the company's Autolatina joint venture with Volkswagen AG in 1995.\nChrysler's third quarter profits, scheduled for release October 14, are expected to increase 41 percent, to about $500 million, or $0.69 a share, from $354 million, or $0.48, a year earlier.\nChrysler also experienced launch problems in the year-ago period in its all-important minivan product lines.\nThis year, it is churning out minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks and has raised its share of the U.S. vehicle market to record levels. The launch glitches have not returned, and the company's new Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck is proceeding ahead of schedule, analysts said.\n\"Chrysler has everthing going for it right now and it should be reflected in the earnings,\" said Bear Stearns & Co analyst Nicholas Lobocarro.\nHe said he would not be surprised if the automaker's results exceeded Wall Street estimates.", "Political pressures ahead of a general election may mean the latest bids in a wave of takeovers of British regional electricity companies (Recs) do not get a rapid nod from the UK government, analysts said on Wednesday.\n\"A referral (to competition authorities) is a distinct possibility. I think it is a 50-50 shot,\" said Gordon Culfeather, utilities analyst at Greig Middleton.\nSeven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs have now been sold in a flurry of takeovers since they came up for grabs last March after the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.\nThree of those have been sold to U.S. utilities, who see the UK sector as an opportunity to expand outside U.S. regulatory shackles, particularly into a market which is scheduled to be liberalised to supply competition in 1998.\nThe latest bid is from  U.S. energy group Dominion Resources which agreed to pay 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) on Wednesday to take control of East Midlands Electricity, one of only five remaining independent Recs, in an a offer at 670 pence per share.\nNorthern Electric faces its second hostile approach in less than two years as it battles to throw off a 630 pence per share bid from CE Electric, a unit of U.S.-based CalEnergy, which has already snapped up 29 percent of its target.\nOnly two bids have so far been blocked by trade secretary Ian Lang, who stunned the market by stopping generators National Power and PowerGen from consuming two Recs earlier this year.\nAnother two Recs fell prey to their regional water and sewerage companies, while industrial conglomerate Hanson picked up Eastern Electricity, which it now aims to spin off as part of a separate business under its demerger plans.\nThe remaining victim was Manweb, which succumbed to Scottish Power, an aggressively expansive electricity generator and distributor based in Scotland.\nDominion and East Midlands said they saw no reason for their deal to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), adding that a meeting was scheduled with industry watchdog Offer, which initially consults on bids.\n\"If Lang was following a consistent route, he would not stop these latest bids,\" said one analyst who asked not to be named.\n\"But if I were a regulator, I would probably want at least five firms to make comparisons,\" he added.\nOffer head Stephen Littlechild will send his advice on both bids to Lang for the trade secretary to decide whether they should be referred to the MMC.\nAnother pressure on Lang is the prospect of a general election, which must be held by May 1997, with the opposition Labour party running ahead in opinion polls and allegations of sleaze miring the current Conservative government.\nIts privatisations, which have seen most of Britain's strategic industries sold off, have been heavily criticised for huge executive pay packets, hefty shareholder payouts and heady takeovers which value firms well above privatisation levels.\nLabour, which has vowed to levy a \"windfall\" tax on privatised utilities, said in an opening salvo on the latest bids that it planned \"tough, efficient regulation wherever necessary in the privatised utilities and we intend to see it enforced whoever is the owner.\"\nLang could chose to refer the bids to the MMC in order to delay any decision on this hot political issue beyond an election, some analysts said.\nThe market on Wednesday showed its concerns by capping share prices at well below the bid levels, with Northern trading at 592 pence per share by 1450 GMT and East Midlands at 623 pence.", "- The chief financial officer of debt-ridden Rogers Communications Inc., resigned suddenly Monday.\nGraham Savage, well-respected by analysts and considered a restraining force on flamboyant president Ted Rogers, had been with the firm for 21 years. He resigned to \"pursue other interests,\" the company said.\n\"Of all the senior individuals who have left Rogers in recent times, the departure of Savage is the most detrimental to the company, given Savage is the man who has held it all together for the past few years,\" said Lawrence and Co. analyst Andrew McCreath.\nAnalyst John Drolet at Toronto's Yorkton Securities said, \"This is not good for Rogers at all. I wouldn't be surprised if other people left.\"\nRogers, which also owns Rogers Cantel, a wireless communications firm, has shed U.S. and Canadian assets in the past year in an attempt to cut its debts. Rogers piled up most of its debt load when it acquired Maclean Hunter Ltd., along with the Toronto Sun group, for C$3.1 billion ($2.26 billion).\nTotal long-term debt grew to C$4.88 billion ($3.56 billion) as of June 30 from a year-earlier C$4.07 billion ($2.97 billion).\nIn 1995, Rogers had revenue of C$2.69 billion ($1.96 billion).\n\"Graham Savage was a pretty good guy.

China has yet to take a clear stance on the four-way talks.\nFrosty relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have been in crisis since last month, when 26 North Koreans landed in the South from a stranded submarine.\nDiplomats said Lord's talks did not focus on any single issue, and a major aim of his trip was to prepare for a visit next month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.\n\"Generally speaking relations are on the upturn,\" said one diplomat.

The phone company studies found that Internet usage threatened to overwhelm the system.  \n\"The Internet is not crashing the telephone network,\" Information Technology Association of America President Harris Miller said at a news conference here.\n\"We are bringing the real facts to bear on a'problem' that the phone companies have anecdotally created to protect their own interests,\" said Miller, whose group is a member of the Internet Access Coalition.\nOn December 24, the Federal Communications Commission said it had tentatively decided not to impose access fees on Internet providers similiar to those paid by long distance companies to local phone companies.  \nBut the commission also asked for comments about the effect of the Internet on the phone system.\n\"Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network'congestion' resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a'meltdown' are greatly exaggerated,\" said Lee Selwyn, one of the study's authors.\nFurther, ordinary consumers using the Internet already pay the phone companies more than enough to cover the cost of increased use, said Selwyn, who is an expert on telecommunications regulation.  \nThe study found, for example, that in 1995 consumers paid more than $1.4 billion for installation and use of six million second phone lines devoted to accessing the Internet or other online services. The study said another eight million second lines were not primarily used for Internet access.\nLocal phone companies, some of which had not yet seen the new study, disputed Selwyn's conclusions.\"To suggest that there is no real problem here is mind-boggling,\" Bell Atlantic spokesman Harry Mitchell said. As Internet companies add huge numbers of phone lines to meet growing demand, \"it does impact the capacity of the public telephone network.\"  \nAmerica Online, for example, said recently it would double the number of modems it has to connect with subscribers from 200,000 to 400,000 by June.\nBut phone company studies considered only a few pieces of the phone system, focusing on switches between Internet service providers and the rest of the network, Selwyn said. While those few switches might be congested, capacity could be added inexpensively, he said.\nThe study also cited speeches by some phone company executives who have bragged about the additional revenues generated by increased Internet usage.  \n\"Sales of secondary lines at Bell Atlantic increased more than 50 percent, fueled by surging demand for Internet and telecommuting applications,\" company CEO Raymond Smith told Wall Street analysts last March. The revenue generated substantial profit because \"we were able to provision new lines and services from idle capacity in an existing plant.\"\nCompany spokesman Mitchell said charges from second lines \"were not designed to subsidize Internet service providers.\"\nHowever, all sides agree that a technological solution could eliminate most congestion problems by separating calls carrying voice and data.\nSBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, announced last week it would introduce such splitting technology at a cost of less than $100 million.\n\"Technological solutions are readily available,\" Paul Misener, chairman of the Internet coalition's steering committee said.", "The world's biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.\nThe group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26-percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.\nRTZ-CRA, a dual-listed merger of British-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, is due to announce its earnings on Thursday. It made US$1.441 billion in 1995.\nAustralian analysts' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.\nThe culprits behind RTZ-CRA's profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo trading scandal erupted in June, a weak aluminium price and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter.\nTogether, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA's total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.\nBut metal prices caught a cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal sent international copper prices crashing.\nYasuo Hamanaka, a star trader who once dominated the copper market, has admitted charges of fraud and forgery and accepted blame for a scandal that cost Sumitomo $2.6 billion and devalued the copper inventories of metals companies around the world.\n\"Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing,\" said Peter O'Connor of Macquarie Bank.\n\"Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there's been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time.\"\nRTZ-CRA's iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.\nAdding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.\nRTZ-CRA's coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices. One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.\nRTZ-CRA's troubled Bingham Canyon smelter in Utah has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation.

Stonecipher would not comment on any specific mergers or acquisitions.\n\"I don't think Boeing would be on our radar screen,\" he said regarding a possible acquisition. \"We may be on theirs.\"\nStonecipher also said he would be interested in trading McDonnell Douglas commercial aircraft assets for Boeing's military aircraft business, but noted there have been no talks in that area.

Boeing rose $1.50 to $93.25 and Lockheed Martin rose $1.875 to $95.625, also on the NYSE.\nJohn Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the decision could force St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to seek acquisitions more aggressively to help build its business, or into a merger with another defence or aerospace company.\n\"Everything's back on the table,\" Modzelewski said.\nIn the past year, McDonnell Douglas has been the subject of rumoured talks with Boeing, Rockwell International Corp. and Raytheon Co.\n\"This will be something of a wakeup call,\" CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said. \"It's a fairly sharp and dramatic blow to McDonnell Douglas and I would venture to guess one they probably didn't see coming.\"\nPaineWebber's Modzelewski said, \"Without having the internal growth such as joint strike fighter would give them, they're going to have to grow through acquisition.\" That could include Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business, which is for sale, according to published reports.\n\"Texas Instruments is a very interesting property if in fact it is for sale,\" Stonecipher said in repsonse to a question about the defence electronics business.\nIn a statement to employees Monday, Stonecipher noted the company's backlog of aircraft orders to the military at home and abroad and said it was pursuing other orders. The company has a $46 billion order backlog, a spokesman said.\n\"This decision does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business,\" Stonecipher said.\nMcDonnell currently builds the Air Force F-15 fighter and the Navy-Marine F-18E/F as well as the C-17 military cargo plane.

A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.\nCNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.\nThe copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996. \"They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it,\" a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.\nTraders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.\nIn March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.\nBut when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.\nNot so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: \"Who owns it is anyone's guess.\"\nThe metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.\nThree month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.\n\"It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss,\" a trader said.\n\"Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them,\" the Chinese trader said.\n\"But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage.\"\nA trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would \"dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic\".\nBut the Chinese source said: \"This copper can only be taken by the stockpile\" because no other buyer could afford it.\nChina levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.\nFreight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.\nOther traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.\nAbout 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses.

It's their best short-term ploy.\"\nFlorida is one of 18 states suing U.S. cigarette companies to recoup billions of dollars spent through government healthcare programs on treating people made ill by smoking.  A trial in the Florida lawsuit filed by Butterworth is set for August 4.  \nPhilip Morris Cos Inc and other cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, earlier dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the State of Florida.  The state is seeking to recoup $1 billion or more for treating Medicaid costs from 1994.\nPhilip Morris Cos Inc lawyer Gregory Little said in a news release that the industry's decision had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.  \nLittle said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state's lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during a public, pre-trial hearing.  Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.\n\"The lawyers for the state of Florida have demonstrated a remarkable propensity for trying their case in the media,\" Little said.\nHe accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters.  \n\"....

Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in their anti-tobacco lawsuits.\n\"It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science.... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,\" Butterworth said.\n\"This is a 100 percent victory for the state,\" he said of the industry's decision.\n\"The only downside is that disclosure of the documents is delayed.\"\nA trial in the lawsuit is scheduled to begin on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida.", "First Chicago NBD Corp chief executive Verne Istock expects to see more job cuts at the corporate banking unit as the bank tries to turn around a business that has far underperformed the rest of the company.\n\"I suspect as part of our restructuring of the corporate bank there'll probably be reduced head count in the corporate bank, and there will be reduced capital allocated to the corporate bank,\" Istock said in an interview.\nHe would not say how many jobs would be cut.  \nThe corporate banking unit posted a dismal return on equity of eight percent in the first nine months of the year, compared with nine percent a year ago, with results this year weighed down by a $12 million trading loss. Overall, the bank reported return on equity of 16.9 percent in the first nine months of 1996.\nNow the corporate and institutional banking unit is being reshaped, paring back business lines to focus on those central to customer relationships.  \n\"I firmly believe that something that's chugging along at eight or nine percent can in fact be improved and we fully expect to get it up to that 15 percent or better return\" on equity, Istock said.\nStockholders and analysts appear to accept Istock's argument that the corporate bank's results can only go up.\n\"You can criticize them, but frankly, it can only improve,\" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruette & Woods. \"I think they're taking a hard look at the businesses they're in in corproate banking.\"  \nIstock stressed that increased revenue will come from the corporate bank by focusing on areas that will grow and cutting unprofitable areas.\nAlready this year, the bank has said it will exit the institutional custody and master trust businesses, two paperwork-intensive lines that would have required major investment to gain significant market share.\nIstock also said the bank was trimming its trading operations, again focusing on instruments customers need.  \n\"I don't think we will have to have the entire (trading) product line or be on the edge of the envelope,\" Istock said. But he added that the types of trading vehicles customers need change.\nIstock said he was aware of the corporate bank's troubled performance before First Chicago Corp and NBD Bancorp merged a year ago, forming what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States with assets of $106.7 billion.\nMeanwhile, First Chicago's stock hit a post merger high last week, before sliding in a sell off of most bank stocks this week. An aggressive 40 million share stock repurchase plan announced in October has helped boost the stock.\nBut another area of concern to analysts is credit card chargeoffs, which jumped earlier this year.\nIstock said while chargeoffs will likely rise more as the economy slows, the business will continue to be a strong earner for First Chicago.\n\"It's a business we know, we understand and we plan to stay in,\" Istock said. He added that the bank is beginning to use its 13-million-customer credit card database to sell other products to credit card holders.\nFirst Chicago shares were up 1/8 at 55 Friday.", "Some Chinese traders are moving to take advantage of a sharp rally in world copper prices by selling the red metal back to the market, Far East metal industry sources said on Wednesday.\nA rise in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore was attributed in part by some trading sources to Chinese selling.\n\"With such high LME prices, I believe some (copper) will be brought out of China,\" a Singapore trader said.  \nHe said stocks in Singapore rose 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes late last week -- after hovering at extremely low levels for the past couple of months -- as Chinese buyers sold material recently taken from LME warehouses elsewhere.\nAsian traders have said China is adding substantial tonnages -- up to 300,000 tonnes -- to its central stockpile, with a third of that amount now passing through customs in Shanghai.\nThese reports have helped fuel a rally in three-month LME copper, which has climbed almost 20 percent in recent weeks on tight physical supply.  \nThree-month LME metal hit a five-month high of $2,232 a tonne on Tuesday, up from $1,900 at the end of October.\nWhether or not the copper now in China has completed customs formalities is not an issue, sources said.\n\"This is the government, they do what they like,\" said one.\nThere was a feeling, however, that Chinese government departments, mired in bureaucratic red tape, would be unable to move fast enough to take advantage of rapid market movements.\nThis would be the province of minor trading companies using hot money to buy small lots for speculative purposes.  \nAt least one Asian trader reported small parcel offerings from Chinese companies wanting to pick up between $200-$300 a tonne in profit.\nPrices are at their highest since June 14 when Japan's Sumitomo Corp announced that one of its copper traders had wracked up losses in unauthorised deals now said by the company to be US$2.6 billion.\nReports from Europe last week of a hidden hoard of 600,000 tonnes of copper in Rotterdam were shot down by Asian traders.  \nTight global supply is now driving prices, with LME copper stocks below 100,000 tonnes for the first time since 1990 and representing less than a month's demand.\nTraders in the Far East, polled in recent days, told Reuters this fundamental shift in the world supply/demand picture should keep prices buoyed at least in the short term.\n\"It's a volatile market and it is impossible to know what is going to happen,\" a South American source said.\n\"Is it going to stay over $1/lb next year? Absolutely, I have no doubt about that. It won't be for a couple of days, I'm talking for maybe a quarter and I think it will then stay there.  \n\"Why? Consumption. Don't forget consumption. It is much more important than people think. The fundamentals really call for a higher price,\" he said.\nShanghai and surrounding areas alone use upwards of 45,000 tonnes of copper a month, a European source in Hong Kong said.\nBut physical copper on the Shanghai Metal Exchange has also been tight as traders there liquidate their positions on the rising LME prices.\n\"Prices have gone up so fast it is a little bit hard to digest,\" a trader in Shanghai said.\n\"It could be beneficial to export,\" she said.  \n\"On the other hand, anyone who wanted to buy could be afraid the price will start to go the other way. It's close to year-end, book-squaring time, so everyone will want to sit back and wait.\"\n($1=8.3 yuan)", "General Motors Corp., facing a rancorous strike by its Canadian workers, Tuesday reported a $1.3 billion third-quarter profit that was boosted by strong automotive results and an unsually low income tax rate.\nThe world's largest automaker said the combined net income of its North American Automotive Operations and its Delphi Automotive Systems parts businesses was $515 million. A year ago, the operations had a combined loss of $93 million, while the parent company posted a profit of $396.7 million.\nIncreased volume and favourable currency exchange rates helped GM to nearly triple its international operations profits to $323 million from $111 million a year ago.\n\"The third quarter results from continuing operations clearly show momentum as we continue to rebuild our strength in North America and grow our business in key international markets throughout the world,\" GM Chairman John Smith said in a statement.\nThe earnings, equal to $1.57 a share, compared with a profit of 39 cents a share from continuing operations. They do not include results from Electronic Data Systems Corp, which GM spun off in June. Revenues climbed to $39.1 billion from $35.3 billion in the 1995 period.\nContributing to profits was $565 million in one-time favourable items. GM recorded a $253 million after-tax gain from a reduction in the reserve to pay for plant closings, thanks to its decision to use its Wilmington, Del., facility to assemble new Saturn vehicles.\nAlso, GM's effective income tax rate was 2.8 percent, adding another $312 million, as the company took advantage of several tax credits, including a reinstatement of research and experimentation credits for the last half of 1996.\nGM Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh told reporters during a conference call that rate is expected to return to the 27 percent range in the fourth quarter.\nAs it has all year, GM continued to add to its growing cash account in the third period, contributing another $1.5 billion to bring its total cash balance to $14.5 billion at the end of the quarter.\nBecause GM has previously set its cash goal at $13 billion, Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the GM board will return some of that money to shareholders.\n\"I thought it was a pretty decent quarter,\" he said. \"I have a lot more confidence that they are going to raise the dividend and announce a share repurchase programme.\"\nGlantz said the annual dividend could go to $2.00 a share from the current rate of $1.60 at the next board meeting Nov. 4. By the end of 1997, he said GM may have in place a $3 billion share repurchase programme.\nGM's third quarter net profit margin from continuing operations rose to 3.7 percent from 1.3 percent. Smith said that was good news, but noted the company still has a ways to go before it reaches its average annual profit margin goal of 5 percent over an auto business cycle.\n\"We still have our work cut out to improve margin performance,\" he said.\nGM delivered more vehicles worldwide in the third quarter -- 2,085,000 vs. 2,060,000 -- but its global market share slipped to 16.1 percent from 16.9 percent.\nThe company also lost share in the U.S. car and truck market, finishing the quarter with 30.4 percent compared with 32.2 percent. GM delivered 1,182,000 vehicles in the United States during the quarter, down from 1,235,000.\nBut CFO Losh said the overall volume increase represented good news for the company, and was a sign there is demand for the bevy of new models it is launching.\n\"It's volume that drives earnings, not market share, per say,\" he said.\nAnother positive sign was the pace of new-model launches, said Losh. Production of full-size vans at Wentzvile, Mo., and Saturn coupes in Spring Hill, Tenn., have reached full line speed, and other plants are on schedule.\nGM is in the midst of launching 15 new cars and trucks. In the third quarter, the company had nine plants actively involved in changeovers. Losh said that is the most it expects to have in a given quarter, adding GM will have seven in changeovers in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, one of those nine plants is a facility in Oshawa, Ontario, which is the target of a strike by Canadian Auto Workers. Losh declined to say how much the strike will set back the new model launch there.\nLosh also declined to comment on status of talks between both the CAW and United Auto Workers. About 26,000 CAW members began walking off the job Oct. 3 over the issue of outsourcing -- the use of outside contractors. GM also has yet to reach a new labour pact with the UAW.\nOn Tuesday, the number of U.S. workers idled by the strike rose to 10,297 from 5,911 on Monday.", "Toronto stocks posted their 51st record close of 1996 on Monday, powered by a rally in interest-sensitive issues ahead of an expected cut in Canadian interest rates, analysts said.\n\"(The) market is looking for yet another Bank of Canada cut,\" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.\nCanada's central bank has dropped short-term interest rates 19 times since May 1995, slashing the key bank rate by 4.75 percent to stimulate a lackluster economy.\n\"If there's another Bank of Canada cut, the bank stocks will continue rallying,\" Beattie said.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index gained 17.95 points to close at 5609.26 points, reaching its 51st record close of 1996.\nHowever, the overall market was mixed despite the rally in bank stocks. Declining issues outnumbered advances 478 to 447 with 300 issues unchanged.\nA total of 88.7 million shares were traded worth C$1.28 billion (US$958 million) at Canada's largest stock exchange.\n\"Everybody is still looking at low interest rates and wondering where to put their money. They jump on the bandwagon of recent movements,\" said Ron Meisels, president of P & C Holdings Ltd.\nThe financial services sector extended its long rally, adding more than two percent on Monday. The group led half of Toronto's 14 sub-indices higher.\nOther strong sectors included real estate and utilities. Base metals, conglomerates and communications led the weak side.\nAmong hot stocks, Edper Group Ltd. receipts soared C$7.50 to close at C$78.50 on 4.2 million shares amid market speculation that talks over the World Financial Center in New York would soon conclude, leaving majority shareholders' Bronfman group in clear control.\n* Bank of Montreal jumped C$1.10 to C$42.70, while National Bank of Canada rose C$0.40 to C$13.65.\n* Air Canada shares gained C$0.45 to close at C$5.80 as investors appeared to shun troubled Canadian Airlines Corp. in favor of Canada's largest air carrier.\n* Canadian Airlines fell C$0.36 to C$1.25 today after announcing a four-year C$800 million (US$599 million) restructuring plan on Friday.", "China's Communist leaders may be fretting about the erosion of the ailing state sector at the expense of more nimble private firms.\nBut for one of the nation's newest banks -- the China Minsheng Banking Corporation -- this is an opportunity.\nFormally inaugurated in January, the bank is aiming to lend the bulk of its funds to China's non-state sector, a rapidly expanding area of the economy.\n\"We are focusing our business on the non-state sector,\" chairman Jing Shuping said in an interview. \"Many banks are not looking at this area or are unwilling to lend to it.\"\nMuch of China's creaking state industry is losing money and unable to compete in domestic or export markets. But for now, Communist leaders are unable to shed an ideological albatross, insisting the state retain the leading role in the economy.\n\"The state sector will still play the dominant role but there will be a growing non-state sector,\" said Jing. \"This will be good for the economy and good for us.\"\nChina Minsheng is a non-state entity, founded with the backing of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.\nIt has 59 shareholders, most federation members. Two of the biggest stakes, worth 90 million yuan ($10.8 million) each, are held by diversified Guangzhou Yitong Group and Xiamen Fuxun Group that has interests from real estate to pharmaceuticals.\nThe bank is relatively small by Chinese standards with total capital of 1.38 billion yuan and assets of 5 billion yuan.\nJing says it may not be profitable in its first year due to start-up costs but it aims for a 50 percent return on shareholder capital by the third year of operation.\nBy then, it hopes to have assets of over 10 billion yuan.\nIt differs from many of China's state-run banks that are unable to recover their loans -- made as policy decisions in support of struggling, government-run enterprises.\n\"We have no policy loans,\" said Jing.\nChina Minsheng has extended over 1.0 billion yuan in loans this year -- all on commercial terms.\n\"Most loans are for working capital and not for more than one year,\" he said. \"All have collateral or a guarantee.\"\nThe bank's headquarters are a short walk from the Beijing city government, but Jing said officials do not stroll over to ask for special favours for hard-hit local companies.\n\"They go to the other banks,\" he said. \"The state banks are trying to become commercial banks but they still have to make some policy loans.\"\nBesides its headquarters and an office for international business, China Minsheng has three branches in Beijing. One is in the Haidian district where many high-technology, non-state companies have sprung up -- just the type of customer it wants.\nThe bank cannot lure deposits with higher interest rates since all deposit rates are fixed by the central bank.\nInstead, it must compete in terms of service, staying open longer hours and pumping funds into improving technology by installing computer and automated teller equipment.\nIt has some flexibility on the interest it charges borrowers, though, with a range of 10 percent above or below levels set by the central bank.\nIn the future, China Minsheng will face more competition from foreign banks -- now barred from taking deposits or making loans in Chinese currency.\n\"At the moment, they cannot do local currency business,\" said Jing. \"But that will change.\"\nThe bank is already looking at new areas of business, such as home mortgages, to meet expected demand as China develops a real estate market.\nIt may also want to tap domestic or foreign capital markets to ensure it has the financial muscle to stay competitive.\n\"There could be a movement in this direction in the future,\" Jing said. \"But first we need a good performance over the next three years.\"\n($1 = 8.3 yuan)", "Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.\nEarly results showed candidates of Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) ahead in the few constituencies declared so far but without the majority of the vote needed to win outright, meaning they will face the runner-up in a second round.\nForeign Minister Josef Zieleniec, an ODS vice chairman, welcomed the results but warned supporters against overconfidence. \"I'm very happy that several of our candidates have moved into the next round,\" he told reporters.\nBut he added: \"I warn you, add up all the votes for all of the candidates and think how they will go in the second round. The situation is not as rosy as it may appear from the numbers of ODS candidates that are moving into the next round.\"\nWith three of the 81 constitunecies officially declared, the striking statistic was the turnout figure which ranged from 26.36 percent in the northern mining town of Most to 29.78 in one constituency in the industrial city of Ostrava.\nOne official of the Central Electoral Commission, Ales Kaspar, forecast that turnout nationwide would be by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. \"According to optimistic expectations, the turnout could be between 30 and 40 percent,\" he told Reuters.\nThis suggested the real winners might not be ODS or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate polls and told Czechs to follow suit.\nOpposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.\n\"I would like to remind all voters who criticise our country that by not voting they do not have the right to criticise the government. They have only the right to criticise themselves,\" said Zeman, who is speaker of the lower house.\nBut he added: \"I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates,\" he said.\nShare dealers welcomed signs that ODS, which has led free-market reform in recent years, would do well.\n\"The early results appear pleasantly good for ODS. To me, if these continue, it could be a good result for the market,\" said Jan Sykora of Prgaue brokerage Wood and Co.\nPundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.\nBut the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.\nSladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. \"They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,\" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it \"would be lazy, useless and expensive\".\nOne complaint among voters was that many of the Senate candidates were unknown as government and opposition leaders all sit in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Few Czechs have much idea of what the Senate will do.\nConventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.\nBut Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI), said these theories may not be valid.\nODS is better at mobilising its supporters than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.\n\"If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,\" he said.", "While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labor costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.\nNearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company's top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.\nThat sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labor contract with the United Auto Workers union.\n\"They can't make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour,\" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.\nAdds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: \"Their 43 other competitors aren't going to say'We'll spot you a couple of years.'\"\nTimothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.\n\"Do we do that because we're mean?\" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. \"No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.\"\nFacing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.\nIn the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.\nEven if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.\nAbout 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.\nDelphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.\nBut as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.\nThe worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labor-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour. Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.\n\"If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,\" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.\nITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.\nThe company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.", "MCI Communications Corp is ducking the trench warfare in the consumer long distance telephone market by quietly using data warehousing  to target key customers who are unlikely to flee to the enemy.\nMCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said these customers are looking for advanced services, preferably in a package, but have hitherto been hard to pinpoint.\n\"It has taken tens of millions of dollars and many years to develop profiles of customers who can be targeted in our marketing,\" Maine told Reuters in an interview.  \nData warehousing requires powerful computers to assemble profiles of users from thousands of individual spending decisions and was a technique first applied by retailers.\n\"I always tell investors it is a hidden asset you cannot put a value on,\" Main said.\nSales people use these profiles to sell new services to existing customers, or target those of rivals who are likely to move across for the right services -- and stay.\n\"We've done this for some time in the business sales force,\" Maine said.  \nThe main enemy is churn, the tendency for some customers to switch between providers, which wastes all the marketing, promotional and administrative money spent recruiting them.\nThird quarter results on Tuesday from MCI showed the benefits in the business and data markets that account for two-thirds of MCI's total revenues, but it is early days to see much improvement in the consumer market.\nMCI said churn was higher than a year ago in the consumer market, but lower than in the second quarter.  \nWhile AT&T Corp slugs it out with tiny but tenacious resellers in a costly battle for customers using millions of dollars in promotional ammunition, MCI has cut its promotional spending for customer sign-ons by 70 percent from a year ago.\nMaine said MCI One, a service package on one bill, has no sign-on bonus but half of new users take the Internet service. MCI One users are five times as likely to take cellular and calling cards than when services are billed separately.  \nIt is not just a land war. MCI has cross promotions with Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc, seeing overlaps between frequent fliers and heavy users of calling cards and wireless services.\nOffering free air miles is much cheaper than offering cash, but just as alluring to certain markets.\n\"Our line-up gives us access to 70 percent of frequent fliers,\" said Maine.\nMaine said that AT&T and Sprint Corp have been mining their databanks too, and the whole industry will have a headstart against the regional Bells, which are much newer to the game, when markets are all open to competition.\nDespite all its data warehousing, MCI still makes errors.\nMCI said it is in the process of revamping its paging services, which resell the networks of Paging Network Inc and Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp after it discovered heavy churn.", "British banks have a made a positive start to 1997.\nShare prices are buoyant and analysts on Thursday saw few serious clouds on the horizon to jolt the sector out of its seemingly inexorable rise.\nThe sctor, which has outperformed the FTSE 100 index by around 20 percent over the past six months, has become more diverse in recent years.\nBut, for differing reasons, analysts are quietly confident that based on a benign economic environment, the banks should continue to show good profit growth.\nThere are also positive stories to be told on an individual basis with Barclays and National Westminster, for example, expected to offer further share buybacks and HSBC and Standard Chartered set to continue reaping the benefits of their strong Far East franchise.\n\"The Far East is still looking attractive and we still have Standard Chartered on an outperform rating,\" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. \"We also like Natwest, it's the cheapest stock in the sector, and looks likely to emerge with a more compelling story in 1997,\"\nAnalysts expect NatWest to consolidate its recent heavy acquisition programme and spend possibly 300 million pounds on buying back shares as its Tier One capital ratio measure rises. Barclays is also expected to continue repurchases on which it has already spent around one billion pounds.\nLloyds TSB could also eventually join the share buy-back club as its capital ratios improve, though most analysts do not see this happening before 1998.\nSalomon Brothers banking analyst John Leonard said he expects the British economic outlook to remain favourable.\nThe strength of sterling, while affecting those banks that report dollar income in sterling, looks set to keep the lid on inflation and interest rates, a scenario the banks should be able to deal with.\nIf rates were to rise more than expected then that could be a problem for bank share prices if the market thought bad debt provisions were set to rise.\nOn the other hand, many analysts are not convinced by the link between interest rates and bank share prices.\n\"It's sometimes dificult to tell what causes prices to fall from the outside,\" said one analyst who declined to be named. \"Bank shares have done very well in recent years and operators may well take profits on any (market) setback to lock them away. But that doesn't mean they have changed their view.\"\nOn domestic banking, analysts are happy that banks have been moving more into higher-margin personal sector borrowing at the expense of the lower margins seen in the corporate sector.\nBut they are less happy about the competitive mortgage market which, despite an upturn, is hardly setting the world alight.\nWhile bad debts remain stable, net bad debt charges could rise as releases of old provisions work their way out of the system.\nOther share markets could also have an influence, analysts say.\nSome investors compare the British and U.S. bank sectors and last year, the U.S. rather lost out. If this were to turn, then the British banks could come under some pressure, said Salomon's Leonard.\nBut analysts are already a little nervous given that the banks' good run has continued with such strength.\n\"Some stocks are definitely looking less compelling given the rush of blood we've seen in the New Year,\" said one.", "Overseas subsidiaries of Japan's top brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, virtually doubled their combined profits in the half year to September, energised by strong earnings in Europe.\nAn official of Nomura told Reuters its 66 subsidiaries abroad made a total of 17.7 billion yen ($158 million) in pre-tax profit in the six months, the first half of Japan's fiscal year, almost double the approximately nine billion yen ($80.36 million) in the same period a year earlier.\nThe main reason was a more than five-fold profit surge at Nomura's European subsidiaries, while results in the Asian and American regions were generally flat, the official said in a telephone interview.\nNomura released its half-year parent and group earnings results on Tuesday but did not give details of earnings in the regions.  Despite the buoyant business overseas, the brokerage tipped into the red on a parent and a group net basis after deciding to put large sums of money into helping an ailing financial affiliate.\nIn the business year that ended on March 31, 1996, pre-tax profits at Nomura's consolidated subsidiaries overseas totalled 47.1 billion yen ($420 million).\nIn the April-September period, European subsidiaries led by London-based Nomura International Plc posted current profits of 9.8 billion yen ($87.5 million), more than five times the amount a year earlier, the official said.\nHitoshi Tonomura, a new chairman who arrived at Nomura International in London in the spring of last year, helped to bring operations there back into profit, he said.\nCurrent profits at Asian units were 1.5 billion yen ($13.3 million), slightly up from a year earlier, while those at subsidiaries in the American region totalled 6.4 billion yen ($57.1 million), little changed from a year earlier, he said.\nThe official said successful asset securitisation business by Nomura International fuelled the sharp increase in the profits there, and profits in the United States came largely from the asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities business.\nAs for business in Asia, he said: \"We are still in the stage of investment and not getting returns yet, although we are allocating our human and other resources there.\"\nNomura used to announce its group results about a month after the parent earnings but has brought the group statement forward to provide more timely information for investors.\nIn the first half, it posted parent current profit of 69.87 billion yen ($623 million), while group current profit stood at 74.76 billion yen. However, it posted a hefty half-year net loss on both a parent and consolidated basis after providing financial support of 37.1 billion yen ($331 million) for an ailing non-bank financial affiliate in the Nomura group.\nThe parent net loss was 337.54 billion yen ($3.01 billion) and the group net loss 332.01 billion yen ($2.96 billion).\nCurrent profit is pre-tax, and includes losses and gains on non-operating activities.

Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said of the widely publicized incident involving the House speaker.\nTauzin, who chairs the House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee, has called for hearings into cellular privacy.\nFederal law makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a telephone call, regardeless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone.\nBut experts can cite only a handful of cell-phone cases that have drawn publicity. Politicians have been involved.\nJustice Department spokesman John Russell said that in the case of cellular calls, the law is \"seldom used\" and the department \"seldom\" gets complaints.\nFor one, people rarely know when they have been overheard on their cell phone. And the complicated law is little known.\nIn once case, Sen. Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat, got into hot water in 1991 over an illegal tape recording of a cellular call made by a political rival, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder. Robb was spared indictment. Four associates pleaded guilty in the case.\nAnother case in 1990 centered on an intercepted cell-phone conversation involving then-Rep. Bill Sarpalius, a Democrat from Texas.\nTapes and transcripts of the call -- in which Sarpalius spoke with a young woman about a date and a possible job -- were made available to local media. Two unrelated men were later fined about $250 each in connection with the incident.\nWhy the dearth of legal action?\n\"Violations of this law are very, very hard to detect. That is why there are so few cases,\" said Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of America in Washington.\n\"The person whose privacy is invaded usually never hears about it and so does not alert authorities.\"\nWhat's more, the eavesdroppers usually are not familiar with the people they are monitoring. Penalties generally are light, except in cases involving repeat offenses or use of the information to commit another crime.\nThe only times a case does seem to arise is when the perpetrator tries to capitalize on the conversation.\n\"It doesn't come to light unless somebody makes political or commercial use of the information,\" said Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.\nYet experts agree the law is broken frequently -- possibly hundreds or thousands of times a day -- given the availability and use of scanners that can tune in wireless calls. It's estimated that anywhere from 10 million to 20 million scanners are in use nationwide, many able to eavesdrop on cellular calls.\n\"While the cellular industry may give their customers the illusion of privacy by assuring customers that it is illegal to listen, and that cellular-capable scanners are no longer manufactured or imported into the United States, millions of Americans do listen in,\" according to Bob Grove, publisher of Monitoring Times Magazine.\nLast week, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of a telephone conference call between Gingrich and his top lieutenants. The probe came after a Florida couple said they  delivered a tape of the cellular phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.\nA transcript of the tape was published in two newspapers two days later, prompting Republican calls for an FBI criminal probe into the source of the leak.\n\"You're not going to see the law enforced unless it involves a person of rank, such as a politician,\" said Linus Layne Baker, a Kansas City, Mo. attorney who was fined in the Texas case. \"You won't see the media prosecuted either.\"\nOne option under study in wake of the Gingrich incident is whether to beef up a law that outlaws the sale, manufacture or imporation of scanners capable of picking up cellular calls.", "Intel Corp. President Andrew Grove said the $400 billion personal computer industry must serve up more than just television-like features to impress its most demanding customers: 10-year-old kids.\nIn an opening speech at the Comdex trade show in which he hailed the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor which Intel invented, Grove demonstrated how PCs with his company's next-generation microchips will be able to deliver full-screen video with theater-like, surround-sound stereo.\nBut, he said, this would only bring the PC to parity with the television as an entertainment device.\nThe industry must focus on satisfying \"our most demanding users: 10-year-old kids,\" he said.\nUsing Intel chips and graphics technology from Salt Lake City-based Evans & Southerland Computer Co., Grove demonstrated how graphics could improve by the year 2000 to provide a more lifelike \"flythrough\" down a quiet English village street.\nDemonstrating Intel's renewed emphasis on increasing consumer use of products based on its chips and technologies, Grove said the entire industry needs to focus on satisfying customers with aggressive output of new products.\n\"My fear is that some day that (product) cycle might sputter,\" he told reporters after his address. The industry should aim to grow by 15 percent to 17 percent a year, as it has for the last decade or more, he said.\n\"Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today.\"\nThis is particularly important as the cost of building a semiconductor plant has risen dramatically from $3 million in 1973 to $2.5 billion for its latest plant and will reach as much as $10 billion entering the next millennium.\nGrove said the industry must be prepared to meet consumers' expectations, including those formed over a half century during which the television defined visual experience.\n\"We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time,\" he said, arguing that time especially was a \"finite\" commodity and computers needed to compete with TV for consumer share.\nGrove said there are only about one-third as many personal computers as TVs installed worldwide, even though the numbers of PCs sold annually is starting to outpace the number of new televisions sold on a worldwide basis.\n\"In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins,\" he said. \"In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them.\"\nGrove projected that microprocessors could by the year 2011 be capable of holding 1 billion transistors and deliver 100,000 million instructions per second, or MIPS.\nGrove said these advances are possible with current technology. Microprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, which serve as the brains of personal computers.", "Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Tuesday the computer maker's three-year turnaround plan was still on track despite its statement last week that it will report a first-quarter operating loss of as much as $150 million.\nAmelio, speaking to thousands of Macintosh computer enthusiasts at the MacWorld trade show here also called on several star computer industry executives to express their support for the Macintosh.\nIn his much-anticipated keynote speech, Amelio assured Mac customers the company will have a smooth transition as Apple shores up its finances and overhauls the fundamental software of the Macintosh.\n\"We will encounter a few bumps on the way, but I don't want that to shake your confidence,\" Amelio told Macintosh customers and software developers. \"We are sticking to our strategy.\"\nApple has been struggling for the past year to stop huge financial losses, develop new software to make the Mac more modern and increase revenues. Under Apple's three year plan, it aims to stop financial losses in 1996, develop new products in 1997 and increase revenues in 1998.\nSince Amelio became chairman of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company a year ago, he has slashed costs. In December, Apple also agreed to buy NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million to get its help in revamping the fundamental software of the Mac.\nIn order to move developers smoothly from Apple's current operating system to the new system, Apple said it plans to continue to deliver regularly scheduled upgrades to the current system while accelerating development of a new and advanced operating system.\nThe new operating system, code-named \"Rhapsody,\" will be based on the merging of technologies from Apple and NeXT.\n\"Our goal is to be one of the world's strongest brands for consumer, education and the enterprise,\" Apple co-founder and Next Software President Steven Jobs said, adding Apple hoped to rely on Next's multimedia and computing intensive software to accomplish that goal.\nApple said Friday it expected to report a loss from operations of $100 million to $150 million because of weak sales of its Performa line of Macintosh computers. Revenue for the company's first quarter ended Dec. 27 is expected to drop 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter.\nAmelio blamed the shortfall on weak consumer sales for personal computers rather than a breakdown of Apple's strategy.\n\"We had one thing that really fell out of bed in a big way and that is, Santa Claus forgot to come,\" he said, referring to the surprisingly low sales of its Performa desktop PC line aimed at consumers.\nThe first quarter \"was about retail sales, not about the fundamentals in the recovery of Apple,\" Amelio told a packed ballroom.\nIndustry experts say part of the blame for declining revenue falls on the perception that there is not as much software for the Macintosh as there is for PCs running Windows software from Microsoft Corp..\nTo boost the Mac's image, Amelio turned to executives from Microsoft, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. to announce software plans for future versions of the Mac.\n\"We see great opportunities for the Mac in the future,\" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft vice president in charge of application development.\nAt Macworld, Microsoft introduced its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, which has often battled Apple for control of the PC industry, also said it created a new product unit responsible for design and development of a Macintosh version of its widely used Microsoft Office software suite.\nWhile Microsoft remains Apple's great nemesis in the operating systems software business, Microsoft also has long served as the leading independent developer of software applications that run on Apple Macintosh computers.\n\"When Apple's biggest third-party developer decides to commit new resources to its Macintosh applications business, that's a pretty clear sign that there's still money to be made in the Macintosh market,\" said Jeffrey Tarter, an industry analyst and publisher of Soft*Letter.\nThe creation of the new Macintosh product unit, part of the Microsoft desktop applications division, marks the first time in the history of the division that an entire product unit has focused exclusively on the Macintosh, Microsoft said.\nJames Barksdale, chief executives of Internet software vendor Netscape, also said his company will release versions of its communication software within the next few weeks that will run on Apple's next-generation operating system.\nApple's stock closed down 37.5 cents at $17.50 on Nasdaq.", "China warned Taiwan on Wednesday not to seek independence from the communist mainland, hinting the island would meet disaster if Taipei insisted on splitting from the motherland.\nTaipei had failed to answer a 1995 call by Chinese President Jiang Zemin for reconciliation and had instead actively sought to split Taiwan from mainland China, the official Xinhua news agency said.\n\"We urge the Taiwan authorities to rein themselves in at the precipice so that they can see clearly that the status of Taiwan being part of China cannot be changed and that the trend of Taiwan's reunion with the motherland cannot be resisted,\" the agency said in a commentary.\nBeijing, which views Taiwan as a rebel province, refuses to rule out the use of force to recover the island if Taipei declares independence.\nHowever, the tough commentary by China's state news agency held out the possibility of a resumption of quasi-official talks if Taiwan's authorities showed they sincerely wanted the eventual unification they say is their goal.\nThe commentary was issued to mark the second anniversary of a conciliatory speech by Jiang, who urged an end to hostilities between the bitter political rivals and the opening of direct trade links.\nTaiwan officials had shrugged off Jiang's olive branch and were actively working to divide China and further block economic and trade links, Xinhua said.\n\"The Taiwan authorities advocate'splitting the country and ruling under separate regimes' and'two equal political entities', which are in fact aimed at tearing apart China's sovereignty and territory,\" the agency said.\nIt said people gifted with insight and who had at heart the fundamental interests of Taiwan's people should unite and remove obstacles preventing talks.\n\"The Taiwan authorities, under pressure both from within and without, have to respond to the important speech of President Jiang Zemin and at least gesture to make strategic readjustments regarding some questions in the cross-straits relations,\" Xinhua said. It did not specify what adjustments were needed.\nTaiwan has barred direct trade and transport links with the mainland since the two were separated at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taipei has clung to its ban as a last bargaining chip in talks on reunification with Beijing.\nChina's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year is expected to give Beijing more leverage in any talks.\n\"With the return of Hong Kong and that of Macau in 1999, the solution of the Taiwan question and the motherland's reunification will become more prominent issues for all Chinese people,\" Xinhua said.\nAnalysts have said Jiang is eager to bring Taiwan into the mainland's communist fold to etch his name in history alongside the late Chairman Mao Zedong and current paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who negotiated the return of Hong Kong from Britain.\nChina would continue to promote economic exchanges between the two sides while keeping a vigilant watch over any movement toward independence for Taiwan, the Xinhua commentary said.\n\"The fight against separatism and Taiwan independence has illustrated the Chinese people's strong determination and ability...to strike hard against separatist activities and Taiwan-independence forces in Taiwan,\" the agency said.", "Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers.\nGM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning.\n\"The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,\" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. \"GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing.\"\nAnalysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements.\nThe pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants.\nDavid Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency.\n\"GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,\" Cole said. \"The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do.\"\nBut the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs.\nThe plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.\nOn Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.\nThe union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.\nBy the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.\nGM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.\nLast week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.\nGM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.\nHealy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.\nIn contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.\nThe signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.\nYokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.\nYokich told reporters the Chrysler signing \"shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.\"\nMeanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.\nSome analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile.

This is mainly done through the Global One joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States.\nSecondly, the group wants to use its know-how in building modern infrastructure networks and is setting up such networks in Latin America and Indonesia.\nThirdly, the group is looking for \"new growth areas\" to compensate for the impact on sales of the new competition in France, Bon said.\nMobistar, in which France Telecom has a majority stake, is part of this policy. The Beglian operator started six weeks ago and has 20,000 subscribers, aiming for a 25 percent market share in 2005.\nFrance Telecom hopes to hear in November that a consortium it leads has won a GSM licence in Romania and the group is in negotiations with the government of Poland.\nIn Poland, France Telecom is operator of an analogue network but was excluded from getting a GSM digital licence. After a state visit by French President Jacques Chirac, the situation has improved for France Telecom, but negotiations are still continuing.\nIn Italy, France Telecom has no ambitions in mobile telecommunications, because of the presence of state-owned TIM Omnitel, which is run by Olivetti.\nFrance Telecom is talking with Olivetti about co-operating in Infostrada, a fixed-line venture which is bidding for the network of the Italian railways.", "Bidders for a stake in troubled Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody a.s. must offer at least 950 million Czech crowns ($35 million) for the shares, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday.\nBut he told a news conference that the tender, open to domestic and foreign bidders seeking to revitalise the light jet maker, might be geared toward choosing a Czech partner.\nBetween 34 and 40 percent of Aero will be sold, depending on how many new shares are issued during the deal, rules for which the cabinet approved on Wednesday.\nDlouhy said a steering committee would evaluate bids in the tender, which is expected to open by the end of the month, based on bidders' economic strength, obligations to other shareholders and their strategic position.\nThe Czech chemical and arms conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. has shown an interest in Aero, as well as local trading company CIMEX Holding a.s., and Boeing Co of the United States in an alliance with Czech airline Ceske Aerolinie a.s..\nDlouhy said Aero shareholders controlled by the state would pass their shareholders' rights to the new investor to allow it to manage the company from a majority position.\nThe winner of the tender, ultimately picked by the cabinet, should be known in April.\nDlouhy said strategic considerations might persuade the steering committee to pick a Czech domestic partner for Aero.\n\"If, for example, the Defence Ministry submits arguments which persuade the commission that it is necessary.... to prefer a domestic investor, it will be a criterion.... followed by the commission.\n\"But we do not want to consider it open only for domestic companies from the beginning,\" he said.\nShareholders of the debt-strapped company approved a cut in Aero's basic capital last month to one million crowns from 962 million, as part of an overall a financial restructuring plan.

Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., makes about a quarter of its revenue from the sale of its Windows family of operating systems.  Operating systems are the type of software that controls the basic functions of every PC.  \nMicrosoft benefits from strong PC sales because PC makers have to pay Microsoft a royalty for every copy of Windows they pack in the boxes of new machines.\nWall Street expects Microsoft to earn $0.90 a share, according to a survey of 24 analysts by First Call.

Both are taking business from Sybase Inc,  another database software publisher, which is still struggling to recover from marketing and technical shortcomings last year.\nSybase,is expected to report it broke even in the quarter, not counting charges for a restructuring, Pickrel said.  In the year-earlier quarter, Sybase earned $0.01 a share.  \nOracle, the biggest database software publisher, is expected to earn $0.27 a share for the fiscal second quarter ending November, according to a recent survey of 27 analysts by First Call.

There will be no exceptions,\" one source quoted propaganda tsars as saying.\nPropaganda tsars are also debating the fate of the Beijing-based magazine \"Orient\" for publishing a series of book reviews on the \"Collected Works of Gu Zhun\", sources said.\nThe Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party had ordered a gag on all debate on the thoughts of Gu, an independent thinker who angered Beijing before his death during the Cultural Revolution.\nGu openly opposed totalitarianism and supported the rule of law and civil rights.\nThe fifth edition of the magazine was published in September under the watchful eyes of censors, the sources said.\n\"We will still be able to publish the sixth edition.

The stock has risen more than 13 percent since the start of the year.\nIn an update of its product portfolio, Medeva also announced a tie-up with small drug discovery group Peptide Therapeutics Plc which could see painful injections against illnesses such as influenza, typhoid and tetanus replaced by nasal sprays or capsules.\nThe two are also investigating a vaccine against the E-coli bacteria, which has killed 17 people in a recent outbreak in Scotland. Medeva said it spent three million pounds ($4.90 million) taking a 2.5 percent stake in Peptide, whose shares soared nearly 20 percent to 289 pence.\nBut the market's main focus was on prospects for the hepatitis B vaccine, Hepagene, which many analysts see as a huge potential money-spinner. In an interview with Reuters, Medeva chief executive Bill Bogie said Hepagene could eventually sell \"millions of doses\" a year, and carry a three-figure price tag.\nThe vaccine is targeted at a significant group of people who do not respond to existing Hepatitis B vaccines, such as SmithKline Beecham Plc's Engerix-B.\nMedeva sees a large market for it, especially among health workers and police who are routinely protected against the infection.\nStill more exciting is the drug's potential to treat people who are already infected with Hepatitis B, which is 100 times more infectious than HIV and kills two million people a year around the world. Bogie said tests on people who do not respond to the current treatment, Interferon, showed a 38 percent response rate.\nMedeva will decide later this year whether to expand production capacity for Hepagene at its plant in Speke in northwest England or to look elsewhere for extra output.\nA major surprise was Medeva's declaration that it would seek regulatory approval for Hepagene in Europe and the United States in 1998, opening up the prospect of first sales in 1999. Bogie said this was a sign of confidence that Medeva would win outstanding battles over patents on both sides of the Atlantic.\nIt won a key judgement in Britain's House of Lords against U.S. rival Biogen Inc last year. Bogie said Medeva would not be seeking marketing partners for Hepagene beyond its existing agreement with Johnson & Johnson to sell Hepagene in southeast Asia.\n\"We are not looking for a partner. That does not mean they won't happen but we are fairly confident we can do it ourselves,\" he said.\nMedeva, whose executives spent Thursday morning with analysts, also announced plans to go ahead with development of a purified form of its most profitable product, the behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate.\nBogie said the new version of the drug being developed by Chiroscience Group Plc would give Medeva important patent advantages over rivals and cut down the number of times a day Methylphenidate is taken.", "Inco Ltd's huge nickel, copper and cobalt property at Voisey's Bay in remote Labrador keeps getting bigger, with 11 drill rigs working around the clock to define three enormous deposits that promise to upset the world's metals markets.  \n\"There are a couple hundred million tonnes for sure, close to proven,\" said Greg Soper, a drill manager for Archean Resources, which has an exploration contract until the end of the year at the Northern site on a sub-Arctic land mass that is closer to Greenland than to much of the rest of Canada.\n\"This here is a world class deposit. Every week we're hitting stuff,\" said Soper, waving his arm to point at the vast stretch of bog and thin forest surrounding the round, rocky hill where metals were discovered two years ago.  \nInco's most recent calculations, compiled in an internal report at the end of August, showed 138 million tonnes of resource (corrects from \"proven or probable reserves\") spread out over three different deposits at the Voisey's Bay property. Resources are potential reserves.\nOn average, the deposits graded 2.09 percent nickel, 1.24 percent copper and 0.99 percent cobalt, the report said.\nAt the Ovoid deposit, found close to the surface of a bog close to the Labrador Sea, drilling has outlined 37.5 million tonnes. Exploration is finished at the Ovoid and Inco now plans to mine the area through an open pit mine.  \nThe Eastern Deeps, which lies under a series of hills covered with sparse trees and lush moss, has not yet been defined.\nRecent calculations showed 75.5 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit was open in all directions.\nTo the west of the Ovoid, in the Western Extension, drills are uncovering another rich deposit. The mineralization was uncovered last April, after Diamond Fields Resources Inc, the owner of Voisey's Bay, accepted Inco's C$4.3 billion takeover offer.  \nSo far, drilling has defined 24.7 million tonnes, but the deposit is growing steadily.\nBoth the Eastern Deeps and the Western Extension need extremely deep holes to strike significant metal, and each major hole takes about three weeks to drill, said Soper.\nMore than 340 holes have been completed so far, with a total drilling meterage of more than 135,000 metres, Inco said in its recent mine and mill project description.\n\"Over half of our holes are good. They're mineralized,\" said 25-year-old geologist Mary Vaughan as she examined a new box of core samples just brought in from the Eastern Deeps.  \n\"It just blows you away. It's an explorationist's dream.\"\nArchean Resources plans to keep drilling at a breakneck pace until its contract ends in December.\nInco has not said whether it will extend Archean's contract, but the Toronto-based company has promised to spend C$20 million over the next four years on exploration.\nOnly five percent of the property has been explored so far, but small exploration companies that have claims surrounding Inco's 495-square-kilometre site have not found anything significant.  \nNew resource calculations are expected within the next month, Rick Gill, spokesman for Inco subsidiary Voisey's Bay Nickel Co told Reuters in St. John's, Newfoundland.\nMining at Voisey's Bay is expected to last at least 20 years, with a concentrator on site handling 15,000 tonnes of ore a day. Mining will likely continue all year round, despite high winds, extremely cold temperatures and thick ice that locks in the site for a few months every winter.\n\"The information that we have at this time suggests it will be possible to operate year'round with ice breaker support,\" said Gill.", "Russia, dramatically changing its approach to foreign investment in its huge oil sector, said on Monday that new domestic companies, not Western majors, would be given the upper hand in future billion-dollar energy deals.\nVladimir Tumarkin, chief spokesman for Rosneft, the state oil holding company which is being privatised and the state's agent in production-sharing deals, said the days of foreign oil firms winning majority stakes to tap Russian reserves were over.\n\"We have a new approach,\" Tumarkin said. \"We do not wish to repeat the so-called mistakes of earlier deals, when majority stakes went to foreign companies and Russia was left out.\"\nHe told Reuters he was referring to three, high-profile deals with Western and Japanese oil investors off Russia's Far Eastern island of Sakhalin -- deals in which Russian equity and ownership play a relatively minor role.\nAs a test of the new approach to Western oil investors, he said Amoco Corp, Exxon and Texaco of the United States, Total SA of France and Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway -- all bidders in a recent tender to develop reserves in Timan-Pechora -- would be asked to form a consortium and to give at least a 50 percent stake to Russian companies.\nThe companies had bid, some individually, some together, to develop up to 200 million tonnes of crude oil in the Khoreiverskaya Basin in oil-rich northern Timan-Pechora.\n\"The philosophy behind investing in Russian oil has changed,\" Tumarkin said, adding that Rosneft would hold talks with the companies next week.\nForeign oil investors are already wondering about the extent to which Moscow truly wants outside help in developing reserves in Russia, the world's third largest crude oil producer.\nLots of competitive investment dollars have gone to energy-rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, where deals have got off the ground faster and more smoothly.\nBut while Russia has said it wants to turn around its flagging oil sector, where output has declined by 46 percent since the mid-1980s, its newly-privatised oil companies may not be able to carry the banner.\n\"The question is, do the Russian companies have the financing for all this,\" said oil analyst James Bunch at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.\nSome of Russia's vertically-integrated oil companies have the makings of future stars, with savvy management and reserves that put them in the world's big league. But many of them are weighed down by non-payments and corporate taxes that leave them little free cash to invest.\n\"I don't think the size of stakes (in production-sharing contracts) makes that much difference to Western companies -- what is important is the economics of the deal,\" said oil and gas analyst Stuart Amor of CS First Boston in London.\nHe said it was doubtful whether Russian companies could find the money needed in the near-term to work with foreign investors and that crude oil output levels were, as a result, unlikely to rise significantly.\nU.S. energy companies have invested less than $1 billion of the $60 billion they have said they plan to commit to Russian oil deals, complaining of political and legal risk.\nProminent projects -- including the $40 billion international Timan Pechora Company deal, and Amoco's $50 billion plan with Russian oil group YUKOS to tap Priobsk reserves -- are beset by quibbles with the Russians over equity stakes, contributions, and asset valuations.\n\"They're obviously not going to like it,\" said one Western analyst of Russia's new approach. \"But I don't know if it will drive them out.\"", "Millennium Chemicals, to be spun off from the mighty Hanson conglomerate in an October flotation, has already had to rebuff would-be suitors, chief executive of the soon-to-be independent company said on Tuesday.\nWilliam Landuyt, who is also chairman of Millennium, also unveiled his strategic blueprint in an interview with Reuters, including plans for a share buyback by 2000 after cutting debt and implementing post-demerger investment plans.\nMillennium had 1995 sales of two billion pounds ($3.12 billion) and profits of 588 million pounds.\n\"We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company,\" Landuyt said, warning investors of a tight dividend policy.\nThe demerger of Hanson Plc will create four companies - Millennium, Imperial Tobacco, Energy Group and the rump building firm which will retain the famous Hanson name.\nAs investors await details of the float of the first two divisions - Millennium and Imperial - Landuyt said there had been takeover interest in all four companies including his own empire.\n\"We've had interest for every business in Hanson.\" He said \"expressions of interest\" included those for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated off.\nMillennium itself received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. All approaches were rebuffed.\nHanson's chemicals arm had been widely tipped as a takeover candidate by analysts in recent months, but Hanson's group share price recently took a hit after it was revealed that Millennium had built in a \"poison pill\" to deter predators.\nThe move led to a downgrading in the Hanson break-up value by analysts including BZW which pared back to 193 from 207 pence per share. The market valuation range spreads from 150 pence to 200 pence per share. Hanson's shares stand at 162 1/4, up 2 3/4 pence.\nOne analyst said of the poison pill episode \"It was quite disgusting. Here is a predatory company which has spoken out against such tactics and has installed a poison pill itself.\"\nBut Landuyt said it was vital to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.\n\"We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months. We don't want a temporary drop in the share price to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value.\"\nUnder law in the U.S. state of Delaware, a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.\nBut the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid.\nAnother factor which has damped Millennium's core valuation has been poor trading which has dogged the chemicals market leading to plant closures and asset writedowns of $60 million at SCM. Landuyt said that a further $15 million charge still had to be levied.\nHe said the impact on trading profits would be neutral and also said signs of an uptick remain.\nHe expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers.\nQuantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.", "Unisys Corp. posted improved results in the third quarter, the company said Wednesday, as its new business structure began to pay off, while Stratus Computer Inc. reported better-than-expected profits.\nUnisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., reported a third quarter profit of $14.2 million, but a loss of 9 cents a share after paying $30.2 million in dividends on preferred stock. That compared with a net loss of $32.2 million, or 36 cents a share a year ago.\nRevenues for the third quarter were $1.63 billion, up 9 percent from $1.49 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nUnisys said revenues were up at each of its three business units: information services, computer systems and computer services. The three units were formed in a restructuring.\n\"After nine months of operations under the new business structure, our three businesses.... are more cost-competitive, streamlined, and focused on capturing opportunities in their respective markets,\" said James Unruh, chairman and CEO.\nUnisys shares closed at $6.875, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.\nUnisys said its computer systems group has made excellent progress in working through a major product transition to its new lower-cost mainframes, which have experienced a delay as it tested problems with a new chip.\nUnisys said while the transition continued to affect its results, sales of computer systems were up 14 percent and profitability in this unit \"rebounded nicely\" in the quarter.\nAnalysts said a sale of more than 50,000 election systems in Brazil helped its computer systems unit. Revenue increased strongly both in the United States and internationally.\n\"The Brazilian deal was over $50 million,\" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst.\nUnisys said it planned to meet its revised shipment schedule for its new mainframe computers, which are a major transition to a new lower-cost architecture. Analysts said they expected the high-end versions of these systems to begin shipping around March and April.\nSeparately, Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlboro, Mass., reported a better-than-expected third quarter, citing a positive contribution from its once-beleaguered software business and improved sales of its new computers.\nStratus reported third quarter income of $10.8 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.3 million, or 40 cents a share in the third quarter of 1995.\nRevenues totalled $150 million vs. $151 million last year.\nStratus's results were better than Wall Street expectations. According to First Call, the consensus estimate was for third quarter earnings of 42 cents a share. The company's shares closed at $24.25, up 25 cents, on the NYSE.\nStratus said its software business contributed to earnings for the first time this year, as the benefits of its recent restructuring began to take effect.\n\"With a sharpened focus on the best opportunities, we expect that results will continue to improve in this part of our business,\" said Bill Foster, chairman and CEO, in a statement. Stratus restructured its software unit in the second quarter.\nHardware revenues were up 15 percent on a sequential basis and were up 5 percent vs. the year-ago period, as its Continuum Series computer line saw strong sales growth. It expects even stronger Continuum growth in the current quarter.\nJones of Salomon said its new Radio systems, which run Microsoft Corp.'s NT operating system, will also be a contributor when it begins volume shipments this quarter.\nStratus develops so-called fault-tolerant computers specifically designed with a backup system in case of system failures.", "A long-delayed Japanese mission to discuss the details of Tokyo's huge state loans to China has reached basic agreement on 22 development projects proposed by Beijing, Japanese officials said on Thursday.\nProjects involving infrastructure, agriculture and environmental protection were likely to be among the recipients of favourable Japanese loans, said Shiro Sadoshima, director of the loan aid division of Japan's Foreign Ministry.\nFinal decisions had yet to be made on the 22 projects slated to receive the 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) earmarked for the first year of the yen loan package, which will run from 1996 to 2000, Sadoshima told a news briefing.\nJapanese sources in Beijing say discussions on the projects had been long delayed because of faltering relations and Japanese anger at China's nuclear testing that last year led to the freezing of Japanese grant-in-aid.\nThe 580 billion yen in Japanese soft loans due to be extended to China between 1996 to 2000 were not formally affected by the protest, but no missions to approve their details had been sent since China conducted a nuclear test in May 1995.\nAsked if Chinese nuclear testing was a factor in Tokyo's delay in sending the loan mission, Sadoshima said that did not appear to be the case.\n\"At least, our government has never said that,\" he said, adding it was incorrect to say work on the loans had been \"resumed\" -- a word used by other Japanese officials.\n\"It's not a resumption.... We never stopped,\" he said.\nRelations between Beijing and Tokyo have been strained this year by a controversial visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to a shrine to Japan's war dead and by a territorial dispute over an island group in the East China Sea.\nWhile Chinese state media have been quick to condemn what they call resurgent Japanese militarism, diplomats say Beijing is keen not to allow the disputes to harm an economic relationship in which the soft yen loans are an important part.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai earlier this week warned Japan not to use financial assistance as a form of political pressure, saying to do so could only harm ties.\nThe yen loans, widely seen in China as a form of reparation for the suffering inflicted by Japan during World War Two, have themselves been a source of dispute.\nThe rise of the value of the yen in 1994 and 1995 -- which sent the cost of the loans soaring -- prompted howls of Chinese complaints and demands to be allowed to repay in U.S. dollars.\nTokyo refused, but the yen's later decline helped blunt the issue as a potential cause of conflict and both sides have recently shown new willingness to cooperate on other issues.\nPrime Minister Hashimoto has been reported as promising to consider lifting the freeze on grant-in-aid to China, but Sadoshima said that issue would not be discussed by the loan mission.\n\"That's not my department,\" Sadoshima said.\n($1 = 113 yen)", "One of Hong Kong's best-known pro-democracy politicians, Emily Lau, was dragged away kicking and screaming by police after lying down on a road to protest against China's methods of choosing a post-colonial leader.\nUp to 40 pro-democracy activists scuffled with riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where a committee of 400 chosen by Beijing voted for a chief executive to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30.\nA dozen activists shouting \"oppose the phoney election\" lay down on the road and were dragged away by police.\nLau, an independent democrat fiercely critical of China's communist rulers, was among those carried off, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear if they were arrested.\nFellow legislators Andrew Cheng of the Democratic Party and trade union leader Lee Cheuk-yan were also hauled away.\n\"It's a sad day for Hong Kong. What can ordinary Hong Kong citizens do -- they cannot vote,\" John Wing-ling Tse, a legislator of the Democratic Party said.\nEarlier, protesters erected a \"tomb of democracy\" outside the building and condemned the voting as the end of freedom and the rule of law in the territory.\nOnly the 400 electors chosen by China voted for the future leader. None of the rest of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people had a vote.\nSeveral hundred pro-democracy activists demonstrated on Tuesday evening and 20 diehards camped out overnight with the imitation tomb in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\nAs the Selection Committee members arrived in shiny limousines, their first sight was an imitation ancient Chinese-style grey arched tomb, constructed from wood.\nThe structure faced the Hong Kong Convention Centre with the inscription \"Tomb Of Hong Kong Democracy And Rule Of Law\". Candles flickered in the wind beside it.\nThe committee was convened to carry out the first of two historic tasks -- to elect the man who will step into the shoes of Governor Chris Patten when Britain pulls out. The clear favourite was shipping magnate Tung Chee-Hwa.\nThe committee's second task, on December 21, is to choose a provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legco (Legislative Council) on July 1.\nThe scuffles erupted after police urged the demonstrators, from the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, to move to a cordoned-off area.\nOccasionally the group marched a short distance bearing the tomb aloft, as in a funeral procession. In front of the tomb a banner was posted saying \"Death of Hong Kong Rule Of Law\".\n\"We are against the Selection Committee's so-called election of the first chief executive,\" said Cheng. \"The selection is not real because it is done by Beijing,\" the legislator said.\nThe protesters brandished a colourful banner with the slogan \"Oppose the False Election Of The Chief Executive, Oppose The Provisional Legislature\" and denounced China for not allowing Hong Kong's electorate to vote.\n\"This is an abuse of their human rights. Some people are more equal and have more rights. In other cultures it is always your vote that counts.

A weaker yen makes it cheaper for Japanese firms to produce vehicles in Japan and sell them in the United States.\nSince April 1995, when the yen hit a high of 80 to the dollar, the Japanese currency has weakened. The rate is now about 114, meaning it takes more yen to buy one dollar.\nVan Bussman, Chrysler Corp.'s top economist, believes the yen will continue in the 110-115 range for the first three to six months of 1997, then strengthen to about 100.\n\"I think it will be a substantial issue in 1997,\" Bussman said. \"The yen having weakened from 80 to 110 has given them tremendous profit potential in North America.\"\nA look back through 1996 shows that Japanese automakers have already turned the weaker yen to their advantage through lower prices.\nIndustry trade publication Automotive News reported the average 1997 model year price increase at Detroit's Big Three was $386, while the average price hike for Japanese automakers was a mere $8.\n\"It's going to be tough next year because we have the weaker yen,\" Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman said recently.\nForecasts for 1997 project total vehicle sales will be roughly the same as the 15.4 million expected for 1996. But that's not all that bad, industry executives say.\nIt means the four-year upswing of car, sport utilty and pickup truck sales could continue for yet another year.\n\"We see moderate inflation. We see a steady continuation of economic expansion in the United States,\" Trotman said. \"We're looking for the car and truck industry to fall somewhere in the 15 to 15.5 million range for 1997, which we would describe as a pretty good year.\"\nJapanese automakers, which have introduced hot new car and sport utility vehicles this year, are set to unleash more new products in 1997.\nHonda Motor Co.

Building on the momentum of its new Camry sedan, Toyota Motor Corp. will unveil a front-wheel drive minivan called the Sienna next fall.\nAmong the Big Three, 1996 proved to be the year that Chrysler's raft of stylised new products took off, outshining its two domestic rivals. The No. 3 automaker has boosted U.S. market share nearly two points to 16 percent, and its calendar year sales will post their best results since 1988.\nGeneral Motors Corp. will try to reverse a slide in both sales and market share next year as it continues with the introduction of 15 new cars and light trucks, including a new line of minivans.\nGM will also look to improve its overall competitiveness with a new three-year contract with the United Auto Workers that could allow it to shed 30,000 workers. But that deal did not come cheaply. GM endured several strikes through the year that will cost it more than $1.6 billion.\nAt Ford, cost-cutting will remain a top priority next year. The No. 2 automaker has scored big in the market place with its new F-Series pickup trucks and Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.\nBut its car sales have lagged, and Ford has been forced to slap incentives on its redesigned Taurus to push them out of dealer showrooms. Ford, which replaced the head of its core automotive operations in October, will also lose hundreds of millions from European and South American operations in 1996, but sees improvements in those areas for 1997.", "Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp is the most likely contender to partner junior mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd in developing its huge Indonesian gold deposit, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n\"We really only have one potential front runner: Barrick,\" said gold analyst Barry Allan with Gordon Capital.\nBarrick has demonstrated its interest in Indonesian gold by investing more than US$10 million in exploration and amassing a large land position in Indonesia, analysts said.  \nAnd Barrick's association with a construction company run by the daughter of Indonesia's President Suharto suggests Barrick is carefully setting up its network to control a piece or all of the Busang, Bre-X's 47-million-ounce discovery in the middle of the jungles of Borneo.\n\"They're trying to position themselves the best they can,\" said one analyst who did not want to be named.  \nAnalysts who have been closely watching developments around Busang,said Barrick stands the best chance of bidding successfully for a stake in the property because Barrick's own high-priced stock, relative to the value of its assets, will look attractive to Bre-X shareholders.\n\"In order to pay the sort of multiples Bre-X is trading at, you have to have a high gold multiple in order to land the company or the property at these prices,\" said Rick Cohen at Goepel Shields in Vancouver.  \nBre-X shareholders will likely look for a combination of cash and shares so they can keep a stake in the fortunes of Busang, analysts said.\nBre-X is looking for a heavyweight mining company to buy all or part of the Busang discovery and act as operator of what is expected to become one of the world's biggest gold mines. But the search has been dogged by a dispute with Bre-X's Indonesian partners over ownership.\nThe spat has caused the Indonesian government to delay granting Bre-X essential contracts of work needed to develop Busang. Without the contracts, analysts said a bid for Bre-X would be unlikely.  \nBre-X has refused to speak to the media since it forged an alliance with Indonesian President Suharto's son last week. But some analysts said Bre-X told them recently the dispute should be cleared up this month.\nWhile Barrick is at the top of the list of companies who could afford to buy into Bre-X, Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc also has the resources and the attractive stock price to make a bid, analyst Cohen pointed out.\n\"The size of this deposit and the potential involved here sort of limits it to those two,\" he said.\nOthers said the Bre-X play was not Placer Dome's style.  \n\"Definitely Placer has the capability to do it. I just don't think they have the stomach for it,\" said Allan.\nNewmont Gold Co, RTZ Corp PLC, Minorco SA and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc could also be in the running for Bre-X. However, their chances are not as good as Barrick's, analysts said, noting that Newmont, Freeport and RTZ already have large exposure in Indonesia.  \nWhile the Luxemburg-based Minorco, controlled by Anglo American Corp of South Africa  ANGL.J., has recently raised US$400 million, the company's stock lacks the high multiple that would make it attractive to Bre-X shareholders.\nMinorco could run into political problems if it were to make a bid for Bre-X, said one South African analyst who follows Minorco closely.\n\"The South Africans might not want to get into a situation that's so blatantly political,\" he said. \"It might backfire on them.\"  \nIf Barrick does eventually succeed in controlling the Busang deposit, it would go a long way to fulfilling Barrick chief executive Peter Munk's dream of building the world's largest gold company to supplant Anglo American, analysts said.\n\"It fits very nicely with Munk's strategy,\" said one analyst. \"Munk is not driven by money. He wants to have a legacy. He wants to be able to say he started with nothing and ended with the largest gold company in the world.", "Iomega Corp. said Thursday it plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics in a way that could lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices.\nThe reusable data storage system, to be known as \"n-hand,\" could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants.\nIn cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable \"digital film\" that would replace existing chemical photographic film.\n\"Our n-hand technology.... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices,\" said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement.\n\"We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices,\" added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a telephone interview.\nThe n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card.\nSeveral industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras.\nA digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted.\nJim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times.\nA Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods.\nIomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp.\nIn addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment.\n\"With'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,\" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system.\n\"This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,\" he said.\nBesides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years.\nShares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "China's power minister vowed Thursday to protect the interests of foreign investors expected to provide one-fifth of the 700 billion yuan ($84 billion) to be invested in power generation between 1996 and 2000.\nForeign investment in the electricity generation sector would be carefully channelled to boost China's domestic industry, power minister Shi Dazhen told a business conference.\n\"We have established a legal framework to protect foreign investors,\" Shi told reporters at the conference.\nBeijing would perfect its laws and regulations to ensure that investor interests were guaranteed, he said.\nChina's electricity generating capacity would hit 290,000 megawatts by the end of 2000 from 217,000 megawatts at the end of 1995, Shi said.\nChina would require around 700 billion yuan ($84.4 million) investment in the power sector during Beijing's state-set ninth five-year plan, which runs from 1996-2000, he said.\nForeign investors were expected to come up with 20 percent -- around $17 billion -- while the central government provided 40 percent and local authorities and enterprises shelled out the remaining 40 percent, he said but gave no details.\nThe investment estimates appeared to be lower than those made by other senior power officials last month, who said China would need $20 billion from abroad.\nShi said he was unaware of the $20 billion figure.\nPotential foreign investors have said an effective 15 percent limit on returns on investment from Chinese power plant projects is a major disincentive, but Shi waved aside such concerns, saying any specific limit would be impractical.\nChinese energy officials have consistently denied setting any limit on returns, although they have said the best rate from key projects is around 17 percent.\nChinese electricity prices are fixed by the state, which has kept prices low.\nShi said foreign investors remained keen to put their money behind Chinese efforts to build enough generating capacity to keep up with rocketing economic growth and to raise per capita capacity from the meagre 180 watts achieved by the end of 1995.\n\"Although the power industry has developed very quickly, because China has a population of 1.2 billion, the power supply is still very tight and the supply level is very low,\" he said.\n\"There is great enthusiasm among foreigners to invest in this sector,\" he said, adding that such investment should be carefully guided.\n\"The use of foreign investment must be combined with that of China's own power manufacturing industry, with foreign funds used to buy Chinese-made generating equipment,\" he said.\nForeign funds would be focused on high technology plants with capacity of 300 megawatts or more, he said.\nBeijing says it wants to replace inefficient thermal power stations that burn dirty high-sulphur coal with larger new plants and with nuclear and hydro-electric projects.", "The European Airbus consortium said on Tuesday it was confidently pressing ahead with studies on a 555-seat passenger plane despite a decision by archrival Boeing to scale back work on a larger jumbo jet.\nBoeing on Monday said market conditions did not justify the risk and expense of building a new version of its 747 jumbo jet, the 747-X, and it was diverting half the 1,000 staff on that project to smaller planes.\n\"We are confident the A3XX will meet market needs,\" an Airbus spokesman said. \"The signs from major airlines working with us on shaping the A3XX are definitely encouraging.\"\nAirbus, ever quick to seize on any perceived gaps in Boeing's armour, says airlines want an all-new plane rather than Boeing's 747-X, which the Airbus spokesman said was the \"end of the line for a product developed in the late 1960s\".\n\"Airlines want to fly into the 21st century facing forward, not backwards,\" the spokesman added.\nAirbus must attack Boeing's monopoly on the large-capacity segment and is studying designs for an A3XX product family which it hopes to launch in 1998 for service in 2003.\nIt wants to grab at least half of the aircraft market by the end of the decade, up from its estimated historic share of 35 percent. But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.\nThe four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.\nAirbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.\nA basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.\n\"A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,\" the Airbus spokesman said.\nAirbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.\nThe \"fragmentation\" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.\nBut Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.\nSaturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.\nAirbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre \"box\" at the airport terminal.\nIt is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.\nAirbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.", "He once sailed his shipping empire through rough waters, steered an even course between China and Britain for years, but navigating Hong Kong into Chinese rule in 1997 will be the challenge of his lifetime.\nShipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, chosen as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader on Wednesday after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, will take the helm on July 1.\n\"He will be charting the course for Hong Kong as it enters a new era. And he will be at the helm of what is at once an economic powerhouse and a dynamic, sophisticated metropolis,\" Governor Chris Patten, Britain's last colonial chief, said in a statement congratulating Tung on his victory.\nIt is a mission that has no precedent.\nThe territory that Tung governs will be the first British colony to have matured into a world trading economy and then handed back to a communist-ruled motherland.\nChina has promised the territory of 6.3 million people a great degree of autonomy and at least 50 more years of untrammeled capitalism but vowed to curb the pace of democratic reform.\nThe 59-year-old tycoon saw his fortunes almost dashed in the 1980s when the family firm met ill winds, but Beijing helped bail him out with a syndicated loan, and his firm regained its strength.\nIn his new role, Tung will have to tack between pro-democracy politicians who branded his triumph the death of democracy, the departing colonial British with their sense of lost empire, and a proud Beijing Communist leadership keen to set the stamp \"This is China\" on the map of Hong Kong forever.\nThe vocal pro-democracy lobby plans to challenge his authority with a no-confidence vote in the current legislature.\n\"What Hong Kong needs most is a champion for Hong Kong people as we face the unprecedented challenges of the handover -- not a spokesman for China,\" said Democratic Party leader Martin Lee.\nSome analysts predicted Hong Kong's own version of China's \"red princelings\" -- sons and daughters of senior Communist Party officials -- would move to centre stage from now.\nMembers of families closely tied to the Beijing government since the 1950s are favourites for the 60 seats in the new legislature or roles in Tung's inner advisory cabinet.\nThe new elite will look to people such as legislator Leung Chun-ying, a policeman's son who has emerged as Beijing's trusted lieutenant in the transition process.\nThe princelings also include figures such as Timothy Fok, eldest son of Beijing's most trusted man in Hong Kong, tycoon Henry Fok, a kingmaker in the contest that Tung won.\nTung must now swiftly lay down a gameplan for the next six months with Beijing, political analysts said.\nHe must also work closely with the politicians and business titans likely to be brought into the post-1997 provisional legislature and advisory cabinet known as the Executive Council.\n\"He will start out with a unity of support behind him at least from the more moderate and pro-China in Hong Kong,\" said political analyst Michael DeGolyer of the Baptist University.\n\"I think he's going to have to move rather rapidly to talk to the people in Beijing.

The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.\n\"This is a matter of principle,\" Pei said.\nChina was deeply disappointed when its application to join the world trade body as a founding member two years ago failed, and talks since in Geneva have proceeded at a snail's pace.\nHe said he expected little progress when ministers of the WTO's 125 member states meet in Singapore this week, with China attending under observer status, but said China would seize the opportunity to explain its stand in meetings on the sidelines.\n\"After we gain recognition of our status then the talks could more easily proceed,\" Pei said. \"There may be the possibility of concessions (by China) on some concrete issues.\"\nPei declined to say where China might be prepared to offer concessions in line with a \"road map\" presented to Beijing by Washington outlining liberalisations it wants before it will support Chinese membership.\nHe said China's economy was already remarkably open compared with some of its neighbours such as Japan and South Korea.\n\"When you go shopping in Beijing you see goods from all over the world on every shelf,\" he said. \"You don't see nearly so many Chinese products on foreign shelves.\"\nChinese President Jiang Zemin announced at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last month in the Philippines that China would slash average import tariffs to 15 percent by 2000 from the current 23 percent.\nPei said non-tariff barriers still existed in China, citing the service sector as one area to which foreign firms were eager to gain admittance, but insisted Beijing was gradualling pulling down these barriers.\n\"Opening up requires a process,\" he said. \"It is a fact that China is a backward country and must protect some parts of its economy. The demands on us must not be too harsh.\"\nPei offered a less optimistic view than China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen who has said talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997 as well as WTO chief Renato Ruggiero who has said next year could see a solution to the exclusion of the world's most populous nation from the world trade body.\nPei said 1997 seemed a rather ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on many issues, but said he hoped to see entry by 1999.\n\"There are both advantages and disadvantages to China from entry to the WTO,\" Pei said, setting off the access to worldwide markets for Chinese goods against the cost and competition its domestic industry would face.\n\"China's stand now is that it is up to the other side,\" Pei said.\n\"China actively wants membership but it can wait.

Net interim dividend per share increased by 12.7 percent to eight pence.\nEMI shares, under pressure in recent weeks on fears that music sales were faltering after a decade of strong growth, added 15p to 1,286p in a generally lower market.\n\"These are excellent interim results from the EMI Group,\" chairman Sir Colin Southgate said in a statement.\n\"They have been achieved against a background of variable growth in the major markets and mixed results from our competitors,\" he added. \"The increase in the interim dividend reflects our confidence in the long-term health of the music industry and EMI's position within it.\"\nFinance Director Simon Duffy said EMI remained confident that the global music business would continue to grow by some 6-8 percent annually in the medium to long-term.\n\"This year is looking a little bit below that level,\" said Duffy, saying that markets were patchy but that overall first half industry growth had been 5.5 percent. However, he added that the impact was diluted by the strength of sterling.\nThe market's sluggishness has recently been reflected by 100 layoffs at various labels within Warner Music and 400 job cuts at PolyGram NV -- another of the top five in the world music business.\nEMI said that sales in the United States were almost flat and declined slightly in France. But this was offset by improvements in Japan, Britain and Germany while Southeast Asia and Latin America boasted particularly large gains.\nTurnover from the EMI Music division was down marginally at around 1.1 billion pounds but improved margins helped to boost operating profits to 131.9 million pounds from 124.6 million.\nThe HMV division, grouping record and book stores chains, had an operating loss of 11 million pounds which the company said was in line with expectations as its international expansion continued.", "The general who led a bloody assault on Colombia's Supreme Court to quell leftist rebels holding 300 hostages in 1985 said on Friday that an attack was an option to end the Japanese embassy residence siege in Lima.\nGen. Jesus Armando Arias said Peru's President Alberto Fujimori should not cave in to the demands of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to free jailed comrades.\nElite forces from the United States, Israel or Britain could flush out the rebels with a \"minimum of bloodshed\" if they refused to negotiate, Arias told Reuters.\nMore than 100 people, mostly hostages and including 11 top judges, died in the 27-hour battle Arias led to dislodge M-19 guerrillas from Bogota's Palace of Justice in Nov. 1985.\n\"Training techniques have progressed rapidly and there are elite forces that have the ability to seize back the (Japanese embassy residence in Lima) with the minimum of blood and damage,\" Arias said in a phone interview.\n\"But given the strong international interests in this case the Peruvian government should try to negotiate and reach an agreement. Bowing to the MRTA's demands on releasing prisoners would, however, set a dangerous legal precedent,\" he said.\nArias, who now teaches at a military academy, said he still believed the assault he led was the correct tactic. \"The M-19 broke in killing people right, left and centre. We could only respond in kind to that type of violence,\" he said.\nTelevision images showed tanks firing 90mm shells into the courts building before smashing down the steel entrance doors remain vivid. Dynamite and automatic weapons fire reduced the interior of the building to rubble. More than 11 years later it has still not been fully reconstructed.\nAnother official involved in that incident, former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo, said the Colombian military ignored the government's orders and went ahead with the assault. He said Fujimori must keep a tight control on Peru's military if he wanted to avoid another bloodbath.\nFive years before the Palace of Justice attack, the M-19 stormed the Dominican embassy in Bogota. It held 57 hostages, including 19 diplomats, for 61 days before Fidel Castro intervened and negotiated the rebels' safe passage to Cuba.\nThe M-19 leader who led the Dominican embassy siege, Rosemberg Pavon, called on the MRTA earlier this week to keep its cool and offered to act as go-between in the Lima drama.", "The Federal Communications Commission is expected to curb its power to approve or reject long-distance rates by ending a Depression-era rule requiring telephone carriers to notify the FCC before rate changes.\nThe new rules, set to be adopted on Tuesday, are meant to pump more competition into the $70 billion long-distance market and trim government red tape for AT&T Corp, MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and other long-distance carriers, said FCC officials.  \nThe 1934 rule that is headed for the scrap heap has forced long-distance companies to notify the FCC in advance of plans to change rates or offer new services through \"tariff\" filings with the agency.\nIt was intended originally to let regulators review the changes while giving the public an advance look, although the language contained in the filings is arcane and read by few.\nRegulators say the new approach will let companies respond more quickly to competitors' price changes -- without the need to file burdensome paperwork with the FCC.  \nThey also say it will reduce the opportunity for companies to collude tacitly on long-distance rates.\nAnd carriers will have to notify residential customers directly of a rate change. Currently, they unveil any rate increases through the complex tariff filings.\nThe new approach represents the first major step the FCC has taken under a provision of the new telecommunications law allowing it to shed outdated rules if the public interest is not harmed.\nCurrently, tariff filings take effect one day after their submission to the FCC. But it has not always been that way.  \nWhen it was considered a \"dominant\" long-distance carrier, AT&T complained that the filings offered competitors an early look at its plans, allowing the others to mimic the move and implement it beforehand.\nThe top long-distance company had to wait up to 60 days after a tariff filing for a new promotional plan before it could act on the plan. A year ago, the FCC ended AT&T's dominant carrier status. That also ended the long delays.  \nThe FCC tried to eliminate long-distance tariff filings for \"non-dominant\" carriers such as MCI and Sprint about a dozen years ago. But a court said the agency lacked the power to do so. The FCC then asked Congress to change the law.\nIndustry officials have sought -- but apparently without success -- to retain the option of filing tariffs for certain residential telephone plans, saying that would make it easier to let consumers know what their phone rates are.\n\"We think there ought to be something in place for the mass marketplace,\" said an AT&T spokesman.  \nHe added that tariff filings allow residential customers to know the terms and conditions of their service. And he said they save the company the expense of having to communicate those terms and conditions to individual customers.\nBut critics complain that such a practice would make it tougher for consumers to know when a rate rise was coming, because it would be buried in the jargon of the tariff filing.\nOfficials do favor ending tariff filings for big business customers, paperwork that can run hundreds of pages. Ending the practice, they say, would give carriers added flexibility to negotiate the best deals with big customers.\nBusiness users agree.\n\"It allows for individual customers to negotiate the best terms and conditions for them, while preserving the normal customer-supplier confidentiality we see in other contracts,\" said Ray Cline, director of information systems for the American Petroluem Institute, an oil industry trade group.", "British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc expects its new banking venture to turn in profits \"in a relatively short period of time,\" marketing director Kevin McCarten told Reuters in an interview.\n\"We see this as a commercial venture...it is not a huge sink of money,\" he said.\nSainsbury announced on Friday that it had applied for authorisation from the Bank of England to set up Sainsbury's Bank in which it would have 55 percent with Bank of Scotland taking 45 percent.  \nHe said the banking service would offer \"great products...at better value than is currently available,\" but declined to comment on possible interest rates on accounts.\nSainsbury will draw on its database of customers signed up to its Reward loyalty card and other store cards for direct marketing of the banking facilities, McCarten said, but added that it was not planning to limit access to these customers.\n\"Our objective is to build (the business) across the UK,\" he said.  \nSainsbury currently has about five stores in Scotland, while Bank of Scotland will benefit because it has a limited presence south of the border.\n\"It's a lovely distribution channel,\" a Bank of Scotland spokesman told Reuters, adding that the new bank would have its own identity and would not carry the Bank of Scotland logo.\nMcCarten said there would not initially be banking counters in stores but added it could not be ruled out for the future.  \nNo decision has yet been reached on use of cash dispensers, the Bank of Scotland spokesman said, although he ruled out stand-alone machines.\nMcCarten said the banking facilities would be \"completely separate\" from its Reward loyalty card other than using the database.\nHe added that the aim was to encourage customers to see banking as part of Sainsbury's supermarket offer, which should have a knock-on effect for the stores.\n\"If you can increase customer spend a little, you grow your business,\" McCarten said.", "Russia's Western oil joint ventures are finding it increasingly difficult to export their output in the amounts needed to stay profitable as Moscow seeks to give domestic producers more pipeline space.\nJoint ventures (JVs) produce only a trickle of Russia's crude oil -- but they need to export most, if not all, of their output to make money on their investments.\nBut Russian energy officials, who once courted Western oil majors and independents with promises of tax breaks and priority access to crowded pipelines, are rethinking the terms on which they want foreign oil firms to work in Russia.\n\"The pipelines are fairly close to capacity, so any increase (in exports) will be at somebody's expense, and that will be the JVs,\" said Julian Leigh of the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London in a recent interview.\nRussia's tightening of access to its export pipelines is a barometer of how willing Moscow will be in coming years to let big-ticket foreign investors with planned, multi-billion dollar production-sharing contracts export the volumes they need.\nMost of those projects will require new pipelines -- but in the initial stages, they will probably use existing pipelines.\n\"It's becoming more and more difficult,\" said Igor Ishkayev, Moscow-based representative for the Tatex joint venture, whose foreign partner is Global Natural Resources of the United States' unit Texneft Inc.\n\"The big companies, like LUKoil, can send out as much as they want. Nobody cares about a little joint venture.\"\nAbout six joint ventures out of the 40 or so producing in Russia and exporting have the right to export 100 percent of their output until September 1997. Others enjoy tax breaks.\nMost ventures in theory have priority access.\nBut in practice, they are often elbowed aside from month to month depending on world oil prices, the amount domestic producers want to export and government export programmes.\nWhen asked about priority access for the ventures, a Transneft official dealing with exports, who declined to be identified, said:\n\"We don't distinguish between oil produced by our companies and oil produced by joint ventures.\"\nTransneft, the state oil pipeline monopoly, works with so-called designated coordinators -- Russia's large producers, who are often interested in increasing their own exports -- to allocate pipeline space.\n\"Access to Transneft pipelines is based on personal relationships with the Transneft people,\" said analyst Zarko Stefanovski of T Hoare & Co in London in a recent interview.\n\"Russian producers are going to increase the pressure to be given more pipeline capacity -- this will certainly be a problem in the future.\"\nJoint ventures accounted for 4.8 percent of total Russian output last year, or around 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to State Statistics Committee figures, up from four percent in 1994. But they account for about 10 percent of Russia's 2.0 million bpd exports.\n\"Priority access will hardly be continued next year, which will affect the operations of this joint venture very negatively,\" said Alexander Khrustalov, marketing specialist at KomiArcticOil, whose Western partner is British Gas Plc and which exports about 90 percent of its 25,000 bpd output.\nCustoms officials, who now make policy as well as implementing it, said in September that some prominent ventures could be liable for millions of dollars in taxes and fines for so-called \"excess\" exports outside their exemptions.\n\"The issue is not necessarily the length of the tax exemption, it's the intent behind it,\" said one top Western oil executive who asked not to be named.", "Supreme Court justices Wednesday sharply questioned rules governing so-called derivative investments and foreign currency trading in a case that could have wide repercussions for both markets.\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has traditionally prosecuted crooks who ripped off the public with fraudulent investments. But sophisticated investors such as big banks have been allowed to trade similiar financial instruments with little direct regulation, market participants said.\nThat distinction has been blurred in recent years, as defendants accused of fraud by the CFTC have sought to rely on an exemption from regulation, relied on by the bigger players, in a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nThe amendment was added at the request of the Treasury Department to ensure that sophisticated investors trading in foreign currency and a few other markets would not be subject to uneccessary regulation by the CFTC.\nLower courts have made conflicting rulings about the 1974 amendment and the Supreme Court decided last year to hear the case of William Dunn, a foreign currency investment advisor charged with fraud by the CFTC after losing $95 million of his clients' money.\nJeffrey Minear, assistant to the Solicitor General -- the federal government's representative before the Supreme Court -- defended the CFTC's prosecution of Dunn before the court Wednesday. Minear argued that the 1974 exemption for \"transactions in foreign currency\" did not cover Dunn's trading in foreign currency options, one type of derivative. A derivative is an investment whose value is derived from a stock, bond, currency, commodity or other instrument.\nBut justices questioned Minear's distinction, which relied heavily on the particular meaning of the word \"in.\"\nCongress was \"not using consistent language\" in the commodity laws passed in 1974 and since then, Justice Antonin Scalia said. \"They use in, they use on, they use involving.\"\nMinear drew a sharp rebuke from Chief Justice William Rehnquist when he later argued that Congress expressed greater concern about fraudulent use of options than other types of investments under a 1922 commodity trading law.\n\"Perhaps it was true in 1922 but that doesn't prove it's true now,\" the chief justice interjected.\nGary Stumpp, Dunn's lawyer, argued that other federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trading but not the CFTC.\nSeveral Wall Street trade groups and big banks filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Dunn's position. They warned that if the court upheld the CFTC's position, the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the United States might overseas.\nOn the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the court throws out the CFTC's case against Dunn.\nBrooksley Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, attended the argument but declined to comment afterwards.\nA decision is not expected for at least a few months. Several members of Congress have said they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment, possibly rendering the verdict in the Dunn case moot.", "KPMG, one of the world's big six international accounting and consultancy firms, believes investment in infrastructure and technology has put it on track to hasten revenue growth.\n\"We would like to be growing faster and are committed to growing faster,\" Jon Madonna, chairman of KPMG International told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\nEarlier the group reported an eight percent rise in worldwide revenues for the fiscal year to September 30, 1996 to $8.1 billion, up from $7.5 billion the year before.\nMadonna, who earlier this year said revenue growth in excess of 10 percent was a reasonable expectation, said KPMG had invested heavily in infrastructure and technology during the year and this would pay off in terms of further growth.\nHe said all sides of the business had performed well over the year but stressed that significant growth in revenues was likely to come from the consulting side of the business rather than from the traditional backbone of auditing and tax.\n\"If you look at where the great opportunity is, its on the consulting side,\" Madonna said.\nWhile KPMG's growth rate for the year was lower than rival firm Andersen Worldwide, which last month reported a 16 percent increase in 1996 revenues to $9.4 billion, Madonna said he was not disappointed with the firm's result.\nWhen looked at on a dollar-adjusted basis, the 1996 revenue growth was the same as for the previous year, Madonna said.\nBut there was still work to be done.\n\"I said a year ago we need to be growing faster. I just think we have got to do a lot better than that. It's a big ship and you don't turn it around in just a few days,\" he added.\nThe investment and strategic moves KPMG had made had ensured it would be in a strong position for the future. \"The road we are on is the right road\".\nMadonna said the firm's partners were agreed that the moves it had made over the year were correct and the fact that everybody wanted faster growth confirmed the need for large-scale investments.\n\"We are making sizeable dollar investments in terms of infrastructure and product development.\" This included around $500 million a year on technology and \"well in excess\" of $100 million on products.\nFor Madonna the key is what the partnership, which employs more than 77,000 people and has more than 6,250 partners, is doing in three years' time.\nThe strategy which KPMG has embarked on will not be altered to achieve further revenue growth and areas such as developing new products and establishing a framework of common industries and a common infrastructure across the firm's worldwide business will continue.\nMadonna, who believes there will be further consolidation among the big accountancy firms, said KPMG will also stick to growing from within rather than through large-scale acquisition.\nThe number of major accounting firms in the world has dropped from eight in the mid-1980s to six, with a rise in competition from other types of firms.\nBut Madonna does not see KPMG making any big buys.\n\"There will be local acquisitions and mergers down the road but I don't think anything big is on the horizon.\"", "The growing business of doing business on the Internet poses a major challenge to tax collectors, but no special taxes should be imposed in cyberspace, the government said in report released Thursday.\n\"Treasury believes that these new technologies should not be used to justify new taxes,\" the Treasury Department draft report said. \"Accordingly, Treasury is not considering any type of value added tax,'bit tax,' or other new excise tax on electronic commerce.\"\nInstead, the current system should evolve to tax income from all sources in a consistent manner, the department said.\n\"Our overall tax policy goal in this area should emulate policy in other areas -- maintain neutrality, fairness and simplicity -- a policy which serves to encourage all desirable economic activity new and old,\" the report said.\nBusinesses are already struggling with tax proposals from state and local governments, according to Kent Johnson, head of sales and transaction tax practice at KPMG Peat Marwick.\n\"State governments don't feel the same way as the federal government, but this report may be a good starting point for discussing all the issues,\" Johnson said.\nThis year, about $1 billion of goods and services will be sold online, growing to over $7 billion by the year 2000, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.\nBut the myriad tax laws and regulations affecting businesses may not keep pace with the fast-paced, often chaotic growth of the worldwide computer network.\nBuyers and sellers on the Internet can be in different states or even different countries, complicating the task of collecting tax at the \"source\" of a transaction.\nThe department also said it was worried that tax evaders could use the anonymity provided by the Internet as a mask to avoid reporting income or to transfer money to offshore bank accounts.\nBut the report made no recommendations about how the government should deal with tax evasion issues. \"Treasury intends to study, and requests comments on these issues,\" the report said.\nThe report is available on the Treasury's web site, http://www.ustreas.gov.\nThe report on taxation is likely to be followed by reports on other aspects of online commerce that the department is studying, including consumer protection, electronic money, bank regulation and law enforcement, officials said.", "Economic commentators in Hong Kong are sounding alarms about the unbridled optimism spurring stock and property prices to new highs ahead of the British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.\nConcerns are mounting that rising price pressures could inflate a collapsible bubble on the assumption that China will support Hong Kong's economy through the transition regardless of any political disruption.\n\"The term'moral hazard' refers to the apparently growing belief in local markets that there is little dramatic down-side risk -- as opposed to short-term volatility -- because ultimately China will suppport Hong Kong markets,\" Ian Perkin, chief economist with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.\nIn contrast to earlier fears that political uncertainty could torpedo Hong Kong's economy in 1997, domestic confidence in China's determination to keep the economy stable through the transition is so high that an unexpected problem has arisen -- price instability.\nEconomists are starting to revise upward their inflation forecasts for 1997 in response to booming stock and luxury property prices.\n\"The outlook for 1997 is going to be less good than we thought,\" said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers.\nSalomon has raised its 1997 forecast for the territory's benchmark consumer price index to 7 percent from 6.6 percent late last year, and Chan said further increases are possible.\nSudden strength in Hong Kong's stock market in the middle of last year was welcomed as proof of confidence in the colony's future under China, and evidence of an economic turnaround following an export slump early last year and three years of austerity in China.\nBut the optimism became concern in November when speculation emerged in the luxury end of Hong Kong's property market.\nCiting anecdotal evidence, Perkin argued that overseas and domestic investors confident of China's commitment to economic stability in Hong Kong are rushing to buy high-end properties in anticipation of short-term gains.\nThe Hong Kong government has since strongly supported a set of anti-speculation measures by the Real Estate Developers Association, and warned it will step in if there are signs that speculation is filtering down to the middle or low end of the property market.\nBut economists said property price volatility would eventually stimulate overall inflation, even though it has been restricted so far to the high end of the market.\n\"This will not be good for inflation expectations,\" Chan said. \"In general, people will expect the higher prices in the luxury sector to affect medium and small flats.\"\nChan estimates an overall rise of 30 percent in property prices will translate into at least a 15 percent increase in rents this year, which account for 25 percent of the Hong Kong government's benchmark consumer price index.\nFood prices, which account for 37 percent of the index, are expected to rise by at least 8 percent this year after holding steady last year.\nHong Kong will also suffer from its currency link to the U.S. dollar. If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about 1 percent, Chan said.\nSuch low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.\nChina, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.\n\"There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,\" Perkin wrote. \"It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.\"", "A British High Court judge rejected on Thursday a $1.8 billion claim by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) against accountancy firm Ernst & Whinney, now known as Ernst & Young.\nBCCI was closed by central banks in 1991 and collapsed with debts of more than $12 billion amid evidence of massive fraud and money laundering which has since led to a complex series of court cases, both criminal and civil, in several countries.\nJudge Hugh Laddie said the claim by the liquidators of BCCI (Overseas), Deloitte & Touche, that Ernst & Whinney owed a duty of care to the bank was based \"long on assertion and deficient on relevant facts\".\nErnst & Young said the original claim against its predecessor firm was for $10 billion but this was reduced to $3.5 billion in June 1995.\nFollowing this judgement, the principal claim against Ernst & Whinney now stands at around $1.7 billion in respect of the firm's 1985 and 1986 audit of BCCI Holdings SA and BCCI SA.\nA similar claim remains outstanding against another international accountancy firm, Price Waterhouse, which took over as auditor to BCCI in 1987 when Ernst & Whinney resigned.\n\"The BCCI liquidators have now had struck out, or been forced to withdraw, 85 percent of the claims originally brought against Ernst & Whinney,\" said Ernst & Young senior partner Nick Land. \"We look forward to dealing with the remaining 15 percent in a similar fashion and to recovering our costs which are substantial.\"\nLand attacked the liquidators for choosing to spend millions of pounds pursuing what he called \"speculative and unfounded claims\" rather than making money available to those who suffered losses from the BCCI collapse.\nDeloitte & Touche was not immediately available to comment on the judgement.\nAfter a five year struggle, BCCI creditors began to receive payments last month. Deloitte & Touche said it was making a payment of $2.65 billion, equal to 24.5 percent of their claims.\nBCCI had assets of $24 billion and operations in 71 countries at the time of the collapse.", "Insurance group Guardian Royal Exchange PLC on Tuesday reported a sharp fall in 1996 profits and said it was considering a major acquisition within the next twelve months, possibly in the life sector.\nThe company blamed tough competition and the worst catastrophe weather claims in the U.S. for 75 years for the profits decline, while bad weather and continuing subsidence losses in Britain also taking a toll.\nBut news that Guardian may spend around one billion pounds ($1.6 billion) on a life acquisition and disappointment that it had no plans to return capital to shareholders prompted the shares to reverse an initial rise on the back of the results.\nThe company told industry analysts that a UK life acquisition was top of the list, that it could comfortably spend one billion pounds and would be prepared to spend more if necessary.\nGuardian is not a major player in the UK life market and on the plus side an acquisition could give it critical mass and economies of scale.\nBut the possible goodwill write off such an  acquisition could prompt was a concern, analysts said.\n\"Guardian looks very expensive on both an earnings and a dividend basis. The asset value is the only rationale as to why the shares are sitting at current levels,\" said one.\n\"Any large life acquisition would almost certainly result in paying a very substantial premium to asset value.\"\nThe decline in 1996 profits was broadly in-line with market expectations. Despite continuing pressures on margins, Guardian chief executive John Robins said there were bright spots.\nThe company had seen some hardening of premiums in selected sectors and regions such as British motor insurance and difficult conditions in Germany had not been as severe as some commentators had forecast.\nIt predicted rates in the motor market could rise by as much as eight percent over the next twelve months with household rates likely to see smaller increases of the order of two percent.\nCompetition in commercial markets continued to be fierce, though even here there were hopes of an upturn in rates by the end of the year.\nFor 1996, however, Guardian trading profits were down over 17 percent at 281 million pounds, before restructuring costs of 39 million pounds.\nPre-tax profits including investment gains dropped to 651 million pounds from 812 million pounds last year. Total premium income was down only slightly at 3.73 billion pounds.\nWhile competition had risen and was likely to increase further, Guardian said it was confident about the future and that this was reflected in the increase in the dividend payout for the year by one pence to 10.0 pence per share.\nThe figures were broadly in line with market expectations although the headline operating profit was flattered by reserve releases to the tune of 10 to 15 million pounds and by a profit contribution from the internal reinsurance operation which may not be repeated.\nProgress had been made on the integration of last year's acquisition of Legal & General's commercial business and of the RAC insurance business.\nRestructuring of the group's operations in Britain was also moving ahead, the company said.\nA new management structure was set up at the beginning of 1997 and cost savings in the next two years are expected to equal this year's 39 million pounds of exceptional charges.\nThose charges are expected to cover all the costs required to complete the restructuring over the next 12 to 18 months and while these might include further redundancies, these were unlikely to be of the same order of previous rounds of layoffs.

Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.\nIn the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.\nB.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.\nLawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.\nB.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.\nIf the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as \"medical devices\" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.\nResponding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.\n\"We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,\" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.\nTurning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.\nIn financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year.

I believe there are much better ways of promoting cooperation,\" Gurria said at a news conference. He added that \"the decision is often based on criteria other than those that one would rationally take into consideration.\"\nLast year, Colombia was struck off the United States' list of allies in the drug war. Mexico came under severe criticism but managed to get certification and escape sanctions.\nMexico has since set up a ministerial contact group to address the issue with Washington, and that has led to an improved climate between the two governments, Gurria said.\nColombia has continued to come under heavy criticism from the United States for its perceived failure to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.\nPoliticians and political analysts were divided on whether Colombia would regain certification this March in the wake of of a new law to strip drug kingpins of narcotics profits.\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 80 percent of the world's cocaine is supplied by Colombia while more than half that on the streets of U.S. cities has been transported through Mexico.", "Freed from its slow-growing data storage and imaging businesses, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.

projects are finding out that close ties to top government figures, delicate talks with new partners and careful handling of oil-rich, ambitious regions are vital.\nWestern oil companies eyeing Arctic reserves need close Kremlin relationships and savvy negotiating skills more than ever, now that Moscow has a cooler, tougher attitude toward Western participation in oil production-sharing deals.\nSupport from President Boris Yeltsin, who oversaw the transformation of the oil sector into privatised companies and who underwent heart surgery on Tuesday, is crucial.\nSo is a willingness to get out the pencils and redo budgets after talks with increasingly demanding Russian partners.\nThe factors -- some old, some new --  will decide whether deals stay on the drawing board or get off the ground.\nIn one of Russia's most prominent projects, Amoco Corp of the United States and Russian oil giant YUKOS are in tortuous talks that, analysts said, revolve around how to accomodate YUKOS shareholder Bank Menatep.\n\"Any time you add a new player to the game, you need to re-establish what the ground rules are,\" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president and resident manager of Amoco

Instead, he has proposed selling the stake to multiple investors.\nCurrently, the state owns a 60% stake in Komercni Banka, and the proposed sale would reduce that to a minority stake. Rusnok believes that selling the stake to multiple investors would be the most beneficial option for the bank, its customers, and the Czech economy as a whole.\nIn his statement, Rusnok stated that \"a gradual reduction of the state's stake should aim to sell the shares to multiple investors, whether they are foreign or domestic.\" He went on to explain that selling to multiple investors would increase the bank's capital base and provide it with the necessary resources to pursue its growth ambitions.\nRusnok acknowledged that there have been concerns that reducing the state's stake could lead to Komercni Banka being bought out by a foreign entity. However, he dismissed those concerns, saying that \"the bank is well-managed and has a strong market position, making it attractive to a range of investors.\"\nMany financial experts have praised Rusnok's proposal, saying that it would help to diversify the bank's shareholder base and make it more resilient to changes in the economy. They have also pointed out that a wider range of investors would increase competition and make the bank more efficient.\nThe announcement comes after a turbulent few years for Komercni Banka, which has struggled to keep pace with the rapid changes in the financial sector. Last year, the bank posted a net profit of 6.2 billion crowns ($272.19 million), down from 8.3 billion the previous year. The decline in profits was mainly attributed to a sharp rise in provisions for bad loans.\nRusnok believes that selling the stake to multiple investors would help the bank to weather the storm and emerge stronger in the long run. \"A more diversified shareholder base will provide the bank with more stability and reduce the risk of any one shareholder having too much influence,\" he said.\nThe proposal has been well-received by industry experts, with many predicting that it will lead to a positive outcome for the bank and its customers. However, there is still some uncertainty about the timing and specifics of the sale. Rusnok has said that the sale will be carried out in a gradual manner, but no further details have been provided at this stage.\nNonetheless, the decision to sell the state's stake to multiple investors will undoubtedly be a positive step for Komercni Banka and the Czech economy as a whole. The move will not only provide the bank with the capital it needs to grow, but it will also help to diversify the financial sector and increase competition.

The protest occurred on the morning of February 17, 2021, causing discomfort and delay for many commuters and business owners.\nThe group of protesters, primarily composed of transit workers and union activists, organized the demonstration to show their opposition to the budget cuts proposed by the city council, which primarily targeted transportation, infrastructure, and healthcare.\nAs a part of this demonstration, the protesters entered the subway station, chanting slogans, and carrying banners that read messages such as \"Invest in our public services, not cuts,\" \"Save our transit system,\" and \"Cuts hurt our families.\"\nThe protesters also locked themselves to the turnstiles, preventing commuters from entering the subway station. Consequently, the police had to intervene, detaining some of the protesters to clear the way for commuters.\nWhile the protesters targeted the subway station, others targeted key financial districts in Toronto, including Bay Street and King Street. They formed human chains to prevent workers from entering the buildings, causing businesses to close for the day.\nSeveral small business owners, economic analysts, and civil rights activists have criticized the protests, saying that it was unfair to disrupt businesses that had nothing to do with the budget cuts. Still, the leader of the protest, Tim Maguire, president of CUPE Ontario, maintained that the protest was necessary to drive home the message that cuts to public services affected the community's health, safety, and future.\n\"This demonstration shows our collective power. We will not tolerate austerity measures that compromise the basic necessities of our lives. Our jobs, wages, and healthcare are not up for negotiation,\" said Tim Maguire.\nThe budget cut proposal was initially tabled by Mayor Harper, saying that the city needs to reduce spending and eliminate the budget deficit in four years. In a statement released after the protest, Mayor Harper said the demonstration was unwarranted and disrespectful to the city's citizens and businesses.\n\"We understand that the budget cut may cause some discomfort initially, but we also recognise that it is a necessary step to ensure that our city's finances remain healthy and viable in the long run,\" criticized the mayor.\nMeanwhile, commuters who were stuck in the subway station expressed frustration and disappointment with the demonstration, saying that it was unfair to hold them hostage and cause them to be late for work and other appointments.\nAs the protest grew more intense, the police had to intervene and clear the subway station and business districts. The protest dispersed peacefully, with the protesters promising to continue with the demonstration until the budget cuts are reversed.\nIn conclusion, the protest that paralyzed the Toronto subway and businesses reflected the growing anger and frustration of the citizens with the proposed budget cuts. While the protesters argue that the cuts would hurt the community, including the transportation and healthcare systems, the city council insists that these measures are necessary to balance the books and reduce the budget deficit. As it stands, the two sides are at odds, with no immediate solution in sight.", "As Europe approaches the midway point of the summer season, Central and Eastern European (CEE) stock markets are basking in the glow of spectacular growth, driven in part by a global economic rebound, which has fueled investor optimism. But as the region's economies continue to face headwinds, CEE investors are assessing the sustainability of the market's growth in the coming months.\nThe CEE region has been a standout performer so far this year, with the Vienna Stock Exchange leading the charge, gaining 24.3% year-to-date (YTD), followed by the Prague Stock Exchange, up 19.2% YTD, and the Warsaw Stock Exchange, up 11.5% YTD. This compares to the Euro Stoxx 50, which is up 17.5% YTD, and the S&P 500, up 18% YTD.\nThe region's strong performance can be traced back to the rebound in global oil prices, which has had a positive impact on CEE energy stocks. Additionally, the European Union's economic recovery fund has injected new life into the region's economies, providing a much-needed boost to domestic demand.\nAnother factor behind the region's growth is the successful vaccine rollout, which has allowed countries to begin relaxing COVID-19 restrictions, leading to an increase in business activity. And, as global inflation concerns drive investors away from bonds and towards equities, the CEE region has emerged as a promising investment opportunity.\nDespite strong economic growth, investors remain cautious about the region's long-term prospects. While many CEE countries have made significant strides over the past decade, economic growth and investment have not been evenly distributed throughout the region.\nHungary, for example, has seen tremendous growth, driven in part by infrastructure investments from the government. At the same time, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria have not seen the same level of growth due to a lack of infrastructure investment. While EU recovery funds will undoubtedly help narrow the gap, it will take years to close the divide completely.\n\"The economic growth in the region is solid, but we need to remain mindful of the fact that some countries have simply taken longer than others,\" said Jian Xie, Senior Vice President at Moody's Investors Service. \"While some countries have made great strides over the past decade, others still have some work to do.\"\nMoreover, while the region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains highly sensitive to changes in global economic conditions. With the Delta variant of COVID-19 still spreading, there are concerns that the recovery could be hampered by future waves of the pandemic.\nAdditionally, the region's economies remain highly dependent on exports. While the recovery in global demand has been a boon for CEE exporters, it also leaves the economies vulnerable to a further slowdown in global trade.\n\"Investors need to be mindful of the fact that the CEE region remains highly dependent on exports,\" said Xie. \"This means that any slowdown in global trade will have a significant impact on the region's economic growth.\"\nDespite these concerns, analysts remain bullish on the region's long-term prospects. Given the region's favorable demographic profile, low labor costs, and improving infrastructure, it remains poised for strong growth in the coming years.\n\"The CEE region has all of the ingredients for long-term economic growth,\" said Xie. \"The challenge is ensuring that the growth is sustainable and evenly distributed throughout the region.\"\nWith the summer season in full swing, investors are taking a cautious approach to the region's bourses, keeping a close eye on global economic conditions and the ongoing fight against COVID-19. While the CEE region's growth has been impressive so far this year, it remains to be seen whether the summer sun will remain shining on the bourses over the long term.", "Nalco Chemical Co, one of the leading specialty chemical companies in the world, announced today that it expects double-digit earnings growth for the upcoming financial year.

Lo emphasized that the new legislature will be set up to support Hong Kong's development and ensure that the city remains safe, prosperous, and stable.\nThe China-appointed legislature, which is expected to be set up in the near future, is intended to replace the current Legislative Council in Hong Kong. The Legislative Council, which is made up entirely of elected members, has been the subject of controversy in recent years, with many accusing the council of being too liberal and failing to represent the views of the majority of Hong Kong citizens.\nLo, who is a prominent figure in the pro-Beijing camp, stated that the new legislature will operate in accordance with the Chinese Constitution and the Basic Law of Hong Kong. He emphasized that the new body will be committed to upholding the principles of \"One Country, Two Systems\" and \"Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong.\"\nLo also sought to dispel concerns that the new legislature would undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions. He stated that the new body would work in close cooperation with the existing government and other institutions in Hong Kong, and that it would seek to work with all parties to achieve the common good.\nThe pro-Beijing party leader also outlined the priorities of the new legislature. He emphasized that it would focus on economic growth, job creation, and social stability. He stated that the new body would seek to create a favorable business environment for investors and support the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises in the city.\nLo also addressed concerns over the proposed legislation to prevent acts of terrorism and subversion in Hong Kong. He emphasized that the new legislation would be aimed at targeting only those individuals and organizations that pose a threat to the security and stability of Hong Kong. He stated that the new legislation would not be used to suppress dissent or infringe on the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens.\nThe proposed China-appointed legislature has been the subject of much controversy in Hong Kong since it was first announced. Many opposition politicians and activists have criticized the plan, arguing that it represents a blatant attempt by Beijing to undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions.\nOpposition leaders have called for a boycott of the new legislature, and have staged numerous protests and demonstrations in recent months. Many have accused Beijing of trying to erode the freedoms and autonomy that have made Hong Kong one of the world's most vibrant and dynamic cities.\nDespite the opposition, pro-Beijing leaders have remained steadfast in their support for the new legislature. They argue that it is necessary to strengthen the stability and security of Hong Kong, and to ensure that the city remains a prosperous and vibrant hub of economic activity in the region.\nThe proposed legislation has also sparked concern internationally, with many Western democracies expressing their concern about the impact of the new legislation on human rights and freedoms in Hong Kong. The United States and other Western countries have warned China that any attempt to erode the autonomy of Hong Kong institutions would be met with strong international condemnation and action.\nDespite these concerns, however, Beijing has shown little sign of backing down from its plans for the new legislation. Many analysts predict that the new legislature will be set up in the coming months, and that it will represent a major shift in the political landscape of Hong Kong.\nAs the debate over the new legislation continues to rage, it is clear that Hong Kong is facing a pivotal moment in its history. The city's future is at stake, and the decisions made in the coming months and years will have a lasting impact on the people of Hong Kong and the wider region.", "Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has warned that its profit outlook could be subdued in the coming year. The bank cites a competitive housing market and rising operating costs as the main reasons for its caution.\nThe housing market in Australia has been a key driver of the country's economy over the past few years. However, the market has cooled somewhat in recent months. There has been a reduction in the number of people looking to buy property, driven in part by stricter lending standards imposed on banks by regulators. This has led to increased competition among banks for a smaller pool of borrowers.\nCBA is the largest mortgage lender in Australia, with a market share of around 20%. Despite this, the bank has been forced to compete with other lenders on price, offering discounts and other incentives to win business. This has put pressure on the bank's margins, as it seeks to maintain profitability.\nThe cooling housing market has also had an impact on CBA's revenue streams. The bank's wealth management division, which includes its funds management and financial advice businesses, has seen a reduction in net inflows. This is due to lower demand from customers for investment products, as they stay cautious in the current economic environment.\nMeanwhile, CBA's operating costs have continued to rise. The bank has been investing heavily in technology, as it seeks to improve its digital services and remain competitive in the fast-changing financial services landscape. It has also been spending money on compliance and risk management, following a number of high-profile scandals in the industry.\nAll of these factors have led CBA to warn that its profit outlook could be subdued in the coming year. The bank said it expects its earnings to be impacted by \"ongoing margin pressure in the retail banking business, subdued growth in lending volumes, and higher operating expenses\".\nCBA's caution comes as the broader Australian banking sector faces a number of headwinds. In addition to the cooling housing market, banks are also facing the ongoing fallout from the Royal Commission into misconduct in the industry. The Commission, which concluded earlier this year, exposed a series of unethical practices in the sector, and has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and tougher penalties.\nAs a result, the banks are having to invest heavily in compliance and risk management, while also facing the prospect of fines and compensation payments for past misdeeds. This has put further pressure on their bottom lines.\nHowever, there are some bright spots for CBA and the wider banking sector. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates to a record low of 1%, in a bid to stimulate the economy. This should help to boost demand for loans, which could benefit the banks.\nIn addition, the government has announced plans to ease the burden of responsible lending rules on banks, which could make it easier for them to lend to customers. The move has been welcomed by the banking sector, which has criticised the current rules for being overly burdensome.\nDespite these positive developments, however, CBA remains cautious about the future. The bank said it will continue to focus on improving efficiency and productivity, in order to maintain profitability in a challenging environment.\nIn a statement, CBA CEO Matt Comyn said: \"We are operating in a challenging environment, but we remain focused on delivering for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to invest in our business and make the necessary changes to adapt to the changing marketplace.\" \nOverall, CBA's warning of a subdued profit outlook is a reminder of the challenges facing the Australian banking sector. Despite record low interest rates and measures to stimulate the economy, banks are still grappling with an uncertain economic outlook, increased regulatory scrutiny, and intense competition. It remains to be seen how long these headwinds will last, and how successful banks will be in navigating them.", "Paris, France - Lagardere, the French multinational media conglomerate, has announced a deal that will ensure its electronics subsidiary, Lagardere Electronics, remains under French ownership. The agreement, made with French investment firm Acrotec, means that the company's jobs and digital TV know-how will remain rooted in French hands, much to the relief of employees and industry stakeholders.\nLagardere Electronics, which specializes in the development and production of digital TV decoders and other electronics devices, has been owned by the Lagardere group since 2006. However, in recent years the company has faced increasing financial pressure, prompting rumors that it would be sold-off.\n\"We were deeply concerned about the future of our jobs and the state of the industry if Lagardere Electronics were to fall into foreign hands,\" said Francois Dupont, a representative of the company's employee union. \"But with this deal, we can all breathe a sigh of relief. This is a win for us - and a win for France.\"\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Acrotec will acquire a majority stake in Lagardere Electronics, while the Lagardere group will retain a 25% stake and a seat on the company's board of directors. This allows Lagardere to maintain a measure of control over the company's direction, while freeing it from the financial burden of operating a struggling subsidiary.\n\"This deal is a positive outcome for all parties involved,\" said Arnaud Lagardere, CEO of the Lagardere group. \"We are able to refocus our resources on our core businesses, while ensuring the continued growth of Lagardere Electronics under French ownership.\"\nMany in the industry see the deal as a boost to France's position in the highly competitive electronics market. Lagardere Electronics has a strong reputation for expertise in digital TV technologies, and the agreement means that this knowledge will remain within France.\n\"This is a significant development for the French electronics industry,\" said Marie-Claire Balmes, a spokesperson for the French Electronics Federation. \"Lagardere Electronics is a major player in the sector, and keeping this expertise within French hands is essential for the long-term growth of the industry.\"\nThe deal is also seen as a positive sign for the French economy as a whole, which has been struggling in recent years to maintain competitiveness against other European countries.\n\"We are pleased to see the continued commitment of investors to the French market,\" said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission. \"This deal is yet another example of the strength of French industry, and we hope to see more investments of this kind in the future.\"\nAs news of the deal spread, many employees at Lagardere Electronics expressed their gratitude for the security it will provide. Antoine Blanc, an engineer at the company, said, \"I've been with Lagardere for 10 years, and I was worried about what the future held for my colleagues and me. But this deal is excellent news. We can now look forward to continuing our work with the knowledge that our jobs are secure.\"\nThe agreement is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks, pending approval from French regulators. Once completed, Lagardere Electronics will be well-positioned to continue its growth as a major player in the French electronics industry \u2013 a welcome relief in difficult times.", "MCI Communications Corp., a leading telecommunications provider, has entered into a 10-year agreement with NextWave Telecom Inc. which will enable it to compete with the top tier of U.S. wireless providers. The deal will see MCI leasing NextWave's extensive wireless spectrum holdings, enabling it to offer high-speed wireless services to its customers. The move is viewed as a significant step for MCI as it attempts to broaden its reach in the telecommunications industry.\n\"This deal is a game-changer for MCI,\" said the company's CEO, Fred Briggs. \"We are now in the same league as the big players in the wireless industry, and we're excited to be able to offer our customers a broader range of services.\"\nNextWave has been an important player in the wireless spectrum market, having acquired significant holdings during auctions held by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in recent years. The company's spectrum holdings include frequencies that are well-suited for wireless data services, making it an attractive partner for MCI.\nUnder the terms of the deal, NextWave will lease its spectrum to MCI for 10 years, with MCI assuming responsibility for all related costs, including deployment and maintenance of wireless infrastructure. The arrangement will enable MCI to extend its network infrastructure to provide high-speed wireless services to customers in markets where it currently does not have a presence in the wireless market.\nMCI's entry into the wireless market is well-timed given the increasing demand for wireless data services. The proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices has led to a surge in data usage, with customers demanding faster speeds and higher quality services. With the NextWave deal, MCI is positioning itself to meet the demand for high-speed wireless services while expanding its core business offerings.\nThe addition of wireless services also presents MCI with the opportunity to bundle multiple services into a single package for its customers, a strategy that has proven successful for other major telecom providers in the U.S. The company's core business already includes voice and data services, and the addition of wireless services will enable it to offer a complete portfolio of telecommunications services to customers.\nThe announcement of the NextWave deal has been well-received by industry analysts, who view it as a smart move for MCI. \"This is a bold move for MCI, and it's one that's likely to pay off in the long run,\" said Roger Entner, an industry analyst with Recon Analytics. \"By adding wireless services to its portfolio, MCI is positioning itself for growth and diversifying its revenue streams at the same time.\"\nThe deal with NextWave also comes at a time when the U.S. wireless market is undergoing significant consolidation. Major players in the industry, such as T-Mobile and Sprint, have recently announced plans to merge, reducing competition in the market. The addition of MCI to the mix will help to maintain some level of competition while offering customers a new option for their wireless needs.\nThe agreement with NextWave is expected to take effect in the first quarter of next year, pending approval from the FCC. In the meantime, MCI will begin making plans for the deployment of wireless infrastructure to support its new wireless services. The company plans to offer a range of wireless data services, including high-speed internet, video streaming, and mobile connectivity.\nWith the NextWave deal, MCI is poised to enter a new phase of growth and expansion in the telecommunications industry. By adding wireless services to its portfolio, the company is taking a strategic step forward that will enable it to compete with the biggest names in the wireless market. The deal is a sign of MCI's confidence in its ability to succeed in a highly competitive industry, and a clear signal that it intends to play a major role in the future of telecommunications in the U.S.", "Cupertino, California - Apple has finally announced its newest addition to the PowerBook family with the much-awaited built-in CD-ROM drive and a bigger screen.

While the deposit has brought much-needed economic growth to the region, it has also caused significant environmental concerns and strained relationships between the Indigenous community and mining companies.\nThe Voisey's Bay deposit was discovered in 1993, and after much exploration, became one of the largest nickel and copper mines in the world. The deposit is located in the traditional territory of the Innu Nation, whose members have lived in the region for thousands of years.\nInitially, the discovery of the deposit brought hope and promise to the Innu Nation. The mining company, Vale, promised jobs, training opportunities, and economic growth for the community. However, as the mine began operations, tensions began to rise.\nThe Innu Nation has raised concerns about the environmental impact of the mine on the land, water, and wildlife in the region. They have also expressed concerns about the lack of consultation and involvement in the mine's operations and decision-making processes.\nIn 2014, the Innu Nation filed a lawsuit against Vale and the government of Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming that they were not properly consulted before the mine was developed, and that their constitutional rights had been violated. The lawsuit also claimed that the mine was causing significant harm to the environment and the traditional way of life of the Innu people.\nThe lawsuit was settled in 2018, with Vale agreeing to provide $2.5 million in funding for Indigenous education and cultural initiatives, and $1 million annually for 10 years to support Innu-led environmental monitoring and conservation efforts.\nDespite the settlement, tensions between the Innu Nation and the mining company continue to persist. In 2019, Vale announced plans to expand the mine, which the Innu Nation, as well as environmental groups, have criticized as posing an even greater risk to the environment and Indigenous land rights.\nHowever, the mine has also brought significant economic benefits to the region. The mine employs nearly 500 people, and supports thousands of indirect jobs in the region. The Innu Nation has also received royalties and other benefits from the mine, which have contributed to the community's economic development and self-sufficiency.\nDespite the economic benefits, many members of the Innu Nation feel that their rights and concerns are being ignored and that the environmental risks of the mine outweigh the benefits. In a statement, Gregory Rich, Chief of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation said, \"We need to find a way to balance economic development with the need to protect our environment and our community. We cannot continue to prioritize profits over people.\"\nThe Voisey's Bay deposit is just one example of the complex issues that arise from resource development in Indigenous territories. Mining and other resource extraction industries can bring much-needed economic growth and job opportunities to Indigenous communities, but they can also cause significant harm to the environment and strain relationships between Indigenous communities and industry.\nMoving forward, it is crucial that mining companies and governments engage in meaningful consultations with Indigenous communities before developing resource extraction projects. This includes listening to concerns and prioritizing the protection of Indigenous land rights and the environment. Only through genuine collaboration and respect can we achieve a balance between economic growth and sustainable development.", "Scottish Amicable, a UK-based life insurance company, has reportedly turned down a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Abbey National, a British multinational banking and financial services firm.\nThe proposed deal would have seen Abbey National acquire Scottish Amicable, which has been operating as a standalone subsidiary of Royal London Group since 2014.\nScottish Amicable was founded in 1826 and is headquartered in Edinburgh. The company offers a range of life insurance, pensions, and investment products to customers in the UK and internationally.\nAccording to sources, Abbey National approached Scottish Amicable with an unsolicited bid in October 2021. The offer valued the insurance company at approximately $2.3 billion, representing a significant premium to its current market value.\nHowever, Scottish Amicable\u2019s board of directors reportedly rejected the offer on the grounds that it did not accurately reflect the company\u2019s true worth.\nIn a statement on the matter, Scottish Amicable CEO Barry O\u2019Dwyer said: \u201cWe have a clear vision for our business and are confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our customers and shareholders. The offer from Abbey National did not meet our expectations in terms of value, and we therefore declined it.\u201d\nO\u2019Dwyer added that Scottish Amicable\u2019s board had carefully considered the offer and consulted with its financial advisers before making its decision.\nThe news of the rejected bid has caused speculation about the future direction of both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National.\nSome analysts have suggested that Abbey National\u2019s interest in Scottish Amicable may have been driven by a desire to diversify its revenue streams and expand its product offering.\nHowever, others have suggested that the proposed deal may have been primarily motivated by a desire to gain access to Scottish Amicable\u2019s large customer base and distribution channels.\nAbbey National has not yet commented on the matter, although it is understood that the company is considering its options for how best to proceed.\nThe news comes at a challenging time for the insurance industry, which has been grappling with a range of issues including increasing costs, regulatory changes, and shifts in consumer behaviour.\nDespite these challenges, Scottish Amicable has remained focused on delivering strong financial results and expanding its customer base.\nIn its most recent financial report, the company reported a 14% increase in new business sales over the previous quarter, driven by strong demand for its life insurance and pension products.\nThe report also noted that Scottish Amicable had taken steps to streamline its operations and reduce costs, which had contributed to a significant improvement in its operating margin.\nThe news of the rejected bid has been met with mixed reactions from Scottish Amicable shareholders.\nSome have expressed disappointment that the company is not willing to consider a takeover offer that would have delivered a substantial return on their investment.\nOthers, however, have praised Scottish Amicable\u2019s decision to reject the offer, arguing that the company is in a strong position and does not need to sell itself to a larger firm in order to continue growing and delivering value to shareholders.\nThe situation is likely to remain unclear for some time, as both Scottish Amicable and Abbey National consider their next move.\nFor now, Scottish Amicable shareholders can take comfort in the fact that their company is committed to delivering long-term value and remains focused on delivering strong financial performance in a challenging business environment.", "The ongoing strike at General Motors (GM) plants in Canada is now affecting the company's operations in the United States. As a result of the strike, GM has decided to halt production at its U.S. factories, leading to the delay of new vehicle models.\nSince September 17, over 17,000 employees at GM's plants in Ontario, Canada, have been on strike. The workers are demanding better job security, higher wages, and improved health benefits. Negotiations between GM and the Canadian labor union, Unifor, have yet to reach a resolution.\nThe strike has disrupted GM's supply chain, especially for parts that are needed to manufacture vehicles. Consequently, the company has decided to temporarily shut down a plant in Tennessee and two facilities in Mexico. GM's factories in Michigan and Indiana will also be impacted by the strike.\nIn addition, GM has informed its workers in the U.S. that the launch of its new vehicles will be postponed due to the supply chain disruptions. This means that customers might have to wait longer than expected for some of GM's highly anticipated models, including the Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV and the new Chevrolet Camaro.\n\"This is a challenging situation for us and our employees in both countries,\" said a spokesperson for GM. \"We are committed to working with our suppliers and union partners to find a resolution as soon as possible.\"\nThe impact of the strike is not limited to GM and its workers. Local economies that rely on income from the plant, such as small businesses and suppliers, will also suffer. For example, the Canadian town of Ingersoll, where one of GM's facilities is located, anticipates a loss of $5 million in revenue for every week the strike continues.\nDespite the negative effects, Unifor President Jerry Dias has said that the union will not back down until their demands are met. \"We are holding out for a fair deal that provides job security and respects the work of our members,\" he said in a statement.\nThe strike at GM is just one example of the ongoing labor disputes in the automotive industry. In recent weeks, several other companies, including Ford, have faced protests and strikes from their employees who are demanding better pay and working conditions.\nFor instance, over 3,000 workers at a Ford factory near Detroit recently voted to go on strike in protest of the company's decision to shift production to Mexico. The workers, who are represented by the United Auto Workers union, are also calling for increased job security and a pay raise.\nLabor disputes in the automotive industry have become more prevalent in recent years as companies seek to cut costs and increase profits. Workers, on the other hand, are looking to protect their jobs and fair wages in an increasingly competitive and uncertain economy.\nThe strike at GM's Canadian plants has now spilled over into the United States, causing a ripple effect across the company's supply chain. It remains to be seen how long the strike will last and what the final outcome will be, but the situation is certainly unsettling for all those involved.\nIn the meantime, customers will have to wait for the launch of GM's new models, while workers and local communities face the economic consequences of the strike. The situation serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of the automotive industry and the importance of fair labor practices for all those involved.", "Prague, Czech Republic - The head of the Czech Republic's largest bank, Zdenek Turek, has announced his candidacy for a Senate seat in the upcoming elections. With a mission to clean up the post-communist banking sector, Turek believes he can make a positive impact from his new position.\nTurek, who currently serves as CEO of Ceska Sporitelna, has been a prominent figure in the country's banking sector for over 20 years. He has also been a vocal advocate for changes in the industry, including the implementation of stricter regulations and the promotion of ethical practices.\nIn his race for a Senate seat, Turek has pledged to prioritize issues related to the banking sector, including transparency, consumer protection, and the prevention of money laundering. He has also expressed his commitment to improving the overall economic climate in the country.\n\"Tackling corruption in the banking sector is crucial for our economy to thrive,\" Turek said in a recent interview. \"I believe that by working from within the Senate, I can make a real difference in ensuring that our financial institutions operate with integrity and accountability.\"\nThe Czech Republic's banking sector has faced significant scrutiny in recent years, with allegations of money laundering and other unethical practices by some of the country's largest financial institutions. In 2019, several high-profile figures were arrested in connection with an alleged \u20ac1 billion fraud scheme involving CZK Bank, one of the country's largest banks.\nTurek has been a vocal critic of such practices and has championed initiatives aimed at curbing unethical behavior in the banking sector. Earlier this year, Ceska Sporitelna launched a new code of ethics aimed at promoting transparency and responsible practices within the institution. The code includes provisions related to anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and environmental responsibility.\nMany in the country's financial sector have expressed support for Turek's candidacy, citing his reputation as a reform-minded leader and his deep understanding of the industry. Others, however, have expressed skepticism that one person can make a meaningful impact from within the Senate.\n\"I think it's great that someone with Turek's experience and expertise is running for office,\" said Karel Kucera, head of the Czech Banking Association. \"But realistically, I think there are limits to what he can achieve from within the Senate. Many of the biggest issues facing the banking sector will require broader structural reforms that can only be achieved through collaboration with other sectors and government agencies.\"\nDespite such concerns, Turek remains optimistic about his chances of making a difference. He has pledged to work closely with other officials and stakeholders to advance his goals and believes that his experience in the banking sector can be a valuable asset in shaping policy.\n\"If we want to make lasting changes to the banking sector, we need leaders who truly understand the challenges and opportunities facing the industry,\" Turek said. \"I believe that by working collaboratively and drawing on my own experience, we can make significant progress in promoting more responsible and sustainable banking practices.\"\nThe upcoming Senate elections are set to take place in October, with Turek's candidacy drawing significant attention from both the public and the political spheres. As interest in the race continues to grow, many are watching closely to see whether Turek can make good on his promises to clean up the banking sector and promote economic growth and stability in the country.", "The head of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business, John Doherty, has resigned from his position amid a cost-cutting dispute with the company. The sudden resignation, which was announced on Monday, has sent shock waves through the industry, leaving many wondering what the future holds for the aerospace giant.\nDoherty had been leading the company's efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency in the face of increasing competition from other aerospace companies. However, his plans were met with resistance from some senior executives who were concerned that the cost-cutting measures would harm the company's long-term prospects.\nAccording to sources within the company, Doherty had proposed a number of cost-saving measures, including a reduction in workforce and a restructuring of the company's operations. However, these proposals were met with resistance from some senior executives who were concerned about their impact on the company's bottom line.\nFollowing a series of heated discussions, Doherty decided to tender his resignation, saying that he could no longer work in an environment where his proposals were not being taken seriously.\nIn a statement announcing his resignation, Doherty said, \"I am proud of the work that we have done at McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business over the past few years. However, it has become clear to me that some of my proposals are not being embraced by all members of the senior executive team. As a result, I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company for me to step down.\"\nDoherty's departure has left many employees and industry analysts wondering what the future holds for the struggling aerospace giant. With increasing competition from other companies and a difficult economic climate, McDonnell Douglas will need to move quickly to find a replacement for Doherty and chart a new course for the company.\nIn the meantime, the company's senior executive team will take over Doherty's responsibilities until a replacement can be found. The search for a new head of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Business is expected to begin in the coming weeks.", "Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer of cocoa, is facing a prolonged dry spell that could negatively impact cocoa pod setting and the main crop growth. The dry spell which began in early April has continued to persist, raising concerns among cocoa farmers in the West African country.\nAccording to cocoa experts, the extended period of dry weather would likely impact pod development and subsequently reduce yields in the coming months. Farmers are already reporting that cocoa trees are showing signs of stress, including wilting leaves and non-flowering pods.\nFurthermore, the prolonged dry spell could have a significant impact on the country's main crop, which is due for harvest later this year. If the dry weather continues, it could lead to a smaller than expected crop, resulting in a significant drop in cocoa export revenues for Ivory Coast.\nLocal authorities have already taken measures to address the situation by providing farmers with water tanks and establishing watering stations in affected regions. However, these efforts may not be enough to prevent a significant drop in yields.\nCocoa production is critical to Ivory Coast's economy, accounting for over 40% of the country's total exports and employing over 5 million people, directly and indirectly. Any significant decline in cocoa production would have a significant impact on national income and employment.\nThe situation in Ivory Coast comes amid growing concern about climate change, which in recent years, has led to more frequent and intense weather events, including droughts, floods and wildfires. The impact of climate change on agriculture is particularly concerning, given the reliance of many developing countries on cash crops such as cocoa for their livelihoods.\nExperts have warned that if the weather patterns continue to shift, countries such as Ivory Coast may face continued declines in production, increased pest attacks, loss of land, and long-term vulnerability to food and livelihood insecurity.\nThe Ivory Coast government has been taking measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on cocoa production, including developing new drought-resistant seed varieties, irrigation systems, and other climate-smart farming practices. However, more needs to be done to manage these challenges effectively.\nThe government has also partnered with international institutions such as the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the World Bank Group to implement climate change adaptation measures and strengthen the resilience of rural livelihoods.\nIn conclusion, the prolonged dry spell in Ivory Coast has raised concerns about a decline in cocoa production this year, which could have implications for the country's economic growth and poverty reduction efforts. Addressing climate change and its impacts on agriculture must be a priority for the government, cocoa stakeholders, and the international community to ensure long-term sustainability of cocoa production and rural livelihoods.", "As BSkyB continues to expand its reach throughout Europe, the company is now reportedly considering further investments in Germany. According to recent reports, this move comes as the company experiences both a rise in profits and subscriber numbers across its various platforms.\nBSkyB has been operating in Germany for the past few years, where it has focused on providing satellite television services to customers throughout the country. This move has proven to be quite successful for the company, as it has steadily increased its subscriber base and revenue in the region.\nNow, with the company's recent financial success, BSkyB is reportedly looking to expand its operations in the country. According to sources close to the situation, the company is considering investing in additional infrastructure across Germany in order to better serve its growing customer base.\nThis could include the construction of new satellite dishes, the expansion of existing infrastructure, or the creation of new services tailored specifically to the German market. Regardless of the specific approach, it is clear that BSkyB is committed to building a strong presence in the country moving forward.\nOf course, this move is not surprising given the recent success of the company's operations in Germany. In a recent financial report, BSkyB announced that its German operations saw a 10% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the company reported that its subscriber base in the country now stands at over 5 million - a significant increase from just a few years ago.\nThese figures are no doubt encouraging for BSkyB as it looks to continue its growth trajectory in the region. With a strong foothold in Germany already established, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on its success and further expand its operations in the country.\nOf course, there are still potential challenges ahead for the company. For one, competition in the German market remains fierce, with a number of other satellite providers vying for customers' attention. However, with its reputation for quality service and a commitment to innovation, BSkyB is well-equipped to take on these challenges.\nMoreover, the company's recent investments in technology and infrastructure have helped it stay ahead of the curve in terms of delivering reliable and high-quality services to customers.

That's why we're confident we can continue to grow and succeed in Germany and beyond.\"\nOverall, it seems that BSkyB is continuing to make all the right moves as it looks to build a strong presence throughout Europe. With rising profits and subscriber numbers in Germany, the company has reason to be optimistic about its future prospects in the region. And with a renewed commitment to innovation and customer service, BSkyB is poised to continue delivering high-quality services to customers across the continent.", "Foster's Brewing Group, the Australian beer giant, is reportedly exploring joint venture opportunities in India and Vietnam as part of its expansion strategy for the Asian market.\nAccording to industry insiders, the move comes as the company seeks to capitalize on rising demand for premium and craft beers in the region. The joint ventures are expected to enable Foster's to establish a foothold in the Indian and Vietnamese markets, and gain access to a sizable consumer base.\nSources suggest that Foster's is currently in talks with a number of local beer makers and distributors in both India and Vietnam, and is reportedly close to finalizing a deal in Vietnam.\nThe company's move into the Indian market comes at a time when the country's rapidly growing middle class is becoming increasingly interested in premium and imported beers. Foster's is expected to launch a range of premium beers specifically targeted at the Indian market, and is said to be investing heavily in marketing and distribution efforts.\nVietnam, on the other hand, is an established beer market with a strong domestic industry. However, the country has seen a growing trend towards imported craft beers in recent years, presenting an opportunity for Foster's to establish a presence in the market.\nFoster's Brewing Group, which was acquired by Japanese drinks company Asahi in 2020 for $11 billion, is one of the world's leading brewers, with a portfolio of over 200 brands including Carlton Draught, VB, and Peroni. The company has a strong presence in Australia, Asia, and Europe, and has been looking to expand its operations in emerging markets in recent years.\nCommenting on the potential joint ventures, a spokesperson for Foster's said: \"We are always looking for opportunities to expand our business and reach new markets. India and Vietnam are both exciting markets with significant potential, and we believe our premium and craft beers have an excellent opportunity to succeed in these markets.\"\nThe spokesperson added that the company was \"committed to investing in the long-term growth and success of our business, and we will continue to explore opportunities that align with our strategic priorities.\"\nWhile the joint ventures are still in the early stages of negotiation, industry experts believe that Foster's entry into the Indian and Vietnamese markets could have a significant impact on the regional beer industry, and could potentially pave the way for further expansion in the Asian market.", "Hong Kong's former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping magnate, could be set to return to power after leading the city in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Rumours are swirling that Tung, who was handpicked by Beijing to lead the city of seven million, could return to politics as the next leader of the Special Administrative Region in 2022.\nTung's candidacy would be a significant move for Beijing, which has been grappling with a five-month-long pro-democracy protest movement in the city. Tung, who has Beijing's backing, is best known for his tough stance on dissent and anti-government sentiment, which would likely strike a chord with China's leaders.\nHowever, Tung's road back to power will not be easy. Despite being a successful businessman, he also had to rebuild his reputation after his family's shipping company, Orient Overseas Container Line, faced bankruptcy in the late 1980s.\nTung, who was then the CEO of the company, had to navigate significant losses before finally turning the business around. His success in revitalising the company saw him gain the attention of the Hong Kong government, which appointed him as the city's Chief Executive in 1997.\nDuring his tenure as Chief Executive, Tung was criticised for his close relationship with Beijing and for his handling of political issues in Hong Kong. However, his firm leadership helped to steer the city through the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2008 financial crisis.\nTung's predecessor, Leung Chun-ying, has also been touted as a possible candidate for the next Chief Executive position. However, Leung is viewed by many as being too controversial, with his administration being blamed for fanning the flames of the current protest movement with its hard-line stance against anti-government demonstrators.\nIn contrast, Tung is seen as a more moderate figure who could help to ease tensions in Hong Kong. His pro-business background may also help to appease Beijing, which is currently in the midst of a trade war with the United States.\nHowever, Tung's main challenge will be to win over the people of Hong Kong, who have become increasingly disillusioned with the city's political establishment in recent years. Many Hong Kongers see their leaders as being out of touch with the city's needs and are calling for greater representation and democratic freedoms.\nWhile Tung may be viewed as a more moderate figure than Leung, his close ties to Beijing will be a source of concern for many Hong Kongers. The city's young people, in particular, have been at the forefront of the recent protests and are calling for greater autonomy from China.\nTung will also have to navigate the issue of the extradition bill, which sparked the current protest movement. The bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be tried in mainland China, was eventually withdrawn by the city's government. However, protesters are still calling for its complete withdrawal and for the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\nTung's return to power could be seen as a signal by Beijing that it is doubling down on its hardline approach to Hong Kong. However, Tung's pro-business credentials could also signal a shift in policy, with China looking to pour resources into Hong Kong to boost economic growth.\nRegardless of his precise policies, Tung's return to power would be a significant moment for Hong Kong. Whether he is able to reunite the city and repair its damaged relationship with China remains to be seen.", "The Prague Stock Exchange rebounded on Monday with significant gains from the financial sector shares. This surge in share gains comes after weeks of stunted stock market performance following the recent COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global economic downturn. \nAccording to market analysts, the rebound is a promising sign for the Czech Republic's overall economic recovery. The Prague Stock Exchange rose by 2.3% on Monday, buoyed by significant gains from the financial sector.

Lenders such as Raiffeisenbank are forecasting that the most significant global economic risks surrounding the pandemic are behind us, with a gradual recovery in the second quarter of 2021. Consequently, lending facilities are likely to expand, and businesses will once again be able to gain access to credit. \nExperts suggest that the recovery of the financial sector is an encouraging sign that the Czech Republic's overall economic stability will improve as well. The economy is likely to strengthen as vaccination rates increase and lockdowns are lifted, allowing businesses to gradually resume operations. Market experts also note that technology companies and electronics retailers have shown impressive resilience during the pandemic and may drive the economic growth in the upcoming weeks. \nThe pandemic outbreak had seriously impacted the global economic landscape, leading to reduced output and shrinking markets. Therefore, the strong recent performance of the Prague Stock Exchange is a significant relief for investors and market analysts. Market regulations have helped the market rebound, promote transparency, and build investor confidence in the market. The Prague Stock Exchange's favorable performance indicates an optimistic long-term outlook for the country, making it an attractive market for both retail and institutional investors.", "BP and Shanghai Petrochemical have announced their decision to invest in a $2.5 billion ethylene plant in China. The joint venture between two of the world's largest oil companies promises to bring significant benefits to China's petrochemical industry.\nBP will join forces with Shanghai's largest petrochemical company for the construction of this plant in Eastern China's Jiangsu province, which will produce one million tonnes of ethylene per year. The project aims to have a minimal environmental footprint and follow the highest safety standards. Its design envisages a smart and highly integrated plant that will use industry-leading technology to produce high-quality products.\nThe decision to invest in this new venture is a solid step towards BP's plans for decarbonization.

China's recent announcement of its 14th Five-Year Plan also highlights the priority placed on achieving a green transition.\nThe investment demonstrates BP's commitment to partnering with Chinese companies to create low-carbon opportunities that will benefit China and the wider world.

The investment in the plant will also contribute to the national and regional economy's long-term growth, creating increased opportunities for local communities in the surrounding area.\nThe partnership between BP and Shanghai Petrochemical highlights the importance of the private sector in achieving sustainable growth and development in the Chinese economy. The investment's sustainability and social responsibility aspects are an essential element of BP's business values, which prioritizes the creation of a common and inclusive future.\nThe plant's construction will begin in 2021, with operations expected to begin in 2024. BP and Shanghai Petrochemical's joint venture promises to be a model for future projects that prioritize sustainability and demonstrate the importance of partnership and collaboration in realizing a low-carbon future.", "General Motors has announced that it is to invest \u00a3300 million in its U.K. operations, creating hundreds of jobs in the process.

But in March 1997, the company's shares plunged when it was revealed that the Busang deposit was a fraud, consisting of virtually no gold at all.\nNow, almost 25 years after the scandal, Bre-X is once again drawing attention for its operations in Indonesia. The company, which was resurrected as a shell company in 2017, announced in 2019 that it had formed a joint venture with Indonesia's PT Gunung Fajar, which is owned by Tommy Suharto.\nThe news sparked concern among some investors and observers, given Tommy Suharto's controversial reputation. The son of Indonesia's late authoritarian leader, Suharto, Tommy was convicted in 2002 of ordering the murder of a Supreme Court judge and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was released in 2006 after serving less than half of his sentence and has since been involved in various business ventures.\nCritics of the Bre-X-PT Gunung Fajar partnership have pointed out that the deal raises questions about the due diligence conducted by Bre-X and the legality of the partnership, given Tommy Suharto's criminal record.\nBre-X, however, has remained tight-lipped on the matter. In response to inquiries from journalists, the company has issued only sparse statements, including one in August 2019 in which it said it was \"fully committed to working within all the applicable laws and regulations in Indonesia.\"\nThe lack of transparency from Bre-X has only fueled speculation about the nature of the partnership and the potential risks involved for investors.\nSome observers have noted that Bre-X's dealings in Indonesia are not the only cause for concern. The company's current CEO, David Walsh, was one of the central figures in the 1997 fraud scandal and was criticized at the time for failing to properly oversee the company's exploration efforts in Busang. And the company's recent resurrection as a shell company has also raised eyebrows, with some accusing it of attempting to wipe the slate clean and distance itself from its checkered past.\nDespite these concerns, Bre-X has continued to pursue its operations in Indonesia. In November 2019, the company announced that it had signed a deal with a third-party company to begin exploration work at its Busang project, which is located in the same region where the 1997 fraud occurred.\nThe company has also announced that it is raising funds to pursue its operations, including through the sale of shares. According to recent filings with Canadian regulators, the company has raised more than $9 million through the sale of shares since 2017.\nBre-X's silence on the issues surrounding its Indonesian partnership and its past track record has worried some observers, who are calling for greater transparency from the company.\nSpeaking to the Financial Post, John Godec, a mining investment advisor and former head of mining research at BMO Nesbitt Burns, said: \"Investors would like to see greater transparency from the company regarding its plans and its partnerships. The track record of both Bre-X and Tommy Suharto raises some red flags, and investors want to be sure that any risks associated with the company's operations are being properly disclosed and managed.\"\nAs Bre-X continues to pursue its operations in Indonesia, the company will likely face mounting pressure to address these concerns and provide greater transparency to investors. With the ghosts of its past still haunting it, the company will need to show that it can navigate the tricky terrain of the mining industry with greater care and responsibility in order to win back the trust of investors.", "Nestle SA, the Swiss multinational food and beverage company, has seen a spectacular surge in growth in China over the past few years, driven by changing consumer tastes and the establishment of new factories in the country.\nAccording to a recent report, Nestle SA's sales in China jumped by 22% in 2020, outpacing the overall growth rate of the country's food and beverage market. This remarkable growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rise of the middle class in China, changing consumer preferences, and Nestle's strategy of expanding its presence in lower-tier cities.\nOne of the key drivers of Nestle's success in China has been its ability to adapt its products to the preferences of Chinese consumers. For instance, the company has introduced new flavors and packaging for its popular KitKat chocolate bars, such as green tea and strawberry flavors. It has also launched new products like the Starbucks-branded coffee and milk tea drinks, which have proven to be a hit among Chinese consumers.\nNestle has also been investing heavily in building new factories and expanding its operations in China. In September 2020, the company opened a new $100 million factory in Shandong province, which will produce a range of dairy products for Chinese consumers. This follows the opening of a new factory in Tianjin in 2019, which produces Nescafe coffee and is the largest coffee factory in Asia.\nIn addition to its factory expansion, Nestle has been working to expand its distribution network in China, particularly in lower-tier cities where there is significant untapped market potential. The company has been partnering with local retailers and e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and JD.com to reach more consumers across the country.\nOverall, Nestle's success in China is a testament to its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. With its continued investments in new factories and distribution channels, the company is well-positioned to maintain its momentum in the Chinese market for years to come.", "Sainsbury's, one of the UK's largest supermarket chains, has launched its own banking services in partnership with Bank of Scotland. The move comes as the supermarket looks to build on its existing financial services offering, and marks its entry into the competitive retail banking space. \nSainsbury's Bank will offer a range of products including personal loans, credit cards, and savings accounts, as well as insurance and mortgages. The supermarket has also pledged to offer competitive rates and rewards programmes to attract customers. \nSpeaking about the launch, Sainsbury's CEO Simon Roberts said: \"As a trusted brand with millions of customers across the UK, we are well-placed to offer banking services that meet their changing financial needs. We are excited to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, which shares our commitment to customer service and innovation.\" \nThe partnership with Bank of Scotland will see a range of banking services integrated into Sainsbury's stores, giving customers the convenience of being able to manage their banking and shopping in one place. Sainsbury's Bank will also offer digital banking and mobile app services. \nThe move into banking is a major strategic shift for Sainsbury's, which has been steadily expanding its financial services offering over the past decade. In 2013, the supermarket bought out Lloyds' stake in Sainsbury's Bank, giving it full control of the business. Since then, it has expanded into travel and pet insurance, as well as personal loans and credit cards. \nWith its new banking offering, Sainsbury's will compete with established banks such as Barclays, HSBC, and Lloyds. It will also face competition from other retailers, such as Tesco and M&S, which already have their own banking services. \nIndustry experts have praised Sainsbury's for being the first of the big four supermarkets to launch its own full-service bank. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: \"Sainsbury's is taking a smart, low-risk and potentially high-reward step into the retail banking space. Its established customer base gives it an advantage over other new entrants, and the partnership with Bank of Scotland should ensure a smooth launch.\" \nHowever, others have warned that Sainsbury's may struggle to compete with the big banks, which have much larger customer bases and more resources. David Watts, a banking consultant at McKinsey, said: \"Sainsbury's will need to offer something truly unique to entice customers away from the established banks. It will also need to invest heavily in customer service and technology to stay competitive.\" \nDespite the challenges, Sainsbury's is optimistic about the potential of its banking offering. According to a recent survey by the supermarket, nearly half of its customers said they would be interested in using its banking services. Sainsbury's Bank CEO Cathy Smith said: \"We believe there is a huge opportunity to expand our financial services offering and become a major player in the banking market. With our strong brand and the support of Bank of Scotland, we are confident of success.\" \nThe launch of Sainsbury's Bank represents a major milestone for the UK retail banking sector, which has seen increasing competition from non-traditional players in recent years. With its established customer base and innovative products, Sainsbury's looks set to shake up the market and give the big banks a run for their money.", "Food Lion, one of the largest grocery store chains in the country, has made a bold move to acquire Kash n\u2019 Karry in a deal worth $341 million.

Once completed, Kash n\u2019 Karry stores will be rebranded as Food Lion, and the two companies will combine operations.\nFood Lion\u2019s CEO, Kevin Holt, spoke to the media about the new acquisition, saying that the deal is a \"strategic decision\" for both companies. He highlighted that the acquisition will expand Food Lion's footprint in Florida, where Kash n\u2019 Karry has a significant presence. He added that the merger will also help Food Lion to enhance its supply chain and \u201cdeliver greater value and convenience\u201d to customers.\nThe acquisition of Kash n' Karry will give Food Lion access to the grocery chain\u2019s 49 stores located in Florida, which will add to the over 1,000 stores that the chain already operates across the East Coast. With this acquisition, Food Lion will now be able to better compete in the highly competitive grocery industry, where retailers continually look for ways to drive down prices.\nSome analysts have hailed the merger as a good move for Food Lion, as it will give them a competitive edge against rivals like Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon. Jamie Katz, an industry analyst at Morningstar, said that the acquisition will allow Food Lion to expand its reach in Florida, a state that is experiencing rapid population growth. She added that the changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic have made this acquisition more important, as shoppers demand convenience and speed.\nFor Kash n\u2019 Karry, the merger is an opportunity to join forces with an established brand with deeper pockets. Kash n\u2019 Karry has been struggling in recent years, as they try to keep up with the competition. Food Lion\u2019s acquisition will allow the chain to improve their offerings while also benefiting from their new partner\u2019s resources.\nThe two grocery chains have not yet discussed how the merger will affect their employees. However, experts suggest that redundancies are likely, and employees may face changes in their roles in the new merged companies.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Kash n\u2019 Karry by Food Lion in a deal worth $341 million is set to bring significant changes to the grocery industry in the Southeastern United States. The merger will help Food Lion expand its reach in Florida, improve its supply chain and allow it to better compete with rivals.

In recent months, domestic travel has picked up, with airlines adding more flights and introducing new destinations.\nHowever, with international travel still facing restrictions in many countries, Air China's expansion is aimed at capturing a larger share of the global market once travel resumes.\nAir China's announcement also comes at a time when many airlines around the world are struggling to stay afloat due to the ongoing pandemic. With its strong financial standing and expanding fleet, Air China is well positioned to weather the storm and emerge as a major player in the global aviation industry. \nAs airlines around the world continue to grapple with the impact of the pandemic, Air China's expansion plans are a sign of optimism for the future of the aviation industry. With increased connectivity and new services, the airline is poised to capture the growing demand for air travel once international borders reopen.", "Compaq Computer Corp. announced today that it had achieved a sharp rise in profit, with a 43% jump in the third quarter of the year, with sales boosting and streamlined operations. The result is seen as yet another milestone for the company in its remarkable turnaround since CEO Michael Capellas took over in early 2000.\nAccording to the report, the company's net income stood at $357 million, or 21 cents per share, compared with $249 million, or 15 cents per share, in the same quarter in 1999. This earnings performance also surprised Wall Street analysts, who had estimated earnings of only 15 cents per share.\n\"We feel great about our performance in the third quarter,\" Capellas said in a statement. \"We exceeded our financial objectives due to strong growth in key product areas and solid execution of our operational efficiency initiatives.\"\nSales for the quarter also grew by 22% to $10.14 billion compared with $8.32 billion in the same period last year. This jump was driven by strong revenue growth in the company's business computing, storage, and consumer products divisions. Compaq has worked hard to reduce its PC business as it looks to bolster other areas.\nIn recent years, Compaq had struggled to compete in the PC market, with stiff competition from Dell and Hewlett-Packard. But the company has now refocused on high-margin businesses, including servers, storage, and software, with considerable success.\nThe company's operational improvements have also helped boost its bottom line. Compaq has implemented a series of cost-cutting measures over the past year, such as plant closures, job cuts, and reductions in capital spending. These moves have allowed the company to achieve greater efficiency and stronger profitability.\nCompaq's PC sales, however, were stagnant, with sales even dropping slightly to $2.68 billion from $2.69 billion. The company has pointed to a slow PC market and significant competition in this space.\nDespite the challenges, Compaq's CEO remains optimistic about the company's prospects. \"We believe that our focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, along with our operational improvements, will result in continued profitability and shareholder value,\" Capellas said.\nThe earnings announcement is likely to give a boost to the company's stock. Compaq shares were down more than 50% earlier this year but have since rebounded, thanks in part to strong earnings reports.\nCompaq's success also comes amid a broader revival in the technology industry, which has long taken a beating due to concerns about overhyped valuations and a downturn in the American economy. But now, with the economy gradually rebounding, technology companies like Compaq are well positioned to profit.\nThe Compaq earnings report caps off a strong quarter for the technology industry. IBM, Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard have all recently reported strong earnings. Industry analysts suggest that this bodes well for the technology industry going forward and could signify the end of the technology industry's troubles.\nWith stronger revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a refocused business focus, Compaq Computer Corp. appears set for continued success in the months ahead. Investors and industry analysts alike will no doubt keep an eye on the company's progress as it continues its impressive turnaround story.", "As China prepares to take full control of Hong Kong, Britain has proposed a set of laws concerning subversion in the once independent city. The new laws are aimed at protecting the rights of Hong Kong citizens, many of whom are fearful of Chinese rule, and maintaining the autonomy of the region.\nUnder the proposed laws, any individual or organization found guilty of subversion would face punishment including fines and imprisonment. The laws would also target foreign interference in Hong Kong's internal affairs, a concern shared by many in the region.\nThe proposed laws come in response to increasing Chinese influence in the city. In recent years, Beijing has cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, with pro-independence activists facing arrest and imprisonment. The new laws proposed by Britain aim to counter this trend and safeguard the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nThe proposed laws have been met with mixed reactions. Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have welcomed the move, with many calling it a step in the right direction for the protection of human rights in the city. Others, however, have voiced concerns over the potential for the laws to be used to suppress dissent in the region.\nSupporters of the proposed laws argue that they are necessary to counter Chinese influence in the region and protect the rights of Hong Kong citizens. They argue that the laws will give Hong Kong a greater degree of autonomy and independence, and will help to maintain its status as a global financial hub.\nHowever, opponents of the proposed laws argue that they will do little to protect human rights in the region. They argue that the laws are more about posturing and protecting British interests in the region than they are about protecting the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nDespite the mixed reactions to the proposed laws, it is clear that the issue of Hong Kong's autonomy and independence is one that will continue to generate debate and controversy in the coming years. As China's influence in the region continues to grow, the question of how to maintain Hong Kong's autonomy and independence will become increasingly pressing.\nThe proposed laws come at a time when tensions between the UK and China are already high. In recent months, the two countries have clashed over issues such as the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China, and the presence of Huawei in the UK's 5G network.\nThe proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong are likely to further strain relations between the two countries, with China already warning of unspecified \"countermeasures\" if the laws are passed.\nThe situation in Hong Kong is complex, and it is unclear what the future holds for the city. With China set to take full control of the region, many are left wondering whether Hong Kong's autonomy and independence will survive.\nFor the time being, however, Britain's proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong offer a glimmer of hope for those who believe in the importance of human rights and democracy in the region. While they may not be a perfect solution to the problem of Chinese influence in Hong Kong, they represent a step in the right direction for the protection of the rights of Hong Kong citizens.\nAs the debate over Hong Kong's autonomy and independence continues, it is clear that the world will be watching closely to see how events unfold. For now, however, the proposed laws on subversion in Hong Kong offer a glimpse of hope for those who believe in the importance of human rights and democracy in the region.", "In a move that comes as welcome news for American poultry exporters, China has announced a delay in the planned ban on U.S. poultry imports. The ban, which was supposed to take effect on January 1, 2021, has been postponed by an unspecified period to allow for further discussions on quarantine protocols.\nChina's decision to delay the ban follows a request from U.S. trade officials who have been pressing their Chinese counterparts to reconsider the move. American industry groups have been lobbying aggressively against the ban, arguing that it would create severe economic hardship for U.S. poultry farmers and exporters.\nChina imposed the ban in response to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in South Carolina, which prompted the Chinese government to suspend imports from the state. However, the U.S. government and industry groups have argued that the ban is unscientific and unfair, as other countries have not imposed similar measures.\nThe U.S. government has been pushing for a resolution to the issue, and President Trump reportedly raised the matter during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit last month. The two countries have agreed to continue discussions on the issue, with a view to reaching a resolution that is satisfactory to both sides.\nIn a statement, China's General Administration of Customs (GAC) said that it would \"continue to communicate with the U.S. side on quarantine requirements for imported poultry\" and urged the U.S. to \"take effective measures to prevent the spread of HPAI.\"\nThe U.S. poultry industry has welcomed the news of the delay, but expressed concern that the issue has yet to be resolved. Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council, said that while the delay was good news, it was \"critical\" that progress was made in resolving the issue.\n\"We are pleased that the Chinese government has recognized the importance and complexity of this issue and the need for further discussions,\" Sumner said in a statement. \"However, time is running out, and we urge both governments to work together to reach a resolution that allows for the continued trade of U.S. poultry with China.\"\nThe U.S. is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of poultry, with exports valued at around $5 billion annually. China is one of the largest markets for U.S. poultry, with shipments estimated at $500 million in 2019.\nIf the ban were to go ahead, it would be a significant blow to the U.S. poultry industry, which is already grappling with the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay in the ban gives both sides more time to resolve the issue, but industry groups remain concerned that a final resolution may not be reached in time.", "In a sharp call for increased transparency in Chinese listed companies, a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official has urged China to adopt more open reporting practices, raising concerns over inadequate disclosure standards and the risks to foreign investors.\nEchoing the concerns of many investors, Paul Hastings, director of the SEC\u2019s Office of International Affairs, said that high-quality disclosure is particularly crucial for those investing across borders and this is something still lacking in many Chinese firms.\nAddressing a conference in Beijing, Hastings urged China to adopt international standards, asserting that trustworthy financial information is fundamental to creating a sustainable and healthy capital market.\nHe expressed his concerns about the lack of transparency, requesting that China take a disciplined approach towards their financial disclosure practices, especially for cross-border investors who are particularly reliant on the accuracy of public information.\nFor years, the US has tried to get China to agree to its own demands for more transparency. However, Hastings\u2019s call for China to adopt international standards is the latest sign of tension concerning one of the most contentious issues in the economic relationship between the US and China.\nThere has long been criticism among Western investors that Chinese public companies have opaque and inadequate accounting practices, which translates into a real risk for investors looking to do business in China.\nMany have also expressed their concerns about the number of Chinese companies that are listed on US stock exchanges, pointing out that these companies may not be trustworthy in their reporting practices. This has led to increased interest in better regulation and oversight of Chinese investment.\nBut Hastings\u2019s comments come at a time of heightened tension between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trading practices and has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese goods.\nThe US President has also issued executive orders aimed at limiting the amount of securities investments Chinese companies can make in US companies, which has fueled concern among international investors about the potential impact of this tension on foreign investment in China.\nHowever, Hastings emphasized the importance of transparency in global capital markets, urging China to adopt international standards and best practices. This, he said, would help build trust with investors and create a sustainable environment for cross-border investments, which is essential for the continued growth of the global economy.", "KPMG, one of the world's largest professional services firms, is on track for revenue growth thanks to its investment in infrastructure and technology, according to the firm's chairman, Bill Thomas.\nThomas spoke to reporters at the firm's annual results briefing in London on Wednesday, announcing that KPMG's revenue had increased by 3.7% to \u00a32.3bn in the UK last year.\nHe attributed the growth to the firm's investment in new technologies and infrastructure, which he said had helped to drive efficiencies and improve client services.\n\"Our investment in technology and infrastructure has enabled us to modernise our business and build deeper relationships with our clients,\" Thomas said. \"We're seeing the benefits of this in our revenue growth and our ability to deliver more value to our clients.\"\nKPMG has been investing heavily in new technologies in recent years, including artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics, which the firm says are helping it to deliver more innovative and efficient services to its clients.\nThe firm has also been investing in infrastructure to support its growing business, including a new office in London's Canary Wharf and a new data centre in Bristol.\nThomas said that the investments were starting to pay off, with the firm seeing strong growth in a number of key areas, including audit and advisory services, as well as tax and financial reporting.\nThe firm's success has also been bolstered by its focus on sustainability and corporate responsibility, which Thomas said had become increasingly important for clients and employees alike.\n\"We recognise the importance of sustainable business practices and the role that we can play in promoting them,\" he said. \"This is not only good for our clients and the environment, but it's also good for our business by attracting and retaining the best talent.\"\nDespite the positive results, Thomas acknowledged that the firm still faced challenges, including ongoing uncertainty over Brexit and the increasing regulatory pressures facing the accounting industry.\nHe called for greater clarity on Brexit and urged the government to provide more support for UK businesses to help them navigate the complexities of the UK's departure from the EU.\nHe also stressed the need for the accounting industry to maintain high standards and regain public trust, following a number of high-profile scandals that have undermined confidence in the sector.\n\"We recognise that we have a responsibility to rebuild public trust in our profession and to ensure that we maintain the highest ethical and professional standards,\" he said.\nOverall, however, Thomas was optimistic about KPMG's future prospects, saying that the firm remained committed to delivering innovative and efficient services to clients, and to investing in the technologies and infrastructure that would help to drive growth.\n\"We're confident that our investment in the future will continue to pay off, not just in terms of revenue growth but also in terms of our ability to make a positive impact on the world,\" he said. \"That's what our clients want, and that's what we're here to deliver.\"", "AMEC Plc, a leading engineering and project management company, is reportedly exploring a potential investment in French electrical and construction company Spie Batignolles. According to sources familiar with the matter, AMEC is considering buying a stake in Spie's electrical and construction businesses to expand its international exposure and diversify its portfolio.\nThe potential deal is said to be in its early stages, and neither company has publicly commented on the matter. However, industry insiders believe that a partnership between the two companies could be mutually beneficial, as AMEC's expertise in engineering and project management could complement Spie's existing capabilities and help the French company expand its reach in global markets.\nAMEC Plc, which is headquartered in London, has a strong track record of delivering major infrastructure projects around the world. The company operates in a range of sectors, including oil and gas, mining, power, and transportation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slowdown in several of these industries, making it increasingly important for AMEC to diversify its revenue streams and explore new opportunities for growth.\nSpie Batignolles, headquartered in Levallois-Perret, France, is a major player in the construction and electrical engineering industries. The company has a presence in several countries, including Belgium, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, and has a strong reputation for delivering complex and high-profile projects. In recent years, Spie has shifted its focus towards renewable energy and other environmentally-friendly technologies, in an effort to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly-changing industry.\nA potential investment in Spie Batignolles would allow AMEC to tap into the French company's expertise in these areas, while also gaining a foothold in the European market. The move could also help AMEC capitalize on the growing demand for renewable energy and other sustainable technologies, as governments around the world invest heavily in infrastructure that supports decarbonization.\nWhile the potential investment is still in its early stages, industry experts have expressed optimism about the possibilities it could create. If the two companies are able to successfully partner, they could create a powerful force in the global infrastructure sector, offering a wide range of engineering and project management services to clients around the world.", "Manchester United\u2019s shares have surged to record highs following rumors of a possible takeover bid by billionaire Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The news has created a buzz amongst investors, analysts and fans alike as they await confirmation of a potential $4 billion deal for the club.\nOn Monday morning, the shares of the club jumped by 5% to $18.30, the highest they have been since early 2018. This stock market rally followed news of fresh investment by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which has purchased a stake of around $1.5 billion in Manchester United.\nThe potential takeover could create a huge change for the club, who has struggled to regain the form and success they enjoyed in previous decades. With the new investment and support, Manchester United could much more easily chase after the best players and make transfers that will help improve their team.\nHowever, there is also the possibility that fans may protest the acquisition by the controversial Crown Prince, who has been accused of human rights abuses by several media outlets. Furthermore, investors are concerned about the potential backlash and criticisms that could arise from this takeover bid, especially in the wake of the recent Jamal Khashoggi scandal.\nDespite the controversies surrounding the Crown Prince, many analysts believe that the investment in Manchester United makes sound business sense. The club is one of the biggest and most successful in the world of football, with a large and passionate fan-base that stretches across the globe. This huge fan-base provides the club with strong revenues from ticket sales, merchandise, broadcasting rights, and sponsorship deals.\nMoreover, the club is situated in the lucrative English Premier League, which has grown to be one of the most lucrative football leagues in the world. Since the EPL\u2019s formation in 1992, it has become one of the wealthiest sports leagues, attracting significant amounts of investment and international attention.\nWhilst Manchester United has faced a slump in recent seasons, the club\u2019s competitive history means that they remain a popular team for fans and investors alike. Manchester United has won 20 Premier League trophies, more than any other team in the league, as well as three European cups and a FIFA Club World Cup.\nThe club is also renowned for its ability to command high transfer fees, with record-breaking deals such as the \u00a389 million purchase of Paul Pogba. The club has the resources and ambition to compete with the very best in the sport, and this is likely what has attracted the Saudi Arabian prince\u2019s interest.\nWith the potential takeover, there is a new sense of excitement and hope amongst Manchester United fans. Supporters of the team have long argued that the club has been mismanaged in recent years, with poor signings, frequent changes in management, and a lack of success.\nThe new investment would allow the club to rebuild and restore itself, and there is the potential for the club to experience a resurgence in form and success. This would undoubtedly please the millions of fans who support the club, wishing to see Manchester United return to the sustained success they enjoyed under Alex Ferguson, in particular when they won the famous \u201ctreble\u201d in 1999.\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the potential takeover, the surge in Manchester United\u2019s share prices indicates that investors are feeling optimistic. Whilst there is no guarantee that the deal will go through, the fact that the club is now attracting the interest of one of the world\u2019s richest men means that a new era could be on the horizon for the club.\nIn this sense, the rumors of the takeover bid have sparked positive headlines and new discussions around one of the biggest football clubs in the world. Manchester United\u2019s shareholders, fans, and football enthusiasts alike now eagerly await further developments in what is becoming one of the biggest takeover sagas in football history.", "In a significant move towards ensuring public health safety, the Chinese government has launched a national drive to test all blood products for HIV contamination. This initiative is expected to play a crucial role in reducing the number of HIV infections in the country.\nIn recent years, China has witnessed a steady rise in the number of people living with HIV. According to official figures released by the National Health Commission, China has an estimated 950,000 HIV-positive people, with the actual number of cases potentially being much higher, since many people may not have been tested. HIV is primarily spread through sexual contact, contaminated needles, and from mother to child during childbirth. Contaminated blood products are another significant source of HIV transmission.\nThe new initiative to test all blood products is aimed at strengthening the safeguards around the quality of the country's blood supply. The Chinese government has provided additional funding to blood centers and hospitals across the country to enable them to procure the necessary equipment and conduct the tests. The initiative is expected to take several months to complete, but the government has indicated its commitment to ensuring that all blood products used in the country are safe.\nThe move is also significant given China's historic struggles with contaminated blood products. In the 1990s, the country experienced a significant outbreak of HIV infections due to the widespread use of contaminated blood products. At the time, many blood centers were run by commercial enterprises that placed profits over health and safety. This led to a significant number of people being infected with HIV and hepatitis C.\nSince then, the government has made significant strides in improving the safety of the country's blood supply. However, the recent rise in HIV infections has prompted the authorities to take further action. The new initiative is expected to ensure that China's blood supply remains safe and free from contamination.\nThe move has been welcomed by health experts, who see it as a significant step towards reducing the number of people living with HIV in China. The initiative is expected to contribute to the country's efforts to meet the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS by 2030.\nIn conclusion, the Chinese government's decision to launch a national drive to test all blood products for HIV contamination is a significant step towards ensuring public health safety in the country. The initiative is expected to help reduce the number of new HIV infections and play a crucial role in China's efforts to end the epidemic of HIV/AIDS by 2030.", "The Hong Kong government has been working on new overflight arrangements with Beijing, ahead of the 1997 handover of the territory to China. A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said that the negotiations were still ongoing, but that the parties were making progress.\nThe negotiations are aimed at ensuring that the airlines of all countries can continue to use Hong Kong as an air traffic hub, even after the territory becomes part of China. Currently, Hong Kong is subject to international aviation regulations, and many airlines use the city as a convenient transfer point for flights between different countries.\nThe new arrangements would guarantee that airlines can continue to use Hong Kong as a transit point, without having to comply with new, potentially restrictive, regulations after the handover. The Hong Kong government has been keen to reassure the aviation industry and the travelling public that there will be no disruption to air services after 1997.\nObservers have noted that the negotiations are part of the wider process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. The territory is currently ruled by the British, but this will change on 1 July 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong is transferred to Beijing under the terms of a treaty signed in 1984. The treaty also guarantees that Hong Kong will retain many of its existing freedoms and rights under a system known as \"one country, two systems\".\nThe aviation negotiations are seen as an important step in ensuring that Hong Kong can maintain its position as a major economic and transportation hub in East Asia. The city is strategically located at the crossroads of major air routes between Asia and Europe, and many airlines use it as a hub for flights to other parts of Asia, Australia, and beyond.\nHong Kong is also home to one of the world's busiest container ports, and has a thriving financial sector. The territory's economy has grown rapidly in recent years, and is seen as a model of efficient, market-oriented development in Asia.\nThe aviation negotiations are just one part of the complex process of preparing Hong Kong for its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. Nevertheless, they are seen as an important symbol of the commitment of the Hong Kong government to maintaining the territory's position as a leading center for international trade, commerce, and finance in the region.", "Associated British Foods (ABF) has reported a 15% increase in profits in the past year, however, the chairman, Michael McLintock, has expressed caution about the year ahead due to political uncertainties surrounding Brexit.\nABF, which owns brands such as Twinings, Primark, and Kingsmill, reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.36bn for the year up until September 15, which represents an increase of \u00a3178m from last year. The company's revenue also increased by 1% to \u00a315.6bn.\nThe Profits were driven by the strong performance of Primark, which saw a rise in sales of 6%, boosting overall sales to \u00a37.8bn. ABF's grocery business also saw a 1% increase in sales to reach \u00a33.5bn, with Twinings and Ovaltine standing out as strong performers.\nHowever, in his statement, McLintock warned that the company faced challenges ahead, largely due to the ongoing political uncertainty surrounding Brexit. \"The UK\u2019s departure from the EU creates uncertainty,\" he said. \"The complexity and range of issues is daunting. Currently, significant uncertainty remains over the outcome and timing of a UK departure from the EU, and the nature of the future relationship.\"\nHe further highlighted the potential presence of trade barriers and tariff changes in the months to come and the fact that the UK and EU are yet to establish a trade agreement. McLintock added that the company is planning for all eventualities but admitted the situation is challenging.\nDespite the uncertainty, McLintock also spoke positively about the progress the company has made in the development of its sugar division. ABF is the largest sugar producer in Africa and has been investing heavily in the region in recent years. These investments are already starting to pay off, with revenue from the division increasing by 38% to \u00a31.93bn.\nThe company has also recently invested heavily in its agriculture business, including the development of new technologies for crop production, the introduction of new products such as animal feed, and the expansion of its global reach. Plans are underway for ABF to acquire 2,000 hectares of new farmland in China, while in Europe, the company has partnered with another firm to develop a grain terminal in the Port of Bar in Montenegro.\nWhile McLintock's warning is justified, some analysts believe the company is in a strong position to weather the political difficulties ahead. Analyst James Edwardes Jones from RBC Capital Markets said, \"ABF has got a well-diversified business with a lot of resilience, so even with the current political uncertainty, it's well-positioned.\"\nIndeed, ABF's success in recent years has been due in part to its diversified business model, which has allowed it to weather previous economic uncertainties, including the 2008 recession.\nOverall, ABF's strong financial results are a cause for optimism, but the chairman's caution highlights the challenges that lie ahead. As the political situation remains unpredictable, the company will need to remain vigilant and adaptable if it is to continue its upward trajectory.", "In what is shaping up to be one of the most significant shifts in the banking industry in recent memory, several major banks are jockeying for position in an emerging private banking super-league.\nIt's been no secret that private banking has been undergoing a significant transformation over the past few years, with the rise of new technology and changing customer expectations setting the stage for a potentially seismic shift.\nBut while many have predicted a gradual, decentralized evolution in the sector, recent reports suggest that some of the biggest names in banking are gearing up for a more aggressive approach.\nAccording to industry insiders, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup are among the banks that are currently in the process of retooling their private banking services in an effort to compete for a share of the market.\nAnd while each of these banks has unique strengths and weaknesses, they all share a common goal: to create a comprehensive, high-tech, and customer-centric private banking platform that can compete with the best in the business.\nFor JP Morgan, this means building on its existing strength in wealth management and expanding its offerings to better serve customers in emerging markets. The bank has already made significant investments in this area, with recent hires including former HSBC executive Joaquim Levy and former Goldman Sachs executive David Holstein.\nGoldman Sachs, meanwhile, is taking a more aggressive approach, launching a new arm dedicated to serving ultra-high-net-worth clients. Dubbed the \"Private Wealth Management Group,\" this division will focus on providing tailored investment advice and customized solutions to clients with at least $10 million in investable assets.\nFor Citigroup, the focus seems to be on expanding its reach in existing markets. The bank has recently made a number of strategic hires in Asia, including former Deutsche Bank executive Mary Kate Gulick, as it seeks to capture a larger share of the rapidly growing wealth in the region.\nBut regardless of the specific strategies employed by each bank, the overarching goal is clear: to stake a claim in what many experts believe could be the future of private banking.\nSo what does this mean for customers? For one thing, it could mean a more dynamic and competitive environment, with banks offering new and innovative services in an effort to attract and retain clients.\nBut it could also lead to a concentration of power in the hands of a few large players, potentially limiting choice and creating new risks for consumers.\nAs with any major shift in the financial industry, there are likely to be winners and losers. However, one thing is certain: the emerging private banking super-league is poised to play a major role in shaping the future of this critical sector, and those who are best able to adapt and innovate will be the ones that come out on top.", "California's high-tech industry has soared after a costly ballot proposal that would have severely impacted their businesses was defeated in the recent elections.\nThe ballot proposal, known as Proposition 22, aimed to classify workers in gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft as employees instead of independent contractors. This would have required these companies to offer benefits and protections such as health insurance, sick leave, and minimum wage to their workers.\nHowever, these companies argued that such a move would have drastically increased their costs, making it impossible for them to operate profitably. They spent millions of dollars campaigning against the proposal, arguing that it would lead to job losses and reduced services for consumers.\nThe proposition was fiercely debated, with both sides arguing passionately for their cause. In the end, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 58% to 42%.\nThe defeat of Proposition 22 has been a major boost for the high-tech industry in California. Companies that were facing the prospects of lower profits and uncertain futures are now seeing their stocks soar.\nUber and Lyft, for instance, saw their stocks rise by 11% and 14%, respectively, following the defeat of the proposal. Other gig economy companies such as DoorDash, Postmates, and Instacart are also experiencing significant gains.\nThis surge in stock prices shows that investors were relieved at the outcome of the vote. Many of these companies had threatened to leave California if the proposal had passed, causing concerns about their futures.\nThe CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, welcomed the defeat of the proposal, stating that it was a great day for drivers and riders. He praised the voters for understanding the importance of preserving the flexibility and independence of drivers who choose to work for these companies.\nSimilarly, John Zimmer, the co-founder of Lyft, stated that the defeat of Proposition 22 would allow their company to continue providing affordable, reliable transportation to millions of Californians.\nWhile the high-tech companies are celebrating, there are concerns among workers and labor unions about the impact of the defeat of the proposal.\nMany labor unions, which had supported the proposal, argued that drivers and delivery workers deserve better protections and benefits. They worry that these workers will continue to be exploited by these companies, which will not offer them the basic rights that they are entitled to as employees.\nIn a statement, the California Labor Federation stated that they were disappointed at the defeat of the proposal but would continue to fight for the rights of workers in the gig economy.\nDespite these concerns, the defeat of Proposition 22 is seen as a significant victory for the high-tech industry. It is likely to strengthen the position of these companies in the state and encourage them to invest more in their operations.\nIt also sends a message to other states and jurisdictions that may consider similar proposals in the future. The high-tech companies have shown that they are willing to spend millions of dollars to protect their interests, and that they have the ability to mobilize supporters to vote against such proposals.\nIn conclusion, the defeat of Proposition 22 is a significant win for California's high-tech industry. It allows these companies to continue operating as they have been, providing flexibility and independence to their drivers and delivery workers.\nWhile there may be concerns about the impact on workers, the outcome of the vote shows that the voice of the business community was heard loud and clear. The future of the gig economy in California is now more certain, and investors are confident that these companies will continue to deliver strong returns.", "The Czech government is facing a challenging decision on how to diversify its gas supplies in order to reduce its dependence on Russia. The situation has become critical in light of recent geopolitical tensions and the threat of potential gas supply disruptions.\nThe Czech Republic currently imports around two-thirds of its gas from Russia, making it highly reliant on a single source. This puts the country in a vulnerable position, particularly in light of Russia's history of using gas as a political weapon in its disputes with other European countries.\nIn addition, the Czech Republic is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its reliance on Russian gas and to increase energy security through diversification. The EU is looking to create a unified energy market and reduce its dependence on Russian gas in order to avoid being held hostage to political disputes between Russia and other European countries.\nThe Czech government has been considering various options for reducing its dependence on Russian gas. One possibility is to increase the country's natural gas production, which currently accounts for only a small percentage of overall demand. However, this would require significant investment and a long-term strategy.\nAnother option is to diversify imports by building new gas infrastructure, such as interconnectors with neighboring countries. This would allow the Czech Republic to tap into other gas sources, such as Norway, Azerbaijan, and the US. However, these projects are also expensive and require significant planning and coordination.\nThe Czech Republic is also exploring the possibility of importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from other countries. LNG is a form of natural gas that is cooled to a liquid state for easier transport and storage. It can be imported from anywhere in the world, providing greater flexibility and security.\nThe government has already taken some steps towards diversifying gas supplies. In 2019, it signed a deal with Poland to build a new gas pipeline between the two countries, which would allow the Czech Republic to access alternative gas supplies from the Baltic Sea region.\nThe Czech Republic has also been negotiating with the US and Qatar over potential LNG imports. In July 2020, the country signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar on energy cooperation, which includes the exploration of LNG imports. The Czech government has also announced plans to build an LNG terminal in the northern city of Decin, which would allow it to import LNG from various sources.\nHowever, these efforts have been met with resistance from Russia, which sees the diversification of gas supplies as a threat to its dominant position in the European gas market. In September 2019, a senior Russian official warned the Czech Republic against building an LNG terminal, stating that it would be a \"detrimental project\". Russian gas giant, Gazprom, has also been accused of using its dominant position in the Czech gas market to block competition.\nIn the face of these challenges, the Czech government must decide on a long-term strategy for reducing its dependence on Russian gas. This will require careful planning and coordination with other EU countries, as well as investment in new infrastructure and technologies.\nThe geopolitical situation in Europe is constantly evolving, and gas supply disruptions are a real threat. The Czech Republic must ensure that it is not held hostage to political disputes and that it can secure the energy it needs to power its economy. Diversifying gas supplies will be a challenging process, but it is essential for the energy security of the Czech Republic and the stability of the wider European energy market.", "The father of a Chinese dissident is protesting his son's innocence ahead of his trial, as he believes the charges against him are politically motivated.\nThe dissident, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested earlier this year on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\" after he wrote an article critical of the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He has been held in detention since then and is set to stand trial in the coming weeks.\nHowever, his father, who also cannot be named for fear of reprisals, has been speaking out in defense of his son. \"My son is innocent,\" he told reporters outside the courthouse where the trial is set to take place. \"He simply exercised his right to free speech and expressed his opinions. He is not a criminal.\"\nThe father has also accused the authorities of targeting his son for his political views. \"The charges against him are baseless,\" he said. \"They are simply a pretext to silence him and intimidate others who dare to speak out.\"\nThis is not the first time that Chinese authorities have been accused of cracking down on dissent. Human rights groups have long criticized the government's use of vague charges such as \"inciting subversion of state power\" to silence political opponents, journalists, and activists.\nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, Chinese authorities have detained and prosecuted thousands of people for politically motivated reasons, including peacefully expressing their opinions online or on social media.\nThe father's protests have garnered support from other activists and dissidents, who have called for the charges against his son to be dropped. \"We stand behind this father and his son and demand that the government respect their right to free speech,\" said one activist. \"The charges against him are a clear violation of his human rights and must be dropped.\"\nThe trial of the dissident is set to take place against a backdrop of rising tensions between China and the West. The US and other countries have been increasingly vocal in their criticism of China's human rights record, especially with regards to its treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province.\nChina has bristled at this criticism, accusing Western countries of interference in its internal affairs. Chinese officials have also accused the US of \"double standards\" and hypocrisy, pointing to its own human rights abuses, such as police brutality against Black Americans and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.\nHowever, critics argue that China's human rights abuses are on a much larger scale than anything the US has ever done. The Chinese government has been accused of forced labor, genocide, and cultural erasure against the Uyghurs, as well as cracking down on democratic protests in Hong Kong and silencing dissidents within its own borders.\nAs the trial of the Chinese dissident approaches, there are fears that it could further strain China's relations with the West. The US and other countries have already imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the treatment of the Uyghurs and other human rights abuses, and there are concerns that the trial of the dissident could be another flashpoint.\nDespite this, the father of the dissident remains defiant. \"My son is innocent and I will continue to speak out for him,\" he said. \"I believe that justice will prevail in the end.\"", "Harvard economist, Professor Larry Summers, has warned that the ongoing uncertainty in Hong Kong could compromise the city's position as the world's second most competitive economy, behind Singapore.\nProfessor Summers, who served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, told a forum in Hong Kong that the uncertainty created by the recent protests and turmoil could deter investment and undermine the city's economic fundamentals.\n\"Hong Kong has been a beacon of stability and a gateway to the Chinese market for many years, and its success is built on the rule of law, a transparent and efficient system of governance, and a world-class infrastructure,\" Professor Summers said.\n\"But the recent protests and the ongoing political uncertainty raise concerns about the future of those pillars, and if investors and businesses start to lose confidence in Hong Kong as a hub of commerce, it could damage the city's long-term prospects.\"\nHong Kong has been rocked by months of protests, triggered initially by a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to China's mainland for trial. The protests have evolved into a broader movement calling for democratic reforms, and have seen violent clashes between protesters and police.\nThe turmoil has taken a toll on Hong Kong's economy, with the government forecasting a contraction in gross domestic product for 2019, the first time since the global financial crisis in 2009.\nHowever, Hong Kong still boasts many advantages that contribute to its competitive edge, including a highly educated workforce, attractive tax regime, and strategic location as a gateway to the Chinese market.\nSingapore, which topped the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Report for 2019, also faces its own challenges, including an aging population, a tight labor market, and rising geopolitical risks.\n\"Singapore has been very successful in building a knowledge-based economy and attracting global talent, but it also faces some structural challenges that could limit its long-term growth potential,\" Professor Summers said.\n\"Both Hong Kong and Singapore are facing headwinds, and they will need to be proactive in addressing these challenges and capitalizing on their strengths if they want to remain at the forefront of the global economy.\"\nA recent report by the Asian Development Bank noted that while Hong Kong has a \"highly competitive and open economy,\" it faces challenges in \"adapting to new technologies and business models, enhancing labor productivity, and attracting and retaining talent.\"\nThe report called for Hong Kong to \"redouble its efforts to create an innovation-friendly environment, invest in education and training, and promote a more diversified economic structure.\"\nProfessor Summers echoed those recommendations, noting that \"the key to Hong Kong's success is its ability to adapt to changing circumstances and stay ahead of the curve.\"\n\"If Hong Kong can maintain its commitment to the rule of law, transparency, and openness, while also investing in innovation, education, and human capital, it could continue to be a powerhouse of the global economy,\" he said.\n\"However, if the current uncertainty persists or escalates, it could undermine the city's economic stability and diminish its competitive advantage. The stakes are high, and the time to act is now.\"", "Computer Associates (CA) announced on Tuesday its plan to expand its systems management software to new platforms and strengthen ties with Microsoft and other technology companies.

These include introducing flat-rate internet pricing and hiring Robert Pittman as the head of their online service.\nAs AOL announced this new direction, they made it very clear that they intend to become a powerful and influential player in the media world. To accomplish this, AOL will be shifting its focus from being a subscription-based internet service provider to creating and distributing high-quality content across multiple platforms.\nIn order to compete with other mass media companies like Netflix and Amazon, AOL is investing heavily in its original content and multimedia capabilities. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with other major media corporations, such as NBC Universal and Twentieth Century Fox, to help them expand their reach.\nBut the most significant change that AOL has made is the introduction of flat-rate internet pricing. This move is aimed at making their service more accessible and affordable for the average consumer.\nAccording to Tim Armstrong, the CEO of AOL, they are doing away with their old pricing model because it was \"too confusing and too expensive.\" The new plan is much simpler, with just two options: a basic plan that costs $20 a month for up to 20 hours of internet usage, and a premium plan that costs $30 a month for unlimited usage.\nThis new pricing plan is a major shift for AOL, which has historically charged by the hour for its dial-up internet service. But as the world has moved towards more high-speed and always-on internet connections, AOL has had to adapt. With this new flat-rate pricing model, AOL hopes to attract a wider range of customers, including those who may have previously shied away from the service due to high and complicated pricing.\nThe final major change that AOL has made is the hiring of Robert Pittman as the head of their online service. Pittman has an impressive background in media, having previously served as the CEO of both MTV Networks and Clear Channel Communications. His expertise in both traditional and digital media will be a huge asset to AOL as they continue to navigate their new focus on becoming a mass media company.\nPittman's appointment comes at a critical time for AOL, as the company tries to expand its reach and presence in the media world. According to Armstrong, Pittman will play a key role in helping AOL to \"create and distribute the best possible content for our consumers.\" With his experience and expertise, Pittman is expected to bring a lot to the table in terms of creative leadership and strategic planning.\nOverall, the changes that AOL has made are a clear signal of the company's ambition to become a major player in the media world. By shifting their focus from subscriptions to content, and by introducing new pricing options and hiring fresh talent, the company is positioning itself for real success in the years to come.\nHowever, it is important to note that this shift will not happen overnight. AOL will need to put in a lot of hard work and invest substantial resources if they wish to truly become a mass media company. But with these changes in place, they are certainly off to a strong start. We can expect to see continued growth and innovation from AOL in the months and years to come.", "The family of Chinese dissident Wang Dan has finally found a lawyer to represent him at his upcoming trial. Initially, Wang Dan\u2019s family had struggled to find a lawyer as many lawyers in China are hesitant to take on high-profile political cases out of fear of retaliation from the Chinese government.\nWang Dan, an activist from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, was arrested on July 1st after sharing a petition on social media in support of the Hong Kong democracy movement. According to Chinese officials, Wang is facing charges of \u201cattempting to subvert state power\u201d, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.\nWang Dan\u2019s family had pleaded for help from human rights organizations and lawyers to represent him at his trial, but they received little response due to the Chinese government\u2019s recent crackdown on dissent and civil rights activists.\nHowever, Wang Dan\u2019s family did not give up hope and continued to search for a lawyer to represent him. Eventually, Beijing-based human rights lawyer Liu Xiaoyuan agreed to take on the case.\nLiu Xiaoyuan is a well-known human rights lawyer who has represented other political dissidents such as Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in custody in 2017. Liu Xiaoyuan has also defended Chinese activists who have protested against the Chinese government\u2019s policies in Tibet and Xinjiang.\nLiu Xiaoyuan has stated that he will do his best to defend Wang Dan, but he is also aware of the challenges he will face due to the Chinese government\u2019s strict control over the judicial system. Liu has stated that he believes Wang Dan is innocent and that his arrest is an example of the Chinese government\u2019s growing intolerance of dissent.\nWang Dan\u2019s arrest has been widely condemned by international human rights groups and politicians. The United States has called for Wang\u2019s immediate release, and the European Parliament has also expressed its concern over his detention.\nWang Dan\u2019s case is just one of many examples of China\u2019s growing crackdown on dissent and civil rights activists. Thousands of Chinese activists, lawyers, and dissidents have been arrested in recent years, as the Chinese government tries to maintain its grip on power and suppress any form of opposition.\nThe Chinese government has defended its actions, stating that it is necessary for national security and stability, but critics argue that it is a violation of basic human rights and freedom of expression.\nAs Wang Dan\u2019s trial approaches, his family and supporters are calling for his release and for the Chinese government to respect human rights and the rule of law.\nWang Dan\u2019s case is a reminder of the ongoing struggle for human rights and democracy in China. Despite the challenges and risks, activists and dissidents continue to speak out, hoping to bring about change in a country where dissent is met with repression.\nThe outcome of Wang Dan\u2019s trial remains uncertain, but his family and supporters are determined to continue fighting for his release and for the recognition of human rights in China.", "As Beijing gathers for a key meeting, Hong Kong is waiting nervously to see what the outcome will mean for its future. The gathering will set the tone for the post-colonial government of the city, and there are fears that it could be a major turning point in the ongoing struggle over Hong Kong's autonomy.\nThe meeting in Beijing is known as the \"Two Sessions\", and it is the annual gathering of China's top legislative and political advisory bodies. This year's meeting is particularly important for Hong Kong, as it comes just months after the city was rocked by widespread protests in support of greater autonomy from China.\nThe protests, which began in June 2019 and continued for months, were sparked by a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong residents to be extradited to mainland China for trial. The bill was eventually withdrawn, but the protests continued, with demonstrators calling for universal suffrage and greater protections for civil liberties.\nThe Beijing gathering will be closely watched by both Hong Kong residents and the international community, as it is expected to lay out the Chinese government's plans for the city in the coming years. Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, is also expected to attend the meeting, and she will likely face pressure from Beijing to crack down on dissent and maintain order in the city.\nMany in Hong Kong fear that the Chinese government will use the meeting to further erode the city's autonomy and crack down on dissent. There are already signs that this is happening, with several prominent pro-democracy activists and lawmakers arrested in recent months on charges of \"subversion\" and other vague crimes.\nThe Chinese government has also been cracking down on the city's media and educational institutions, with many journalists and academics facing pressure to adhere to the Communist Party's ideology.\nProtests have returned to the streets of Hong Kong in recent weeks, with demonstrators calling for the release of those arrested in the government crackdown. The protests have been met with a heavy police presence, and there are concerns that the situation could escalate if the Beijing meeting results in further restrictions on civil liberties.\nDespite these concerns, there are also some who remain optimistic about Hong Kong's future. Some analysts believe that the Chinese government may be willing to compromise on some aspects of its policies in order to maintain stability in the city.\nThere have also been calls from Hong Kong residents for the city to focus on developing its own economy and fostering greater cooperation with other countries in the region. This could help to reduce the city's reliance on China and strengthen its position as a global financial hub.\nWhatever the outcome of the Beijing meeting, it is clear that Hong Kong is at a crossroads. The city is facing significant challenges as it seeks to maintain its autonomy and protect its civil liberties, while also navigating its relationship with the Chinese government.\nThe coming months will be crucial for Hong Kong, and it remains to be seen what the future holds. For now, residents are watching and waiting with bated breath, hoping for a positive outcome from the Beijing gathering.", "The recent decision by the Federal Reserve to expand bank activities has stirred up a wave of reactions from analysts and industry officials, who believe that the move has further intensified the push towards an overhaul of the US banking regulations.\nThe Federal Reserve voted last week to alter its rules regarding the Volcker Rule, which was implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis to prevent banks from engaging in proprietary trading and making certain types of speculative investments. The Volcker Rule had long been viewed by banks as a burdensome regulation that limited their ability to generate profits.\nThe change to the Volcker Rule will now allow banks to invest in venture capital funds, broaden their trading activities, and simplify their compliance regulations. The Federal Reserve noted that the changes will allow banks to better serve their customers and strengthen the financial system.\nHowever, critics of the changes argue that the deregulation of the banking sector could lead to risky behavior and increase the likelihood of another financial crisis. They believe that the changes are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to unravel the post-crisis regulatory framework that was established to protect consumers and prevent future economic disasters.\nBanks and industry groups, on the other hand, have lauded the changes, arguing that they will provide greater flexibility and clarity to their operations. They believe that the modifications will enable them to more effectively manage their risks and generate higher returns for their investors.\nAnalysts and experts have weighed in on the implications of the Federal Reserve's decision. Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University, stated that the alterations to the Volcker Rule could exacerbate the structural problems in the US financial system, increasing the risk of another systemic shock.\nOthers believe that the changes highlight the ongoing conflict between the need for stability and the desire for growth in the financial sector. The forthcoming changes to the regulations, including the proposed overhaul of Dodd-Frank, will continue to shape the banking landscape in the US and the world at large.\nIrrespective of the differing viewpoints, there is no denying that the changes to the Volcker Rule are part of a larger trend of deregulation and loosening of the reins on the financial industry. While the effects of this shift may not be visible immediately, it is certain that its consequences will shape the direction of the US banking sector and the economy for years to come.", "The CEO of ITT Automotive Inc, Richard Calore, made a contentious announcement at the company's annual shareholder meeting. He stated that the company is planning to pay its workers less than $10 an hour by 2000. This move is part of the company's cost-cutting measures, as it struggles to remain profitable in an increasingly competitive market.\nThe announcement was met with shock and anger from the company's employees and union representatives. Many of them expressed concern that such a low wage could jeopardize the livelihoods of ITT Automotive's workers. They argue that a lower wage could lead to a reduced quality of life for their families, and that it sets a dangerous precedent for other companies to follow.\nOne union representative was quoted as saying, \"This is unacceptable. The workers at ITT Automotive deserve fair compensation for their hard work. We will fight tooth and nail to make sure that they receive a living wage.\"\nCalore defended the decision, stating that the company could not maintain its current wage structure and remain competitive in the market. He added that the company was committed to providing competitive benefits packages to its employees, including healthcare and retirement plans.\nThe announcement comes as ITT Automotive faces stiff competition from other automotive suppliers, both domestic and foreign. The company has seen its profits decline in recent years as a result of these challenges. In response, ITT Automotive has been implementing a series of cost-cutting measures aimed at improving its bottom line.\nSome experts have expressed concern that a wage reduction could have a negative impact on the company's overall operations. They argue that a lower wage could lead to reduced morale and productivity among workers, resulting in decreased quality and consistency in the company's products.\nOthers, however, have praised ITT Automotive's decision, arguing that it is a necessary step in order to remain competitive in a global market. \"This is just the reality of the situation,\" said one industry analyst. \"If you want to succeed in this business, you have to make tough decisions and cut costs where you can.\"\nAs of now, it is unclear how ITT Automotive's workers and union representatives will respond to the company's announcement. However, the announcement has certainly generated significant controversy, and it remains to be seen how it will impact the company's operations going forward.", "Russia, being one of the world's largest producers of oil, has been experiencing some ups and downs in its oil production levels. However, recent data suggests that the country's oil output is steadily stabilizing, though an increase remains elusive.\nAccording to the Russian Energy Ministry, the country pumped an average of 10.41 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in August 2020, which is a decline from the 11.29 million bpd in the same month last year. While it is still a drop, it shows signs of stabilizing, as July's production was 10.39 million bpd.\nThe decline in oil production is attributed to the country's agreement with OPEC+ to cut production levels in order to stabilize global oil prices. Russia, together with Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries, have implemented a series of production cuts throughout the year to address the oversupply of crude oil in the market.\nDespite the decrease in oil production, Russia is still one of the leading oil producers in the world and has been sustaining its ranking year after year. In 2019, the country produced around 11.25 million bpd of oil, making it the second-largest producer after the United States.\nBut with the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc on global oil demand, Russia, like many other oil-producing countries, has had to adjust its production levels to match market demand. The production cuts, which were implemented in May, have been extended until the end of 2020, and this has contributed to the stabilization of Russia's oil output.\nHowever, the stabilization does not necessarily mean an increase in oil production. It is still unclear when Russia's oil production levels will return to pre-pandemic levels since the pandemic's impact on oil demand remains unpredictable.\nSome experts remain optimistic, hoping that the increasing demand for oil from China will provide a much-needed boost. China, which is the world's largest oil importer, has been actively importing oil from Russia, increasing its imports by a staggering 170% in the first quarter of 2020. This increase in demand could help Russia's oil industry recover from the pandemic-related slump.\nAdditionally, Russia's recent efforts to boost investment in its oil sector could also lead to higher output levels in the future. The government has been rolling out measures to attract more foreign investors to its oil industry, with the ultimate goal of increasing production levels. The country aims to double the production of oil and gas condensate by 2035, from the current levels of around 11 million bpd.\nHowever, the industry's potential for growth faces several challenges, such as the country's ageing oil fields, which require significant investments to maintain production levels. Furthermore, the country's oil infrastructure, such as pipelines and refineries, needs extensive upgrades to support higher output levels.\nAnother issue is the US sanctions that have limited foreign investment in Russia's oil industry. Recently, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of the world's largest investors, announced that it would divest from companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and gas in Russia. This move highlights how international sanctions continue to impact Russia's oil sector.\nIn conclusion, while Russia's oil production levels show signs of stabilizing, growth remains elusive. The country's agreement with OPEC+ to cut production levels, the COVID-19 pandemic's unpredictable impact on oil demand, and the challenges involved in increasing production pose significant hurdles for Russia's oil industry. However, with the recent efforts to attract foreign investment and the growing demand from China, there is hope for the industry's future growth.", "In a joint statement released yesterday, technology giants Netscape and Microsoft agreed that the so-called \"browser wars\" of the past few years have been \"silly\" and \"counterproductive\". The two companies, which have been locked in a bitter battle for dominance in the world of internet browsing software, expressed a desire to put their differences behind them and move forward in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration.\n\"Looking back, we realize that the browser wars were a distraction from what was really important - providing users with the best possible web experience,\" the statement read. \"We both believe that there is a lot of room for innovation and growth in this field, and that by working together we can create products that are more secure, more reliable, and more user-friendly than ever before.\"\nDespite this conciliatory tone, however, observers noted that the sparks still seemed to be flying between the two companies. Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, for instance, took the opportunity to criticize Microsoft's business practices, saying that the company's dominant market position had been gained through \"anti-competitive\" tactics.\n\"It's no secret that Microsoft has done everything in its power to squash competition in the browser market,\" Andreessen told reporters. \"They've abused their dominant position to force users to use their software, and they've stolen our ideas and incorporated them into their own products without permission.\"\nMicrosoft, for its part, was quick to deny these accusations. \"We've always competed fairly and honestly in the browser market,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We believe in offering users a choice, and we've worked hard to innovate and provide the best possible products. We're glad that Netscape recognizes the importance of competition, and we look forward to continuing to compete with them and other players in this space.\"\nDespite the lingering tensions between the two companies, experts say that the agreement to work together is a positive sign for the technology industry as a whole. \"The browser wars have been one of the most bitter and prolonged battles in the history of the tech industry,\" said analyst Peter Williams. \"By coming together and acknowledging the silliness of the whole thing, Netscape and Microsoft are setting an example for other companies to follow. They're showing that even bitter rivals can find common ground and work together for the greater good.\"\nIndeed, the joint statement released by the two companies outlined a number of initiatives they plan to undertake together in the coming months. These include:\n- Collaborating on new web standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability between their respective browsers.\n- Sharing security information and best practices to help protect users from online threats.\n- Exploring new ways to make web browsing faster, more efficient, and more intuitive.\n- Partnering on research and development efforts related to the future of the internet and the role of browsers in that future.\n\"By working together, we believe that we can create products that are better and more innovative than either of us could create alone,\" the statement read. \"We both recognize the importance of the internet and the role that browsers play in shaping its future. We're excited to see what we can achieve by combining our strengths and expertise.\"\nReaction to the agreement has been mostly positive, with many technology industry experts praising the companies for putting aside their differences and working together. \"This is a win-win for both companies and for the industry as a whole,\" said tech analyst John Smith. \"It shows that even companies that have been bitter rivals for years can find common ground and work together for the good of their users.\"\nOthers, however, remain skeptical about the deal. \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" said software developer Sarah Lee. \"These companies have been fighting tooth and nail for so long, it's hard to imagine them suddenly becoming best friends. There's still a lot of bad blood between them, and I'm not sure that's going to go away overnight.\"\nIt remains to be seen how successful the Netscape-Microsoft partnership will be in the long run. But regardless of the outcome, it's clear that the agreement marks a significant shift in the tech industry - a shift away from bitter rivalries and towards a more collaborative, cooperative future. Whether or not the sparks continue to fly between these two giants, it seems likely that we'll see more partnerships and alliances emerge in the years to come. In a world of rapidly-changing technology and ever-increasing competition, the only constant may be the need to work together in order to stay ahead.", "Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE), one of the largest utilities companies in France, has announced higher profits due to strong growth across its key segments. The company has also revealed plans to reorganise its troubled construction business, which has been a source of concern for investors for several quarters.\nAccording to the financial reports released by CGE, the company recorded a net profit of \u20ac585 million in the first quarter of 2021, up by 10% compared to the same period last year. This result was driven by improved performance across the group's core businesses, including water, waste management, and energy.\nIn particular, CGE's water division saw a significant uptick in profits, increasing by 12% to \u20ac2.3 billion, due to strong demand for the company's services amid rising awareness around water scarcity and sustainability. Similarly, the waste management unit saw a 7% increase in profits to \u20ac690 million, underpinned by increased investments in recycling and waste-to-energy projects.\nHowever, the company's construction business, which represents a small but critical part of CGE's portfolio, continued to underperform, recording a net loss of \u20ac40 million in the first quarter. This figure follows a string of disappointing results for the division, which has struggled with low margins, cost overruns, and project delays.\nTo address these challenges, CGE has announced plans to restructure its construction business, including the creation of a new subsidiary that will focus on high-margin construction projects, such as airports, railways, and power plants.\n\"We recognise that the construction industry is going through a difficult phase, with intense competition and margin pressures,\" said Jean-Pierre Fournier, chairman of CGE. \"To address these challenges, we are taking steps to reorganise our construction business, streamline our operations, and focus on projects that offer higher profitability and better risk profiles.\"\nFournier added that the company was confident in its ability to turn the construction division around, citing a strong backlog of projects and a skilled workforce as key advantages.\nInvestors welcomed the news of CGE's strong profits and plans to restructure its construction business, with shares in the company rising by 3% in early trading on Tuesday. The company's stock has been under pressure in recent months due to concerns over the weak construction business, as well as uncertainty around the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the utilities sector.\nHowever, analysts caution that CGE still faces a challenging operating environment, with mounting regulatory pressures, rising raw material costs, and a rapidly changing competitive landscape.\n\"The utilities industry is undergoing significant transformation, driven by the shift towards renewable energy, the digitisation of infrastructure, and increasing regulatory scrutiny,\" said Yves No\u00ebl, an analyst at investment bank BNP Paribas. \"CGE will need to remain agile, innovative, and adaptable to capitalise on opportunities and mitigate risks in this dynamic environment.\"\nDespite these challenges, CGE remains one of the strongest players in the utilities sector, with a sizable and diversified business model, a track record of innovation and investment, and a commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The company operates across 70 countries and employs more than 300,000 people worldwide.", "In a major move that could have significant implications for businesses and investors, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke has announced he is considering cutting tax credits on dividends as part of his upcoming budget speech.\nThe tax credits on dividends, which are paid to shareholders in companies, currently stand at 10%. However, under the Chancellor\u2019s proposal, that figure could be reduced or even eliminated altogether. The move is part of a wider effort to overhaul the UK\u2019s tax system and raise revenue for public services.\nSpeaking ahead of his budget speech, Mr Clarke said that he believes the tax credit system is \u201coutdated\u201d and \u201cunfair.\u201d He argued that the current system disproportionately benefits wealthier investors who are able to take advantage of tax loopholes and avoid paying their fair share.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re serious about building an economy that works for everyone, we need to make sure that our tax system is fair and equitable,\u201d Mr Clarke said. \u201cAt present, the tax credits on dividends are an outdated and unfair system that benefits the wealthiest in our society at the expense of everyone else. By reforming the system, we can raise vital revenue and ensure that everyone pays their fair share.\u201d\nThe move has been welcomed by some experts, who argue that the current system is long overdue for reform. They point out that many wealthy investors use tax credits on dividends to avoid paying income tax, which places a disproportionate burden on middle and low-income earners.\n\u201cFor too long, the tax system has been rigged in favor of the wealthiest in our society,\u201d said John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. \u201cBy cutting tax credits on dividends, we can ensure that everyone pays their fair share and that public services are adequately funded.\u201d\nHowever, the proposal has also been met with opposition from some quarters. Business leaders have warned that the move could discourage investment in UK companies and harm the economy. They argue that reducing tax credits on dividends could lead to a decrease in investment, which could in turn have negative consequences for the wider business community.\n\u201cInvestment is the lifeblood of the economy,\u201d said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry. \u201cBy cutting tax credits on dividends, the Chancellor risks discouraging investment in UK companies and undermining our competitiveness. We urge him to reconsider this move and instead focus on creating a tax system that rewards investment and promotes economic growth.\u201d\nThe Chancellor\u2019s budget speech is expected to be delivered in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen whether he will proceed with his proposal to cut tax credits on dividends, or if he will take the concerns of businesses and investors into account and pursue a different approach. Either way, the proposals are likely to have a significant impact on the UK economy and the wider business community.", "Market research firms are divided in their predictions for the demand of personal computers in the third quarter of the year. While some believe in a half-empty scenario, others see a half-full outcome.\nAccording to a report by Gartner, personal computer shipments will decline by 2.1 percent in the third quarter of 2021, reaching 71.6 million units. However, another research firm, IDC, predicts a growth of 14.2 percent in the same period, with 87.8 million units shipped.\nThe contrast between these two predictions stems from different factors that could impact the personal computer market in the coming months. One of the main reasons for Gartner's pessimistic outlook is the global chip shortage, which has affected the production and shipment of various electronic devices, including personal computers. This issue has led to higher prices and longer waiting times for customers.\nMoreover, Gartner highlights the shift in consumer preferences towards tablets and smartphones, which offer better mobility and functionality for everyday tasks compared to traditional desktop and laptop computers.\nOn the other hand, IDC points out the increase in demand for personal computers from remote workers and students who need reliable devices for online learning and telecommuting. The pandemic has forced many individuals and organizations to adapt to new ways of working and studying, which has boosted the sales of computers, particularly those with advanced features such as touchscreens and convertibles.\nAccording to research by Statista, the global market for personal computers was valued at over 300 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, with an estimated growth rate of 4.5 percent for 2021. This indicates the importance of personal computers as essential tools for various industries and segments of society.\nDespite the contrasting views on personal computer demand in the third quarter, it is clear that the market is undergoing significant changes influenced by technological advancements, economic factors, and social trends.\nFor instance, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms is transforming the way personal computers are used for data analysis, automation, and decision-making. This has implications for businesses, government agencies, and academic researchers looking for innovative ways to meet the demands of a digital economy.\nMoreover, the increasing focus on cybersecurity and privacy concerns is driving the demand for personal computers with enhanced features such as biometric authentication, data encryption, and anti-virus software. This represents an opportunity for computer manufacturers to differentiate their products in a crowded market and meet the evolving needs of customers.\nAs the personal computer market evolves, it is important for market research firms to keep abreast of the latest trends, innovations, and challenges. This requires a multidisciplinary approach that draws on insights from technology, economics, sociology, psychology, and other fields.\nMarket research firms need to leverage data analytics tools and methodologies to collect, analyze, and interpret data from multiple sources, including surveys, polls, social media, search engines, and customer feedback. This will enable them to build accurate and reliable forecasts that inform strategic decision-making for businesses, investors, policymakers, and other stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, the disagreement between market research firms on third-quarter personal computer demand reflects the complexity and dynamism of the market. The trends and drivers shaping personal computer sales are multifaceted and interdependent, requiring a holistic understanding and analysis.\nRather than taking a half-full or half-empty approach, market research firms should adopt a nuanced and evidence-based perspective that considers the long-term prospects, opportunities, and risks of the personal computer market. This will enable them to provide valuable insights and advice that help businesses and other stakeholders navigate the changing landscape of technology and society.", "Toronto, Canada - The Toronto stock market closed at a record high for the 51st time in 1996 on Tuesday, amid a rally in interest-sensitive issues and expectations of an interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada.\nThe benchmark S&P/TSX composite index finished the day at 14,363.11, up 67.69 points from the previous day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose by 2.4 percent, driven by the strong performance of Intel, Microsoft, and Cisco.\nThe jump in global equity markets was triggered by a rally in interest-sensitive stocks as investors bet on a cut in interest rates by the Bank of Canada, which is expected to support economic growth. The rally was also fueled by strong earnings reports from some of the biggest banks in Canada.\nBank of Montreal reported a third-quarter profit of $1.6 billion, beating market expectations, while Bank of Nova Scotia reported a third-quarter profit of $2.3 billion, up from $1.9 billion in the previous year.\n\"The strength of the banks' earnings is an indication that the Canadian economy is performing well and it is likely that the Bank of Canada will follow the US Federal Reserve and cut interest rates,\" said David Redford, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities.\nThe rally in interest-sensitive issues was led by the gold and energy sectors, with shares of Barrick Gold Corp, Goldcorp Inc, and Suncor Energy Inc rising by 2.1 percent, 2.4 percent, and 1.8 percent respectively.\nThe performance of the Toronto stock market was also driven by a string of positive economic reports, including better-than-expected employment data and strong retail sales figures. Canada's unemployment rate fell to 7 percent in July from 7.1 percent in the previous month, while retail sales rose by 0.7 percent in June, beating expectations.\n\"The Canadian economy is showing signs of strength, with improvements in employment and retail sales, and this is reflected in the performance of the stock market,\" said Redford.\nThe positive sentiment also spilled over into the Canadian dollar, which climbed to a one-month high against the US dollar on Tuesday. The loonie rose by 0.5 cents to close at 77.90 cents US.", "Shanghai's iconic Hongkong & Shanghai Bank (HSBC) building, located on the famous Bund promenade, has been put up for rent after being vacant for over a decade. According to sources, the government has decided to lease the historic property to an unnamed bank, which has expressed interest in occupying the space.\nBuilt in the neo-classical style, the HSBC building was completed in 1923 and served as the bank's headquarters for over six decades. The building was the first high-rise on the Bund and was designed to be a symbol of modernity and prosperity in China.\nThe building's interior features stunning marble floors, ornate stained glass windows, and an impressive bank vault in the basement. The exterior boasts columns and pediments inspired by ancient Greek architecture, while the iconic clock tower rises above the city skyline.\nFor many years, the HSBC building was a landmark in Shanghai, a symbol of the city's rise as an international financial center. But the bank moved its headquarters to Hong Kong in 1986, and the building was left vacant for years.\nIn 2001, the Shanghai government announced plans to turn the HSBC building into a museum, showcasing the city's history as a financial center. However, these plans were put on hold due to the high costs of renovation and maintenance.\nNow, with the city's real estate market booming, the government has decided to lease the property to a bank that will not only pay rent but also take on the costs of the building's upkeep.\nThe unnamed bank has reportedly been selected after a rigorous bidding process, with several banks showing interest in occupying the space. According to sources, the bank has agreed to pay a record-high rent for the building, as well as take on the costs of renovation and maintenance.\nThe move has been welcomed by many in the city, who see it as a positive step towards the revitalization of the Bund. The HSBC building is one of the most iconic structures on the promenade, and its occupancy by a bank is seen as a fitting tribute to its history.\nThe move is also seen as a sign of the city's growing importance as a global financial center. Shanghai is home to the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is the headquarters of several major Chinese banks. The leasing of the HSBC building to a bank is seen as a further indication of the city's ambitions to become a leading financial center in Asia.\nHowever, some have raised concerns about the impact of the move on the Bund's heritage. The Bund is home to many historic buildings, and there are fears that the leasing of the HSBC building to a modern bank could detract from the area's historical charm.\nNevertheless, the government has assured the public that the building's historic features will be preserved, and the bank will be required to maintain the building's original appearance.\nThe leasing of the HSBC building to an unnamed bank is set to inject new life into one of Shanghai's most iconic landmarks. The move is seen as a positive step towards the revitalization of the Bund, as well as a sign of the city's growing importance as a global financial center.", "Republic Industries, the Florida-based conglomerate, has recently defended its plans to acquire ADT, the security company, amidst reports suggesting that the potential deal has been canceled.\nThe proposed acquisition has been the subject of much speculation in recent weeks. Reports emerged earlier this month that suggested ADT was either seeking alternative acquisition offers or considering not going through with any sale at all.\nHowever, Republic Industries remains steadfast in its intention to purchase ADT for around $7 billion. The conglomerate has released a statement defending its stance and reiterating the benefits that the acquisition would bring to both companies.\n\"Republic Industries firmly believes that acquiring ADT would create a stronger, more versatile business that is ideally positioned for long-term success,\" the statement reads. \"We have had productive discussions with ADT's management team and we remain committed to pursuing this acquisition.\"\nThe statement also highlighted the strategic advantages that the acquisition could offer. By combining ADT's expertise in home security with Republic's expertise across a wide range of industries, the new company would be well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for internet-connected security systems.\nHowever, some industry analysts have expressed concerns about the potential acquisition. They point to ADT's recent financial struggles, with the company's stock price having fallen significantly over the past year. Some fear that the acquisition could be a risky move for Republic Industries, particularly given the uncertainty in the current economic climate.\nDespite these concerns, Republic Industries appears to be undeterred. The company's CEO, Marc Lefar, recently confirmed in an interview that the acquisition is still on the table. He also emphasized the importance of ADT's brand and its customer base, suggesting that these factors would be key drivers of growth for the new company.\nAs the acquisition saga continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether Republic Industries will be successful in its bid to purchase ADT. However, the conglomerate's decision to stick to its guns suggests that it is confident in the potential of the deal \u2013 and that it is willing to weather the current uncertainties in order to achieve its strategic goals.", "A new high-society magazine called \"The Chinese\" is set to rival popular publications like Cosmopolitan and Vanity Fair in the ethnic Chinese communities worldwide.

The new company, which will be called Cable & Wireless Connect, will combine Cable & Wireless' existing fibre-optic network with Virgin Media's cable network to create a new infrastructure that will be capable of supporting even higher internet speeds and greater reliability.\nBT has long been the dominant player in the UK telecoms market, controlling much of the country's infrastructure and providing services to millions of customers. However, the company has come under increasing pressure in recent years from smaller, more agile players, who have challenged its position in the market.\nCable & Wireless has been one of these challengers, building a strong presence in the UK market by offering high-quality internet services to businesses and consumers alike. With the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect, the company is now seeking to take on BT on an even bigger scale, providing a new network that will offer faster speeds, greater reliability, and more choice to customers.\nThe new company will be led by Cable & Wireless CEO Phil Dance, who said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect was an \"exciting development\" for the company, and would help it to better serve the needs of its customers. \"By combining our existing fibre-optic network with Virgin Media's cable network, we will be able to offer a range of new services and capabilities that simply aren't available from our competitors,\" he said.\nSome analysts have said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect could have significant implications for the UK telecoms market, and could mark the beginning of a new era of competition in the industry. \"This is a big move for Cable & Wireless, and it's one that could help to challenge BT's dominance in the market,\" said Peter Mandelson, a telecoms analyst with consultants Ovum.\n\"By creating a new network that can offer higher speeds and greater reliability, Cable & Wireless Connect could really make a dent in BT's market share, and even steal customers away from the company.\"\nHowever, others have said that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect will not be enough to challenge BT's dominance in the UK market, and that the company will need to do more if it really wants to take on the telecoms giant. \"While Cable & Wireless Connect is certainly a step in the right direction, it's not going to be easy to take on BT,\" said John Delaney, a telecoms analyst with research firm IDC.\n\"BT has a huge amount of infrastructure and experience in the market, and it's going to take more than a new network to truly compete with the company.\"\nDespite these challenges, Cable & Wireless is confident that the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect will be a major success, and that it will help to significantly grow the company's market share in the UK. \"We believe that there is huge demand for high-quality, reliable internet services in the UK, and that Cable & Wireless Connect is perfectly positioned to meet that demand,\" said Phil Dance.\n\"We have a talented team of engineers and technicians who are working hard to build a network that will offer a new level of speed and reliability to our customers, and we're confident that we can make a real difference in the UK telecoms market.\"\nWith the creation of Cable & Wireless Connect, the UK telecoms market is set for a new era of competition, as Cable & Wireless seeks to take on BT and other major players in the industry.

The study, conducted by the Pew Research Center, showed that 81% of adults in the United States use the internet, with similar figures seen in other advanced economies.\nThe study noted that the increase in internet usage was driven by the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices. Despite this, online businesses are struggling to convert this increased usage into revenue growth.\nThe study found that the biggest challenge facing online businesses was attracting new users. Many respondents indicated that they were satisfied with their current online services and saw no need to switch to new providers.\n\"Competition is fierce in the online space,\" said John Smith, a marketing analyst at the Pew Research Center.\u00a0\"Online businesses need to constantly innovate and offer unique products or services that can set them apart from their competitors.\"\nAnother factor contributing to the challenge of attracting new customers is the high level of trust that users have in their current providers. This trust leads users to be hesitant to switch to new providers, even if they offer better pricing or services.\nThe study also revealed that online businesses were struggling to retain their existing customers. Many users reported feeling dissatisfied with the level of customer service they received from their online service providers. Businesses need to prioritize customer service and ensure that their users feel valued and supported.\nDespite these challenges, online businesses remain optimistic about the future. Many are investing heavily in new technologies and products that they believe will help them attract and retain customers. They are also looking to expand into new markets and offer a broader range of services to their users.\n\"Online businesses have come a long way in the past decade,\" said Smith. \"But they need to continue to evolve and innovate if they want to stay competitive and grow their user base.\"\nIn conclusion, the survey highlights the need for online businesses to prioritize customer satisfaction and differentiate themselves from their competitors. Increasing internet usage presents an opportunity for online services to grow their customer base, but they need to understand their users' needs and offer unique products and services that demonstrate their value.", "BT Beats Analyst Forecasts with Strong Profits and Growth Despite Competition\nBT Group, the UK's largest telecoms operator, has reported better-than-expected profits and growth, despite facing stiff competition in the industry. The company, which is in the midst of a major transformation programme, revealed a 7% increase in revenue in its latest financial results.\nThe telecoms giant recorded a pre-tax profit of \u00a32.6bn ($3.4bn) for the financial year ending March 31, beating analysts' forecasts. This represented a 12% increase in profits compared to the previous year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose by 2%.\nBT's strong performance was driven by growth in its consumer division, which includes BT TV and EE mobile, as well as its Openreach infrastructure unit. The company saw significant growth in fibre broadband, with over half a million customers signing up over the past year.\nBT's CEO, Philip Jansen, said the company had demonstrated \"resilience\" in the face of tough market conditions. \"It was an extraordinary year, with Covid-19 impacting every aspect of our business,\" he said. \"Despite these challenges, our colleagues have worked tirelessly to keep the nation connected.\"\nJansen said that the company's investment in new technologies, such as 5G and full fibre, would help to secure its long-term future. \"We have accelerated our plans to roll out full fibre across the UK, and we are investing in 5G to bring the latest mobile technology to our customers,\" he said.\nHowever, BT's strong performance was overshadowed by concerns about its ability to continue growing, as it faces increased competition from rivals such as Virgin Media and Sky. The company's share price has dropped by more than a third over the past year, as investors fret over declining revenues and margins.\nAnalysts have also raised concerns about BT's pension deficit, which stood at \u00a37.9bn at the end of March. The company has pledged to make \u00a33bn in cash contributions to the pension fund over the next three years, but some experts have questioned whether this will be enough to meet its obligations.\nNevertheless, some analysts were upbeat about BT's prospects. Jefferies analyst, Jerry Dellis, said the company had shown \"early signs of being able to deliver on its transformation plan\".\n\"BT's consumer business had a good year, with a solid performance from EE mobile and better-than-expected growth in BT TV,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, Openreach is benefiting from the roll-out of fibre, which is helping to drive revenue growth.\"\nBT's strong performance comes amid a rapidly changing landscape in the telecoms industry. The UK government is urging telecoms operators to invest in full fibre, with the aim of achieving universal coverage by 2033. Meanwhile, there are increasing calls for greater competition in the sector, with some experts calling for the break-up of BT's Openreach division.\nIn response to these challenges, Jansen said the company was committed to investing in new technologies and making its operations more efficient. \"We are transforming the way we work, using data and technology to improve our services and reduce costs,\" he said.\nBT's results were also buoyed by strong growth in its international business, particularly in Asia and Africa. The company's global services division recorded a 5% increase in revenue, driven by demand for cyber security and cloud services.\nDespite the challenges facing the telecoms industry, BT's performance shows that there are still opportunities for growth and profitability. Whether the company can continue to compete effectively in an increasingly crowded market remains to be seen, but for now, it appears to be on a solid footing.", "The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) announced today that its pre-tax profits for the first quarter of 2021 rose significantly compared to last year, but fell short of analysts' predictions.\nThe UK-based bank reported \u00a3946m pre-tax profit for the first three months of the year, up from \u00a3288m during the same period in 2020. However, this figure was still lower than the expected pre-tax profit of \u00a3968m, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe bank credited its higher profits to a number of factors, including a boost in mortgage lending as the housing market in the UK continues to perform strongly. In addition, RBS said fewer customers were defaulting on loan repayments, which helped to increase its net interest margin.\nHowever, the bank also highlighted the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, with uncertainty still prevailing in the global economy.\n\"Our results this quarter demonstrate the resilience of our business in the face of ongoing challenges,\" said RBS CEO Alison Rose in a statement. \"While we are encouraged by the progress we have made, we remain mindful of the continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\"\nRBS also reported a significant increase in its capital position, with its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio rising to 18.2%, up from 16.2% in the previous quarter. This ratio is a key measure of a bank's financial strength and ability to absorb losses.\nDespite the higher profits and improved capital position, RBS's share price fell in early trading on Friday, indicating that investors were disappointed with the bank's results. The share price was down around 4% when markets opened.\nAnalysts had expected RBS to outperform its rivals in the first quarter, given its strong presence in the UK market and the recent recovery of the stock market. However, the results were seen as a mixed bag, with some positives and some disappointments.\n\"The bottom line is that RBS's results are not as good as they could have been, but they are still quite good in the current environment,\" said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor.\nHunter said that RBS's performance was likely to be closely monitored by investors in the coming months as the bank undergoes a major restructuring plan, which involves reducing its staff and closing hundreds of branches across the UK.\n\"RBS is still in the middle of a turnaround plan, which is going to take time to fully play out,\" he said. \"Investors will want to see more progress in the next few quarters before they make any major decisions about the bank's future.\"", "Norwegian engineering company Kvaerner ASA announced that it is planning to increase its portfolio in the Asia Pacific region, which it believes will be a significant growth area in the coming years.

In a speech made on Wednesday, Davie argued that the current fee of \u00a3157.50 per household per year was necessary to maintain the quality of BBC programming and expand its services.\nDavie's call comes amid increasing pressure on the BBC's finances. The corporation has faced criticism for its management of funds, with allegations of excessive executive pay and wasteful spending on programming. However, Davie argued that the BBC's role as a public service broadcaster required it to maintain high standards and provide a broad range of content for its viewers.\nIn his speech, Davie said, \"The BBC is facing significant financial challenges, but we cannot compromise on the quality of our programming or the range of services we offer. We need to invest in new technology and content to stay competitive in an increasingly digital world. This requires an increase in the licence fee to ensure that we can continue to deliver valued and trusted services to all our viewers.\"\nDavie's proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some commentators have praised his willingness to confront the financial challenges facing the BBC, while others have criticized his call for an increase in the licence fee. The fee is mandatory for all households in the UK that own a television set, and failure to pay can result in fines or even imprisonment.\nOpponents of the licence fee argue that it is an outdated system that unfairly burdens households with an unnecessary expense. They point to the rise of streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime as evidence that viewers are no longer reliant on the BBC's programming. Proponents of the licence fee, however, argue that it provides a stable source of funding for the BBC and ensures that it remains independent of commercial interests.\nThe government has not yet responded to Davie's proposal. The licence fee is set by the government, and any change would require legislation. The last increase in the fee came in 2017, when it was raised from \u00a3147 to \u00a3150.50.\nDespite the controversy surrounding the licence fee, the BBC remains a beloved institution in the UK. Its programming reaches millions of viewers every day, and its news coverage is considered to be among the most reliable in the world. Davie's call for an increase in the licence fee is just the latest chapter in the ongoing debate over the BBC's role in British society and its future funding.", "Data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) indicates that the growth of personal bank deposits in the country has slowed over the past few months. While this may seem like a positive development, analysts warn that it still poses a significant inflation threat.\nAccording to the PBOC, personal bank deposits grew by 7.3% in August, a significant drop from the 8.5% growth seen in July. This trend has continued over the past few months, with the growth rate falling steadily since May.\nOn the surface, this slowing growth may seem like a good thing, as it indicates that Chinese citizens are consuming more and saving less. However, analysts warn that it could actually be a sign of inflationary pressures building in the economy.\nInflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds the supply, driving prices higher. As consumers have more money to spend, they are willing to pay more for goods and services, putting upward pressure on prices. If personal bank deposits are growing at a slower rate, it could be a sign that consumers are spending more, which could lead to inflation down the road.\nThis is a significant concern for the Chinese government, which has been struggling to contain inflationary pressures in recent years. Inflation in China has been stubbornly high, averaging around 2.5% in recent years, despite efforts by the government to bring it under control.\nOne of the main drivers of inflation in China has been its massive housing market, which has experienced a significant boom over the past decade. However, there are concerns that this market may be overheated, and the government has been implementing policies to slow its growth.\nDespite these efforts, analysts believe that inflation remains a significant threat to the Chinese economy, and the slowing growth of personal bank deposits is a worrying sign. While it may be a positive development in the short term, it could indicate deeper underlying problems in the Chinese economy that could lead to inflation down the road.\nOne potential solution to this problem would be for the government to implement measures that encourage Chinese citizens to save more. This could be done through policies such as offering tax incentives for saving or increasing interest rates on savings accounts. By incentivizing savings, the government could help to reduce the amount of money that is flowing into the economy, which would help to control inflation down the road.\nOverall, the slowing growth of personal bank deposits in China is a worrying sign for the Chinese economy. While it may seem like a positive development in the short term, it could indicate deeper underlying problems that could lead to inflation down the road. As such, it is important for the government to take proactive measures to encourage saving and reduce inflationary pressures in the economy.", "Wolseley Plc, the UK's leading distributor of heating, plumbing, and building materials, is set to announce a slight drop in profits for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021.

The company's shares have been trading steadily in recent weeks, and investors will be watching closely for any updates on its growth plans and strategic initiatives.", "Barclays' investment banking arm, Barclays Investment Bank, has announced a major restructuring of its Global Markets division in a bid to compete with its rivals. The move comes in the wake of a string of disappointing financial results, with Barclays' investment banking division having been hit hard by tougher regulations, lower profits, and increased competition.\nThe restructuring is designed to streamline the Global Markets division, which is responsible for the sale and trading of financial instruments such as bonds and currencies. The division will be reorganized into three main areas: Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), Equities, and Prime Services.\nThe FICC division, which has been struggling in recent years due to lower trading volumes and increased competition from electronic trading platforms, will be split into two separate groups: Rates and Credit, and Macro. The Equities division, which has been performing better than the FICC division, will be expanded to include cash equities, equity derivatives, and structured products. The Prime Services division, which provides clearing and settlement services to hedge funds and other institutional clients, will remain unchanged.\nAccording to a statement issued by Barclays Investment Bank, the restructuring will \"position the firm for improved growth and profitability, while also enabling us to better serve our clients.\" The statement also noted that the new structure will allow the division to \"capitalize on emerging trends in the global financial markets.\"\nThe restructuring is part of a broader effort by Barclays Investment Bank to cut costs and increase profits. The division has been struggling to keep up with its rivals, particularly in the face of increased competition from smaller, more nimble firms. Barclays has also been hampered by regulatory challenges, as regulators have cracked down on risk-taking and proprietary trading.\nThe move comes as other investment banks have been making similar changes in response to the changing market environment. Goldman Sachs recently announced that it was merging its bond trading and interest rate swap trading operations, while JP Morgan has been cutting costs and streamlining its operations in an effort to boost profits.\nThe restructuring is also likely to lead to job losses, as the division seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency. While Barclays Investment Bank has not provided specific numbers, it is expected that several hundred jobs will be lost as a result of the restructuring.\nWhile the move is seen as a necessary step for Barclays Investment Bank to improve its performance and remain competitive, it is also likely to face criticism from some quarters. Unions and employee groups are likely to argue that the job losses are unnecessary, and that the bank should be doing more to protect its workers.\nOverall, the restructuring of the Global Markets division is a significant move for Barclays Investment Bank, as it seeks to navigate the rapidly changing financial markets. The move is likely to help the division to compete more effectively with its rivals, but it will also come at a cost, with job losses and other changes causing disruption for employees and customers alike.", "In recent weeks, Chinese soybean buyers have been defaulting on and cancelling contracts as international prices for the crop have fallen sharply. The move is causing concern among farmers, traders, and analysts as it raises fears of oversupply and further price declines.\nAccording to reports, Chinese buyers have been unable to take delivery of soybean cargoes due to a lack of storage space, slow customs clearance, and weaker domestic demand. As a result, they have either defaulted on their contracts or cancelled them altogether, causing widespread market disruption.\nThe situation has been exacerbated by the ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, which have led to reduced Chinese imports of US soybeans and increased purchases from other countries like Brazil and Argentina. This has put pressure on global soybean prices, which have fallen 15% over the past two months.\nThe fall in prices has been particularly hard on US farmers, who have seen demand from China decline sharply. Many farmers had planted soybeans with the expectation of selling to China, but that hope has been dashed as the trade war has dragged on.\nThe situation is also causing concern among traders and analysts, who fear that oversupply will further depress prices and hurt farmers. Currently, there are large quantities of unsold soybeans sitting in storage facilities across the world, and the cancellation of Chinese contracts will only add to this surplus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real mess right now,\u201d said Jim Sutter, CEO of the US Soybean Export Council. \u201cThe market needs to find a way to absorb all this supply, and that\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\nThe situation has led some to call for government intervention to help farmers and stabilize prices. However, others argue that market forces should be allowed to play out, and that farmers should adapt to the changing realities of the global market.\n\u201cFarmers need to be thinking more strategically and diversifying their crops,\u201d said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. \u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on one country or one crop anymore.\u201d\nDespite the challenges, some farmers and traders remain optimistic that the market will eventually rebound. They point to the long-term demand for soybeans in China, which is expected to grow as the country\u2019s middle class expands and shifts to a more protein-rich diet.\n\u201cThe Chinese market is too big to ignore,\u201d said Grant Kimberley, director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time before things turn around.\u201d\nIn the meantime, however, the situation remains uncertain. Chinese buyers are being cautious amid the trade tensions, and farmers are feeling the pinch as prices continue to fall. Ultimately, the fate of the soybean market will depend on how quickly the trade tensions between China and the US are resolved, and how quickly global demand for soybeans rebounds.\nUntil then, farmers and traders will be watching closely, hoping that the market will stabilize and that they can continue to supply the world\u2019s growing demand for this versatile and important crop.", "As U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed his focus on Asian foreign policy, experts cautioned against any potential conflict over Taiwan. Recent tensions have escalated between China and Taiwan, with China claiming the island as part of its territory, while Taiwan maintains its independence.\nThis renewed focus on Asia comes as the U.S. seeks to maintain its role as a global leader and counteract China's increasing power in the region. However, experts warn that any conflict involving Taiwan could lead to a major power struggle between the U.S. and China, with potentially catastrophic consequences for all involved.\n\"There is a tendency for the U.S. to view Taiwan as an ally in a larger conflict with China, but this is a dangerous mindset,\" says Dr. John Smith, a political science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Taiwan is a highly sensitive issue for China, and any perceived encroachment by the U.S. could easily escalate into a major conflict.\"\nPresident Clinton's renewed focus on Asia has largely been driven by economic interests and concerns over China's growing influence in the region. The U.S. is seeking to establish stronger trade ties with countries in the region, and has also been increasing its military presence there.\nHowever, experts caution that this could also provoke China into taking more aggressive actions, especially in regards to Taiwan. China has long maintained that Taiwan is part of its territory, and has never ruled out the use of military force to reclaim the island.\n\"The issue of Taiwan is not simply an economic or political matter, but is deeply rooted in China's national identity and territorial integrity,\" says Dr. Wei Zhang, a China expert at Harvard University. \"Any perceived threat to this could lead to a strong response from the Chinese government.\"\nMany experts also point out that any conflict over Taiwan would have major economic consequences for both the U.S. and China. Taiwan is a major player in the global technology industry, with many of the world's largest tech companies relying on Taiwanese suppliers.\nA conflict over Taiwan could disrupt global supply chains and cause significant economic damage. It could also lead to a major military conflict, with devastating consequences for all involved.\nGiven these risks, experts are urging President Clinton to tread carefully when it comes to Taiwan. They argue that the U.S. should focus on diplomacy and finding peaceful solutions to the issue, rather than escalating tensions with China.\n\"The U.S. needs to be very careful when it comes to Taiwan,\" says Dr. Smith. \"We need to be aware of China's concerns and try to find ways to address them without escalating the situation.\"\nThere are some signs that the U.S. is taking a more cautious approach to Taiwan. In recent months, the Biden administration has emphasized the importance of maintaining stability in the region, and has sought to engage with China on a number of issues.\nAt the same time, the administration has also been strengthening its military presence in the region, with several high-profile naval exercises in the South China Sea. This has raised concerns among some experts that the U.S. is trying to provoke China into a conflict over Taiwan.\nDespite these concerns, many experts remain optimistic that a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue can be found. They argue that diplomacy and open communication between the U.S. and China is key to avoiding any potential conflict.\n\"At the end of the day, everyone has a stake in maintaining peace and stability in the region,\" says Dr. Zhang. \"We need to focus on finding solutions that work for everyone, rather than escalating tensions and risking a major conflict.\"", "The Voisey's Bay nickel production project in Newfoundland, Canada is facing a significant setback due to environmental and Aboriginal pressures. The Innu Nation of Labrador and the Nunatsiavut Government have expressed concern over the company's proposed underground mining method, which involves the disposal of waste in a nearby lake. Additionally, the Newfoundland and Labrador Government has yet to approve the project's environmental impact assessment. The mining company, Vale, has acknowledged the concerns and is working to address them in consultation with Indigenous communities and government officials. The delay of the project's start date is inevitable due to the ongoing pressures.", "China announced on Monday that it will give Hong Kong courts new powers to handle trials of off-duty soldiers from its People's Liberation Army (PLA), thereby enhancing the legal authority of the semi-autonomous city.\nThis decision is a significant change in how China operates its military justice system in Hong Kong. Previously, any PLA soldier who committed a crime while off-duty would be tried in the mainland's military courts. However, the new measures will allow Hong Kong courts to take on these cases, except for ones related to national security or cases that PLA authorities deem to be \"special\" and, therefore, more sensitive.\nThe move comes as tensions between the Chinese military and Hong Kong residents are on the rise, particularly amid widespread protests against Beijing's imposition of a controversial national security law in the city. Critics of the law say that it undermines Hong Kong's autonomy and erodes the protections of basic human rights.\nUnder the new regulations, Hong Kong courts will not have jurisdiction over cases such as those related to military discipline, national defense, foreign exchanges, or when the PLA is executing its duties under government orders. Moreover, cases that involve sensitive information or might affect national security will not be eligible for Hong Kong courts.\nAdditionally, the Chinese military will still be responsible for maintaining the discipline of its troops stationed in Hong Kong, investigating allegations against soldiers and reporting its findings to the Hong Kong government.\nHong Kong's current legal system is based on a common law tradition, which is different from China's civil law system. The difference in legal systems has led to some concerns about how the new regulations will be implemented.\nThe Hong Kong Bar Association expressed optimism about the decision and said it would help clarify the legal processes for handling off-duty soldier trials. However, some legal experts worry that the new measures may not be enough to safeguard Hong Kong's autonomy.\nPreviously, the Chinese military stationed in Hong Kong has not been subject to local laws and has sometimes even refused to cooperate with local authorities. According to Hong Kong's Basic Law, the legal framework that defines the city's relationship with the mainland, the Chinese military's activities in Hong Kong must be approved by the local government.\nThis decision to empower Hong Kong courts to handle off-duty soldier trials has been praised by some as a step in the right direction towards greater autonomy for Hong Kong. Still, it will take some time to see how the new measures are implemented and whether they will help to alleviate some of the concerns about Chinese influence in Hong Kong's legal system.", "Russia\u2019s Fuel and Energy Ministry Struggles to Redefine Itself in New Market Economy, Analysts Say\nRussia\u2019s Fuel and Energy Ministry is facing significant challenges in the new market economy, and experts warn that changes are necessary for the ministry to remain relevant.\nThe ministry oversees Russia\u2019s vast oil and gas industry, which has long been the country\u2019s economic backbone. However, the global shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources has forced the ministry to confront a rapidly changing landscape.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s oil and gas industry is facing unprecedented challenges,\u201d said Alexei Miller, head of the state-owned energy company Gazprom. \u201cThe ministry needs to rethink its role in this new market.\u201d\nThe ministry has announced a number of initiatives to address these challenges, including increased investment in renewable energy, increased cybersecurity measures, and efforts to increase transparency and accountability.\nHowever, experts say that these initiatives do not go far enough, and that the ministry needs to fundamentally redefine itself in order to remain relevant.\n\u201cThere needs to be a fundamental shift in how the ministry thinks about its role in the energy industry,\u201d said Sergei Alexashenko, a former deputy finance minister and current senior fellow at the Moscow-based Carnegie Center. \u201cThis is a critical moment for the industry, and the ministry needs to lead the way forward.\u201d\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the ministry is the global shift towards renewable energy sources. While Russia\u2019s oil and gas industry remains strong, the growing popularity of renewable energy means that the demand for fossil fuels is likely to decline in the coming years.\nThis trend is particularly worrisome for Russia, which relies heavily on oil and gas exports to fuel its economy. The country ranks fourth in the world in terms of oil production and second in terms of natural gas production, and the industry accounts for a significant portion of the country\u2019s GDP.\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced a number of initiatives to promote renewable energy, including increased investment in wind and solar energy. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to keep pace with the changing energy landscape.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to be much more aggressive in promoting renewable energy,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a huge opportunity for Russia, but it requires a major shift in how the ministry thinks about its role.\u201d\nAnother challenge facing the ministry is cybersecurity. The increasing reliance on technology in the energy industry has made it more vulnerable to cyber attacks, and experts warn that the ministry needs to take steps to protect its infrastructure.\n\u201cWe are seeing more and more cyber attacks targeting the energy industry,\u201d said Vladimir Putin, president of Russia. \u201cThe ministry needs to take these threats seriously and take steps to protect our infrastructure.\u201d\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced plans to increase cybersecurity measures, including the creation of a national cybersecurity center. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to protect against the growing threat of cyber attacks.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to prioritize cybersecurity and make it a core part of its strategy,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a critical issue that cannot be ignored.\u201d\nFinally, the ministry is facing increasing pressure to increase transparency and accountability. The industry has long been associated with corruption and backroom deals, and experts say that the ministry needs to take steps to address these issues.\n\u201cThe energy industry is notorious for corruption and lack of transparency,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThe ministry needs to take steps to increase transparency and accountability, otherwise it will continue to lose credibility.\u201d\nTo address this challenge, the ministry has announced plans to increase transparency and accountability, including increased reporting requirements and the establishment of a public registry of energy industry contracts. However, experts say that these efforts are not enough to address the deep-seated corruption in the industry.\n\u201cThe ministry needs to be much more aggressive in addressing corruption,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThis is a huge issue that cannot be ignored.\u201d\nOverall, experts say that the ministry needs to fundamentally redefine itself in order to remain relevant in the new market economy. This will require a major shift in how the ministry thinks about its role, as well as a willingness to embrace change and innovation.\n\u201cThis is a critical moment for the energy industry,\u201d said Alexashenko. \u201cThe ministry needs to lead the way forward, or it risks being left behind.\u201d", "Toronto, Canada - The city of Toronto is bracing for a near-total shutdown as protesters take to the streets to voice their opposition against the proposed budget cuts. The demonstration follows the release of the city's 2021 budget, which includes significant cuts to various programs and services, including public health, affordable housing, and education.\nThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Toronto to demonstrate against the proposed budget cuts. The protesters consist of various groups, including educators, healthcare workers, low-income families, and indigenous peoples, who argue that they will be the most negatively impacted by these cuts.\nThe demonstration, which began peacefully, quickly turned violent as several groups of protesters broke away from the main group and began vandalizing public property. Protesters smashed windows of several businesses, and some even torched cars parked on the street. Police responded by trying to disperse the crowd with tear gas, but the violence continued.\nThe situation escalated as police tried to contain the riots, causing several injuries and arrests. Toronto Mayor John Tory addressed the situation in a press conference, calling on the protestors to remain peaceful. \"I understand that people are upset about the proposed budget cuts, but resorting to violence and vandalism is not the answer. I urge everyone to remain calm and express their frustration through peaceful means.\"\nThe proposed budget cuts have been met with widespread criticism from individuals and organizations across Toronto and Canada. Critics argue that the cuts will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable members of the community, including low-income families, seniors, and indigenous peoples.\nOne of the key cuts proposed in the budget is a reduction in public health funding, which includes a 10% cut to the city's public health budget. This cut is even more concerning as the city continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. The cuts also include a reduction in affordable housing funding and the closure of several community centers.\nThe proposed budget cuts have also raised concerns from educators, who argue that the cuts will lead to a reduction in education quality. The cuts include a reduction in funding for school boards, which will result in larger class sizes and reduced resources for students and teachers.\nCritics argue that the city's budget cuts are a result of poor government decision-making, and that the government should focus on finding alternative solutions to balance the budget. The proposed budget cuts also come at a time when the government has increased spending on several large-scale projects, including the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) expansion project.\nThe budget cuts have also raised concerns about the city's ability to bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has hit the city's economy hard, with many businesses struggling to stay afloat. The proposed budget cuts could further worsen the city's economic situation, leading to higher unemployment rates and reduced economic activity.\nIn response to the protests, the city's government has called for a dialogue with the protesters to discuss their concerns and find alternative solutions to the proposed budget cuts. However, the protesters have made it clear that they will not back down until the cuts are removed from the budget.\nThe situation in Toronto remains tense, with the city on the brink of a near-total shutdown. The proposed budget cuts have led to widespread anger and frustration, and it is clear that the city's government will need to find alternative solutions to balance the budget without negatively impacting the most vulnerable members of the community.\nIn the meanwhile, Toronto remains on edge, with the government and protesters locked in a standoff. The coming days will be crucial in determining the fate of the proposed budget cuts and the future of the city for years to come.", "British Energy Plc, the leading energy supplier in the United Kingdom, announced on Monday that it will make job cuts and introduce cost savings measures in a bid to boost profits. The move has been met with opposition criticism, with the opposition parties calling the decision'unacceptable'.\nThe company said that it plans to cut around 200 jobs across a range of functions, including management positions, in order to reduce its costs. The move is expected to save the troubled energy supplier around \u00a330 million annually.\nIn addition to job cuts, the company will introduce cost savings measures, which include reducing expenses on travel, consultants, and office space. This is part of the company's efforts to streamline its operations, which it says will help it compete in an increasingly challenging market.\nHowever, the move has been criticised by opposition parties, who argue that British Energy Plc should not be cutting jobs and making cost savings at a time when the UK is facing huge economic challenges. The Labour Party has called on the government to take action to protect jobs and support the energy sector during the current economic downturn.\nCommenting on the announcement, Labour MP Angela Eagle said: \"British Energy Plc's decision to cut jobs and introduce cost savings is unacceptable. The government must take urgent action to protect jobs in the energy sector and to support workers who are facing job losses during this difficult period.\"\nThe company has defended its decision, saying that it is necessary to implement these cost-saving measures to remain competitive in a challenging market. The company has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to a decrease in energy demand and a fall in energy prices.\nIn addition to the current economic challenges, British Energy Plc is also facing increasing competition from renewable energy suppliers, who are able to offer environmentally friendly and cost-effective energy alternatives to consumers.\nDespite the opposition's criticism, the company says that it remains committed to investing in renewable energy and reducing its carbon footprint. The company plans to invest over \u00a39 billion in renewable energy projects over the next five years, which it says will help it to meet the UK's ambitious carbon reduction targets.\nThe announcement of job cuts and cost savings comes as energy suppliers across the UK are facing increasing pressure to reduce their operating costs and to explore new ways of generating energy. British Energy Plc's decision is likely to be closely watched by other energy suppliers, who may follow suit by implementing similar cost-saving measures.", "As the telecom industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, analysts are predicting that media conglomerate News Corp could emerge as a clear winner from the recently announced merger between MCI (formerly known as WorldCom) and British Telecom (BT).\nThe $34 billion merger, which will create a global player in the telecommunications market, has raised several concerns among investors and analysts about its potential impact on competition, pricing, and market share. However, some experts believe that News Corp, which owns a portfolio of media properties including Fox News, the New York Post, and the Wall Street Journal, could benefit from the deal.\nOne of the main advantages for News Corp is the potential for increased advertising revenue from the combined customer base of MCI and BT, which consists of millions of businesses and consumers across the world. According to media analysts, the merger creates a significant opportunity for News Corp to expand its digital and mobile advertising offerings, as well as its content distribution capabilities.\n\"News Corp has a broad range of media properties that appeal to businesses and consumers, and this merger gives them access to a much larger audience,\" said Harry Marks, an analyst at Wall Street firm Bernstein. \"As more companies move their businesses online and adopt digital marketing strategies, News Corp is well-positioned to benefit from this shift.\"\nIn addition to advertising revenue, News Corp could also gain from increased content partnerships with the merged MCI-BT entity. With its expertise in news and entertainment content, as well as its strong digital presence, News Corp could be a valuable partner for the new telecom giant in delivering high-quality content to its customers.\nFurthermore, the merger could also help News Corp expand its international footprint, particularly in the European and Asian markets where MCI and BT have a significant presence. This could be particularly beneficial for the company's sports and entertainment properties, which have a global appeal and could benefit from increased exposure in new markets.\nHowever, some analysts caution that News Corp's potential gains are not without risks. The telecom industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and there is no guarantee that the merged entity will be successful in integrating its operations and maintaining market share.\nMoreover, News Corp faces challenges from the rise of digital competitors, such as Facebook and Google, which have disrupted the traditional media landscape and siphoned ad revenue away from legacy media companies. While News Corp has made efforts to diversify its revenue streams and invest in digital platforms, it still faces intense competition in the digital advertising market.\n\"Increasing advertising revenue is only part of the equation for News Corp,\" said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at City University of New York. \"They also need to focus on delivering high-quality content that resonates with their audience and distinguishes them from the competition.\"\nDespite these challenges, analysts remain bullish on News Corp's prospects in the wake of the MCI-BT merger. The company has a strong track record of navigating the tumultuous media landscape and adapting to changing market conditions, and it could emerge as a significant player in the telecom industry as a result of the merger.\n\"As the media and telecom industries continue to converge, there will be opportunities for companies that can offer a unique value proposition to customers,\" said Bernstein's Marks. \"News Corp has a lot to offer in terms of content, distribution, and digital capabilities, and the MCI-BT merger could be a catalyst for them to capitalize on these strengths.\"", "JAKARTA - Indonesia's capital market has taken a significant step forward after the country's regulator, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), issued new mutual fund regulations earlier this month. According to industry experts, these regulations are set to become a landmark for the local industry, and are expected to boost investor confidence in the country's mutual funds market.\nThe new regulations are aimed at increasing transparency and accountability across mutual funds in Indonesia. Under the new rules, mutual fund providers are required to provide more information about their funds, including their portfolio holdings, management fees, and performance data. This information will be made available to investors via online platforms, as well as through other channels.\nThe regulations also require mutual fund providers to implement stricter risk management systems, which will help to protect investors from the risks associated with investing in these funds. This includes the requirement for providers to conduct in-depth risk assessments of their portfolio holdings, as well as to implement procedures for monitoring and managing risk.\nAccording to experts, these regulations are a major step forward for Indonesia's mutual funds market, and will help to bring it more in line with international standards. This will be beneficial for both investors and the wider Indonesian economy, as it will help to attract foreign investment and promote growth in the financial sector.\nIn a statement, the OJK said that the new regulations were designed to \"strengthen the sustainability of the mutual fund industry, and encourage more investment, both domestically and internationally\". The regulator also noted that the regulations were based on international best practices, and had been developed in consultation with industry stakeholders.\nThe industry has welcomed the new regulations, with many providers hailing them as a major boost for the sector. \"These regulations are a landmark for the mutual fund industry in Indonesia,\" said Iwan Kurniawan, CEO of PT NTG Capital. \"They will help to increase transparency and accountability, and will provide investors with more confidence in the market.\"\nOther industry leaders echoed this sentiment, with many highlighting the potential benefits of the new regulations for the wider economy. \"These regulations will help to promote growth in the financial sector, and will attract more foreign investment into the country,\" said Hariadi Sukamdani, the Chairman of the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo).\nDespite the positive response, some analysts have highlighted the need for ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the new regulations to ensure their effectiveness. \"While these regulations are a step in the right direction, it is important that they are enforced and monitored effectively,\" said Dimas Seto, a capital markets analyst at Bank Mandiri. \"This will help to ensure that the market remains transparent and accountable, and that investors are protected.\"\nOverall, however, the mood in the mutual funds industry is optimistic, with many in the sector predicting a bright future for mutual funds in Indonesia. \"These regulations will help to place Indonesia's mutual funds market on a level playing field with other markets around the world,\" said Iwan Kurniawan. \"We believe that this will help to attract more investors and promote the development of the Indonesian economy.\"", "Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is set to acquire a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit as part of its ambitious growth strategy.\nThe Japanese insurer is expected to complete the acquisition of 51% of CIGNA Life Insurance Co. by the end of 2021, pending regulatory approval.\nYasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. aims to steer growth with the acquisition, as it enters into the health and life insurance sector along with its traditional property-casualty insurance business.\nThe move will also help CIGNA streamline its operations following a strategic review of its international insurance portfolios.\nCIGNA Life Insurance Co., which has roots in Japan dating back to 1987, provides various life and health insurance products, including individual life insurance, universal life insurance, and medical insurance.\nThe insurance unit has suffered some hit in recent years due to changes in financial regulations and low-interest rates.\nYasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. seeks to invigorate the unit with increased capital while taking advantage of the growing demand for health and life insurance among the country's aging population.\n\"As the Japanese market continues to evolve, we are excited to partner with CIGNA to offer a wider range of products to strengthen our customer experience and competitive advantage,\" said Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co.'s President and CEO, Akio Kiyotani.\nThe deal also marks the latest move in a wave of consolidation in the Japanese insurance industry driven by changing demographics and intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe deal follows Nippon Life Insurance's announcement in September 2020 that it would acquire 85% of the shares in MassMutual Japan Ltd., the Japanese unit of U.S.-based MassMutual Financial Group.\nThe acquisition by Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to enhance the company's position in the competitive insurance market, with CIGNA also benefiting from a considerable capital injection to enhance its operational efficiency.\nThe terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. Still, Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance Co. is expected to receive the financial backing required to grow its position in the Japanese insurance market better.", "Beijing, China - The joint venture between Volkswagen AG, the largest car manufacturer in Europe, and China's state-owned First Automotive Works (FAW) has denied reports about its possible closure, despite headwinds from the ongoing trade war.\nRecently, rumors surfaced that the German automaker's joint venture with FAW could be shut down for refusing to localize an electric car platform in China, which would make it harder for the company to compete with local rivals in the world's biggest auto market.\nHowever, in a statement released on Monday, Volkswagen-FAW said that it was \"untrue\" that the alliance's partnership faced the possibility of being dissolved.\n\"The reports are totally groundless. The joint venture is operating actively and orderly as always,\" the statement said, adding that it would \"continue its strategic partnership in China.\"\nDespite a challenging year for automakers, Volkswagen-FAW is performing relatively well. The company said it sold 2.28 million vehicles in China from January to October this year, up 0.7% compared to the same period last year.\nIt is worth noting that Volkswagen is a leading automaker in China, having sold over four million cars there in 2018. The German car giant also has joint ventures with two other Chinese carmakers, SAIC Motor Corp and JAC Motors.\nNonetheless, the auto industry is facing intense competition in the world's second-largest economy, as local players such as BYD Co, Geely Automobile Holdings, and BAIC Motor continue to ramp up their production of electric vehicles.\nTo cope with the shifting market landscape, Volkswagen-FAW has been building local production capacities and developing its electric vehicle technology. The joint venture also said earlier this year that it would invest around $2.5 billion in the development of new energy vehicles, and set a sales goal of one million such vehicles annually by 2025.\nDespite the ongoing trade war between China and the United States, Volkswagen-FAW's operations appear to be stable, with the company expressing optimism about its future prospects in the Chinese market.\n\"The joint venture will keep up with market changes and customer demand to bring more high-quality products to the Chinese market,\" the statement said.", "AT&T Struggles to Keep Up with Rivals in $75 Billion Long Distance Market\nAT&T, once the undisputed leader in the US long distance market, is struggling to keep up with its rivals in a sector that has grown into a $75 billion industry. The company has lost significant market share in recent years, as new technologies and aggressive competitors eat into its customer base.\nAccording to a recent report from research firm IBISWorld, the long distance market in the US has grown by 1.7% per year on average over the past five years, as increasing numbers of consumers turn to digital services like Skype and WhatsApp for their long distance calling needs. This has put pressure on traditional long distance carriers like AT&T, who are struggling to compete with the low prices and convenience of digital alternatives.\n\"The long distance market has changed dramatically in recent years,\" said Jim Bak, an analyst at IBISWorld. \"With the rise of digital services, consumers have more options than ever before. AT&T is struggling to keep up with this rapid pace of change, and as a result, is losing out to its competitors.\"\nAT&T's struggles in the long distance market can be attributed to a number of factors, including the rise of digital services and the aggressive pricing strategies of its rivals. Companies like Sprint and Verizon have been able to offer lower prices and more flexible plans, which has helped them to win customers away from AT&T.\nAnother factor is the increasing popularity of prepaid long distance plans. These plans allow customers to pay for their long distance calls in advance, which can be more cost-effective than traditional long distance plans. Many of AT&T's rivals have been quick to offer prepaid plans, which has helped them to attract price-sensitive customers who might otherwise have chosen AT&T.\nDespite these challenges, AT&T remains a major player in the long distance market, with a market share of around 25%. The company still offers a range of long distance plans, including unlimited plans for frequent callers and more affordable plans for occasional users.\nHowever, to stay competitive in the long distance market, AT&T will need to adapt to the changing needs and preferences of its customers. This means adopting new technologies and services, and offering more flexible pricing plans to attract and retain customers.\nOne area where AT&T is making progress is in the area of digital services. The company has launched its own video conferencing service, AT&T Video Meetings, which allows users to connect with colleagues and customers from anywhere in the world. The service has been well-received by customers, and has helped AT&T to compete more effectively with digital rivals like Skype and Zoom.\nAT&T is also investing heavily in its network infrastructure, in order to provide faster and more reliable long distance services. The company has rolled out 5G technology in several markets across the US, which has the potential to revolutionize the long distance market by offering faster speeds and lower latency.\nDespite these efforts, however, AT&T faces an uphill battle in the long distance market. Its rivals are continuing to invest in new technologies and services, and are aggressively pursuing new customers. If AT&T is to stay relevant in this highly competitive sector, it will need to be both nimble and innovative, and continue to put the needs of its customers first.", "The former U.S ambassador to China, Winston Lord, just completed a three-day visit to Beijing, China, where he held private and cordial talks with senior officials on the issues of human rights and North Korea's nuclear program.\nLord arrived in Beijing on Monday and held several closed-door meetings with Chinese officials. In an interview with the press, he described the talks as \"candid, constructive and cordial.\"\nDuring his stay in Beijing, Lord discussed with senior officials about the importance of human rights protection in China. He urged the Chinese government to release all political prisoners and stop the ongoing surveillance of activists.\n\"I have raised concerns about the current human rights situation in China, particularly the treatment of human rights activists, lawyers, and dissidents,\" Lord said.\nLord's visit came amid tensions between the U.S. and China over human rights issues and trade. The relationship between the two nations has been strained for some time, with the U.S. government accusing China of engaging in unfair trade practices.\nHowever, Lord's approach was a departure from the Trump administration's public criticism of China's human rights record. Rather than criticizing the country publicly, Lord decided to engage in private dialogue with Chinese officials.\n\"I think it's important to engage with the Chinese authorities in a constructive manner to try and effect positive change in this area,\" he said.\nLord also discussed the situation in North Korea, urging China to continue to leverage its influence on the reclusive regime to halt its nuclear program. North Korea has continued to defy international sanctions, and its leader, Kim Jong-un, has refused to abandon his country's nuclear program.\n\"China has a critical role to play in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. I have urged the Chinese authorities to continue their efforts to encourage the North Korean regime to denuclearize and engage in peaceful negotiations,\" Lord said.\nDespite the ongoing discussions, Lord's visit to China received little attention from the press. It is not clear if he met with President Xi Jinping, who recently concluded a meeting with President Trump in Florida.\nLord's visit comes ahead of other high-profile visits to China by U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Trump himself. Tillerson is scheduled to visit Beijing later this month to hold talks with Chinese officials on North Korea and trade.\nThe U.S. has been increasing pressure on China to take more decisive action to address North Korea's nuclear program. The Trump administration has said that all options are on the table when it comes to dealing with North Korea, including military action.\nMeanwhile, tensions between the two nations over trade continue to simmer. President Trump has accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices, including currency manipulation, intellectual property theft and dumping.\nLord's visit is seen as a significant step towards improving the relationship between the two countries. The veteran diplomat has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record, but he has also emphasized the importance of engagement and dialogue.\n\"As a former ambassador to China, I know how important it is to maintain constructive dialogue with the Chinese government, even when we have disagreements,\" Lord said.\nOverall, Lord's visit to Beijing was seen as a positive development in relations between the U.S. and China. With more high-profile visits scheduled in the coming weeks, it remains to be seen whether the two nations can work together to resolve their differences and improve their relationship.", "British Airways and Groupe Rivaud have made a joint bid for French regional airline Air Liberte.

With the advancement of technology, businesses can now easily expand their horizons and reach beyond their local markets. However, this has given rise to a new set of challenges, especially in terms of regulations and boundaries.\nThe growth of online commerce has brought new opportunities for businesses to thrive. Companies can now expand their reach to a global audience and offer their products and services to customers across the globe. However, this globalization of online commerce also brings regulatory complexities that companies must navigate in order to operate internationally.\nThe challenge for businesses today is to comply with the regulations and boundaries set by different countries. The internet has made it possible for companies to reach customers in different countries with ease. However, this has also created a situation where businesses have to comply with different regulations regarding taxes, data privacy, and intellectual property rights.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing businesses today is the issue of data privacy. Different countries have different laws regarding how businesses can collect, use, and protect personal data of their customers. This has made it difficult for companies to comply with regulations while operating on a global scale. In the European Union, for example, businesses have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is one of the strictest data privacy laws in the world. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines and reputational damage.\nAnother challenge for businesses operating globally is the issue of taxes. Different countries have different tax laws that businesses must comply with. This has created a situation where businesses have to comply with multiple tax codes and deal with different tax authorities. This is further compounded by the fact that many countries are now implementing digital taxes which target online commerce. It is essential for businesses to stay up-to-date on the latest tax regulations in different countries to avoid penalties and other legal issues.\nThe issue of intellectual property (IP) rights is also a significant challenge for businesses operating in different countries. Different countries have different IP laws that businesses must comply with. This can be a difficult task, especially for small businesses that do not have the resources to navigate the complex legal landscape. Failure to comply with IP laws can lead to legal action and significant financial damages.\nIn conclusion, the globalization of online commerce has brought many new opportunities for businesses to expand their reach. However, it has also created a complex regulatory landscape that companies must navigate. It is essential for businesses to stay up-to-date on the latest regulations in different countries and to comply with them to avoid penalties and other legal issues. This is especially important for small businesses that do not have the resources to navigate the complex legal landscape on their own. By working with legal experts and using modern technology solutions, businesses can overcome these challenges and continue to grow in the era of globalization.", "Shares of educational publishing giant Pearson have witnessed an unprecedented surge on the stock market, following speculation of a potential takeover bid from BSkyB. The news of the potential acquisition sent share prices soaring, as investors scrambled to get a piece of the action.\nAccording to market sources, rumours of a tie-up between Pearson and BSkyB have been circulating in recent weeks. Industry analysts suggested that a merger between the two companies would be mutually beneficial, with BSkyB looking to diversify into new markets and Pearson seeking to expand its digital offerings in the wake of declining print sales.\nHowever, both companies have remained tight-lipped on the issue, with no official confirmation or denial of the reports. This has led to further speculation and increased activity in the stock market, as investors continue to ponder the potential implications of such a deal.\nThe news of a possible takeover bid has also sparked debate among industry experts, who have expressed mixed opinions on the matter. Some argue that a merger between Pearson and BSkyB would create a powerful new player in the education market, with the ability to offer integrated digital solutions and access to a vast network of customers and resources.\nOthers, however, have raised concerns over the potential impact on competition and innovation, as well as the potential risks of integrating two companies with vastly different cultures and business models.\nDespite these concerns, many investors seem to be betting on a positive outcome for the proposed deal, with Pearson shares reaching their highest level since March 2020. The surge in share prices has also boosted the company's market value by over \u00a3500m, highlighting the potential benefits of a successful merger.\nThe education market has been undergoing significant changes in recent years, as the shift towards digital learning and e-books continues to accelerate. This has put pressure on traditional publishing companies like Pearson, which have struggled to adapt to the new demands of the market.\nIn response, the company has been investing heavily in digital offerings and restructuring its operations to better match the needs of today's students. The proposed merger with BSkyB would further bolster these efforts, providing Pearson with access to a wider audience and new digital tools to deliver education content.\nBSkyB, for its part, has been looking to diversify its business away from traditional TV and media offerings, as the streaming market becomes increasingly crowded. The education sector presents a logical new frontier for the company, with the potential to tap into a growing market and leverage its existing infrastructure and expertise in digital content delivery.\nDespite the potential benefits of a merger between Pearson and BSkyB, however, there are also plenty of risks associated with such a deal. Integration and cultural clashes are common challenges in any merger, and the education sector is no exception.\nThere is also the risk of antitrust concerns, as the new company would likely have a significant market share in the education sector. This could lead to regulatory hurdles and delays in the approval process, which could impact the overall success of the deal.\nNevertheless, investors and industry analysts seem bullish on the prospects of a Pearson-BSkyB merger, with many seeing this as a positive development for both companies. What remains to be seen, however, is whether the two sides can reach an agreement and navigate the challenges of integration to create a successful new player in the education sector.\nOverall, the Pearson-BSkyB takeover speculation has generated significant buzz in the market, with investors and industry insiders closely watching for any further developments. While there are certainly risks involved in such a deal, the potential benefits could be substantial, and could provide a much-needed boost for both companies in the evolving educational landscape.", "London-based real estate investment firm, Land Securities, has revealed that it has observed an uptick in rental growth across the UK property market. This news comes after a period of uncertainty as to whether the market would recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, which had a severe impact on property transactions and rental incomes alike.\nThe company's latest report showed a 3% increase in rental value growth in the six months leading up to September, with overall occupancy rates also increasing. Land Securities, which is the UK's largest commercial property company, primarily focuses on offices, shopping centers, and residential properties.\nThe firm's CEO, Mark Allan, stated that these results indicate \"the beginnings of a recovery\" in the market. He also acknowledged that the company's portfolio has taken a hit in terms of valuation due to the pandemic, but added that its balance sheet remains strong, allowing the firm to capitalize on buying opportunities that may arise in the coming months.\nHowever, Allan warned that the market is still vulnerable to the impact of changing government policies relating to Covid-19 and Brexit. He added that the firm would continue to monitor such developments closely to ensure that they are well-positioned to react accordingly.\nThe report also noted several key trends in the market, including a shift towards more flexible working arrangements and a growing demand for outdoor spaces in urban areas. The shift towards hybrid working models has led to increased demand for spaces that are adaptable to different working styles, with companies seeking more collaborative and informal spaces.\nAdditionally, there has been a growing trend towards outdoor spaces in urban areas, as people increasingly seek access to green spaces and fresh air. This has led to greater investment in public spaces such as parks and gardens, as well as the incorporation of outdoor spaces into commercial properties.\nThe report also highlighted the resilience of the logistics sector, which has seen increased demand due to the surge in online shopping. Land Securities has invested heavily in this sector, with holdings including distribution centers and warehouses. This has helped to offset some of the losses incurred in other areas of the portfolio.\nThe news of rental growth has been broadly welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a positive sign for the market. However, some have cautioned that the recovery is still fragile, given the ongoing uncertainty caused by the pandemic and Brexit.\nRichard Donnell, director of research and insight at property data analysis firm Zoopla, stated that the market remained \"volatile and sensitive\" to these factors, and that sustained growth would depend on a range of external factors. He added that the market was likely to remain subdued in the short term, with the true impact of the pandemic still largely unknown.\nDespite these challenges, many industry insiders remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the UK property market. With the increased investment in flexible working arrangements and outdoor spaces, as well as the continued growth of e-commerce, there are many opportunities for companies to capitalize on these trends and adapt to the changing needs of consumers.\nOverall, Land Securities' report provides a glimmer of hope for the market, showing that rental growth is possible even in the most challenging of circumstances. As the market continues to evolve, it will be important for companies to remain agile and adaptable, so that they can take advantage of the opportunities that this challenging environment presents.", "Sainsbury's, the British supermarket giant, has announced plans to launch a new bank in partnership with Bank of Scotland, as they look to expand their financial services offering. The new bank, which will be jointly owned by both companies, is expected to begin operations by the end of 2021.\nAccording to the announcement, the new bank will focus on providing a range of innovative and competitive financial products to Sainsbury's customers across the United Kingdom. It will offer everything from savings accounts and personal loans to credit cards and insurance products, with a particular focus on digital banking services.\n\"This is an exciting new chapter in our journey to offer our customers more choice and value in everything we do,\" said Simon Roberts, Sainsbury's CEO. \"We are delighted to be partnering with Bank of Scotland, a trusted and established institution with a strong track record in financial services.\"\nThe move is part of Sainsbury's broader strategy to expand its reach beyond the traditional supermarket sector and become a more diversified and integrated retailer. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the company has been looking for ways to adapt to changing consumer habits and preferences, with a greater focus on e-commerce and digital services.\n\"We know that our customers are increasingly looking for convenient and accessible ways to manage their finances,\" said Roberts. \"By launching this joint venture with Bank of Scotland, we can offer them a broader range of financial products and services than ever before.\"\nThe partnership between Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland is not the first of its kind in the UK. Several other supermarkets, including Tesco and Marks & Spencer, already operate their own banking services, with varying degrees of success. However, Sainsbury's hopes to bring a unique combination of convenience, customer service, and value to the market, setting itself apart from its competitors.\n\"We believe that Sainsbury's Bank can offer something truly different and compelling to customers,\" said Roberts. \"Our focus will be on delivering great value, innovative products, and outstanding customer service, all backed by the strength and credibility of Bank of Scotland.\"\nThe news has been well-received by industry experts, who have praised Sainsbury's for its strategic vision and bold move into the financial services sector.\n\"This is a smart move by Sainsbury's,\" said Paul O'Connor, Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors. \"Expanding its reach into banking gives the company a new source of revenue and a way to deepen customer relationships. It also highlights the growing importance of digital services in the retail sector, which will only become more valuable in the years ahead.\"\nWith the launch of its new banking services imminent, Sainsbury's is set to become an even more formidable player in the increasingly competitive retail landscape of the UK. As consumers continue to embrace digital services and e-commerce, the company's decision to diversify its offerings could prove to be a shrewd investment.", "Beijing, China \u2013 China has suspended imports of US chicken meat due to concerns about the spread of avian influenza, commonly known as fowl or bird flu, according to Chinese authorities on Thursday.\nThe ban, which takes effect immediately, will impact the multi-million dollar export business which has been growing steadily over the last few years. The US exported more than $1 billion worth of poultry meat to China in 2020, making it one of the top markets for US chicken imports.\nThe Chinese government's decision was based on their belief that bird flu could be transmitted through the import of frozen poultry meat and other products, posing a risk to humans. This concern has led to the ban.\nThe US poultry industry, which is the largest in the world, has been hit hard by the ban. The National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, estimates the move will cut US poultry exports to China by up to 30%.\nThe council has called on US officials to work with their Chinese counterparts to resolve the issue quickly. \"We're disappointed with China's decision and we're working closely with the US government to resolve this issue,\" said Ashley Peterson, Senior Vice President of the National Chicken Council.\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has reassured consumers that US chicken is safe to eat and that the agency will continue to work with Chinese authorities to lift the ban. \u201cUSDA is committed to ensuring the safety and health of our food supply and the protection of both US and foreign consumers,\u201d said the agency in a statement.\nAccording to the USDA website, the export of US chicken to China was gradually increasing since 2013. The US poultry industry had been capitalizing on China\u2019s move to lift a ban on US chicken imports in 2013, after more than a decade of exclusion following an outbreak of bird flu in the US.\nAvian Influenza has been a serious concern for China in recent years. In 2020, the country reported several bird flu outbreaks in various areas, including an outbreak of H5N8 bird flu at a poultry farm in Qinghai Province. The virus is highly contagious among birds and can lead to human fatalities.\nChina is still coping with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic stemming from early 2020, and the year-long ban on poultry imports may weigh on the country's domestic supply. China has also banned poultry imports from other countries in the past citing bird flu concerns.\nThe ban comes as tensions between the US and China continue to rise, with both countries locked in a trade war, and amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The US poultry industry had benefited from the Phase 1 trade deal that was signed between the US and China in January 2020, under which China agreed to import an additional $200 billion of US goods and services.\nThe impact of this ban is not just on the US poultry industry but also on the Chinese consumers of chicken meat. According to reports, China represents the world's largest market for chicken meat consumption and the country has been importing frozen chicken meat to meet its growing domestic demand.\nThe suspension of US chicken imports also comes at a time when China is facing food supply chain disruption due to African swine fever decimating the country's pig population. This has led to a surge in demand for alternative protein sources, including chicken meat.\nThe ban may push China to explore alternative sources of protein, such as Brazilian chicken, which could be problematic for the US poultry industry, as China was the second-largest market for US poultry exports after Mexico.\nThe US and China have been in a trade war for almost two years now. The ban on US chicken imports is another example of how trade tensions between the two countries are affecting businesses and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.", "Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has withdrawn from the Czech Indoor Open due to a wrist injury. The 52-year-old German tennis legend was set to play in the doubles tournament alongside junior partner, Czech Republic's Jiri Vesely.\nBecker, who won six Grand Slam singles titles between 1985 and 1996, had been experiencing discomfort in his right wrist which he sustained from a fall earlier this month. He was advised by his doctors to rest and rehabilitate the injury which meant he had to withdraw from the upcoming tournament.\nIn a statement, Becker said, \"I'm naturally disappointed not to play in the Czech Indoor Open. The event holds a special place in my heart, and I was looking forward to partnering with Jiri Vesely. However, my health is of the utmost importance, and I need to allow my wrist ample time to heal.\"\nThe Czech Indoor Open, which runs from 19th to 25th October, is a popular ATP Tour event held annually in the Czech Republic. The tournament is part of the ATP Tour 250 series and attracts some of the world's best tennis players.\nBecker's withdrawal from the tournament is a significant blow to the event's organisers as he remains a crowd favourite and one of the biggest draws for the fans. Despite this setback, the organisers remain optimistic that the tournament will still attract top-class players in the absence of Becker.\nThe German legend has been serving as a tennis commentator and analyst for the BBC since retiring from professional tennis. He is considered one of the best tennis players of all time and is credited with revolutionising the sport with his fast-paced and aggressive play.\nBecker's fans will be hoping for a speedy recovery and his return to the tennis court as soon as possible.", "Amcor Ltd, the Australian global packaging company, is expected to report a heavy slump in its annual profit. However, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future recovery, as it deals with operational challenges, market shifts, and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China.\nAccording to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg, Amcor is likely to report a 12.5% decline in net income to $302.5 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. This drop is mainly due to several one-time costs, including restructuring charges related to the acquisition of US-based rival Bemis Co, which was completed in June 2019.\nThe integration of Bemis has proved to be a challenging process for Amcor, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the company's supply chain and reduced demand for certain products. In May, Amcor announced that it would close four Bemis facilities in the US and cut a total of 500 jobs, as part of its efforts to streamline operations and improve profitability.\nAmcor's results will also reflect the impact of weakening demand and fierce competition in the global packaging market, as well as the tariffs imposed by the US on Chinese goods since 2018. The trade tensions between the two countries have disrupted global trade flows, raised import costs, and caused uncertainty for businesses.\nDespite these headwinds, analysts believe that Amcor has a strong position in the packaging industry and is well-equipped to weather the current challenges. The company operates in 40 countries and serves a wide range of sectors, including food, beverage, healthcare, and personal care. It also has a solid track record of innovation, sustainability, and cost efficiency.\nMoreover, Amcor is expected to benefit from a shift towards sustainable packaging and e-commerce, which have accelerated during the pandemic. Consumers are increasingly demanding eco-friendly and convenient packaging solutions, while online retailers require more durable and protective packaging to cope with the rising volumes of shipments.\nAmcor has responded to these trends by launching several sustainable packaging products, such as the Greenlist program, which evaluates and improves the environmental performance of its materials and processes. The company has also expanded its e-commerce portfolio, with new products such as the e-Cube, a lighter and more space-efficient box designed for online orders.\nIn addition, Amcor has committed to reducing its carbon footprint and waste generation, by setting ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and recycling. The company aims to achieve 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025 and to reduce its carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030.\nThese initiatives are likely to enhance Amcor's competitiveness, profitability, and sustainability in the long term, according to analysts. They expect the company's earnings to rebound in the next fiscal year, as the Bemis acquisition benefits start to materialize, the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and the global economy recovers.\n\"We remain positive on Amcor's outlook, given its strong market position, innovation capabilities, and sustainable product offerings,\" said Richard Jones, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"We see upside potential in the stock, as the market recognizes Amcor's long-term growth prospects and resilience.\"\nAmcor's shares have gained 7.5% this year, outpacing the 2.7% rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index. The stock closed at $15.46 on Friday, with a market capitalization of $20.7 billion. The company is expected to report its full-year results on August 17.", "BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster has denied speculations regarding its plans to bid for Pearson, the London-based publishing company. The denial comes after rumors of BSkyB's interest in Pearson had hit the market, increasing the value of Pearson's shares by over 8% on Monday.\nThe news of the acquisition bid surfaced in The Sunday Times, which reported that BSkyB had hired advisers to examine a potential \u00a39bn ($12bn) takeover bid of Pearson. However, BSkyB was quick to deny any intention of such an acquisition. In a statement, BSkyB stated that they \"routinely consider various acquisitions and divestments,\" but they were categorically denying any plans for a takeover of Pearson.\"\nOn Monday, Pearson's shares went up by around 8.3% to 784.2p, valuing the company at \u00a39.3bn ($12.2bn), its highest level in three years. This reflected the investors' view that Pearson would be an attractive acquisition target, particularly given its recent restructuring and job cuts as part of efforts to adapt to tougher market conditions.\nPearson is the world's largest education company and the owner of the Financial Times newspaper. However, in recent years, its profitability has been challenged due to a decline in print revenues and significant technology disruption in the education industry. The company has responded by revamping its focus on digital education products, selling off non-core assets, and cutting thousands of jobs.\nBSkyB, on the other hand, is a satellite broadcaster that has transformed into a major producer of TV content in recent years. It has been expanding internationally and adding to its own portfolio of program commissions, such as Riviera and Jamestown. The company is owned by US media giant Comcast, which acquired it in late 2018 in a deal worth \u00a330bn ($39bn).\nMany investors see the potential acquisition of Pearson by BSkyB as a logical move. Pearson's education-focused assets, when combined with BSkyB's offerings, could create a powerful presence in the education media space. Pearson's recent pivot toward digital education content is also well-aligned with the online video market that BSkyB has been expanding into in recent years.\nThis acquisition would also expand the scope of BSkyB's offerings, potentially placing them in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Apple TV. Another driver of the acquisition could be the fact that Pearson, the Financial Times' parent, would give BSkyB an entryway into the financial media world, which could be lucrative.\nHowever, the proposed takeover would face many obstacles. Some analysts believe that the UK government would be unlikely to approve the deal due to media ownership regulations. Also, it is uncertain whether Pearson's board would be willing to sell the company. Furthermore, there could be other interested bidders, potentially driving up the price of the acquisition.\nDespite the uncertainty, there is no doubt that BSkyB's denial of the acquisition has disappointed some investors who saw the acquisition as an attractive proposition. They may also have been hoping for a repeat of Comcast's acquisition of Sky in 2018, which saw a bidding war with Fox that ultimately led to Sky becoming part of the Comcast empire.\nFor now, the speculation has caused an increase in the value of Pearson's shares, but only time will tell whether a deal will ever materialize.", "The Big Three U.S. Automakers \u2013 General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler \u2013 are poised to see nearly $2 billion profits in the third quarter of 2021. This is after a turbulent year in which the pandemic brought production to a standstill and caused significant financial losses for the auto industry.\nGeneral Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, is expected to report a profit of $1.8 billion for the quarter, up from $2.5 billion in the previous year. The company has benefitted from strong demand for its trucks and SUVs, particularly in the North American market. In addition, GM has been able to offset the impact of higher commodity prices by implementing cost-saving measures.\nFord, the second-largest automaker, is expected to post a profit of $1 billion, up from $436 million in the previous year. The company has also seen strong demand for its trucks and SUVs, as well as the new Ford Bronco, which has been a hit with consumers. In addition, Ford has been able to reduce costs by restructuring its operations and focusing on its core products.\nFiat Chrysler, which recently merged with French automaker PSA to form Stellantis, is expected to report a profit of $124 million for the quarter. This is down from $1.4 billion in the previous year, but still a solid result given the challenges faced by the industry. Stellantis has been able to benefit from strong demand for its Jeep brand, as well as cost-saving measures implemented as part of the merger.\nThe strong performance of the Big Three automakers reflects the broader recovery of the U.S. economy, which has been bolstered by government stimulus measures and a rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations. In addition, low interest rates have encouraged consumers to purchase new vehicles, particularly larger models that generate higher profits for automakers.\nHowever, there are also challenges on the horizon. The global shortage of semiconductor chips continues to impact the auto industry, leading to production slowdowns and backlogs of orders. In addition, concerns over inflation and supply chain disruptions could create headwinds for the industry in the coming months.\nDespite these risks, the Big Three automakers are cautiously optimistic about the future. GM recently announced plans to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles by 2025, with the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040. Ford and Stellantis also have ambitious plans to transition towards electric vehicles, as well as to develop new mobility services and technologies.\nThe shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles represents a major opportunity for the auto industry, as well as for the broader economy. The transition is expected to create millions of jobs in areas such as battery production, charging infrastructure, and software development. It could also have significant environmental benefits, as electric vehicles produce fewer emissions than traditional cars and trucks.\nHowever, the transition will not be without its challenges. Electric vehicles currently represent a small fraction of total vehicle sales, and it will take time for consumers to adapt to the new technology. In addition, the development of autonomous vehicles is still in its early stages, and there are significant legal and regulatory hurdles that will need to be overcome.\nThe Big Three automakers are well-positioned to navigate these challenges, given their size, scale, and experience. They also have a strong track record of innovation and adaptation, having weathered numerous disruptions over the past century.\nIn conclusion, the expected $2 billion profits for the Big Three U.S. Automakers in the third quarter of 2021 is a sign of the industry\u2019s resilience and recovery. However, the challenges facing the industry are significant, and the transition towards electric and autonomous vehicles represents a major opportunity and a major risk. It will be important for the auto industry, policymakers, and consumers to work together to ensure a smooth and successful transition towards a more sustainable and innovative future.", "GTE Corp, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the United States, announced on Monday that it expects to continue increasing its earnings per share (EPS) by at least 10% for the foreseeable future. This is due to the company's rising revenues, which were fueled by its recent acquisition of several smaller companies.\n\"We are very pleased with the progress we have made over the past year,\" said GTE CEO Richard Notebaert. \"Our strong financial performance is a result of our focus on customer service and our commitment to investing in our network and technology infrastructure.\"\nGTE reported earnings of $2.10 per share in the third quarter, up from $1.85 per share in the same period last year. The company's revenue also increased to $33.8 billion in the quarter, up from $31.2 billion in the same period last year.\n\"The third quarter results were very strong,\" said Notebaert. \"We saw growth across all of our business segments, and we are confident that we will continue to see strong growth going forward.\"\nGTE's recent acquisition of several smaller companies has helped boost its revenue growth. In June, the company announced that it had acquired Internet service provider MCI Communications for $37 billion. The deal gave GTE control of one of the largest Internet backbones in the world and expanded its customer base.\n\"We are excited about the opportunities that the MCI acquisition has created for us,\" said Notebaert. \"We now have a broader portfolio of services to offer our customers, and we are seeing strong demand for these services.\"\nGTE has also been investing in its network and technology infrastructure in order to better serve its customers. The company has been rolling out new fiber-optic networks in major metropolitan areas, which offer faster Internet speeds and better connectivity.\n\"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service,\" said Notebaert. \"That means investing in our network and technology infrastructure to ensure that we can deliver fast, reliable service to all of our customers.\"\nAnalysts are bullish on GTE's future prospects, citing the company's strong financial performance and its focus on customer service.\n\"GTE has done a great job of executing on its strategic goals,\" said analyst Michael Rollins. \"The company has a solid customer base and a strong infrastructure, which should continue to drive growth going forward.\"\nRollins also noted that GTE's focus on customer service has helped set it apart from its competitors.\n\"Customer service is becoming increasingly important in the telecommunications industry,\" said Rollins. \"GTE has done a great job of focusing on this area, which should help it continue to attract and retain customers.\"\nDespite its strong financial performance, GTE faces several challenges going forward. The company is facing increased competition from other telecommunications companies, as well as regulatory scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\"The telecommunications industry is highly competitive, and GTE will need to continue to innovate in order to stay ahead of its competitors,\" said Rollins. \"The FCC is also keeping a close eye on the industry, which could lead to more regulation in the future.\"\nDespite these challenges, GTE remains optimistic about its future prospects. The company has a strong customer base and a solid infrastructure, which should continue to fuel growth going forward.", "Ford Motor Company and the Detroit Lions are reportedly in talks over a multi-million dollar naming rights agreement for the Lions' new stadium currently under construction in downtown Detroit. Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the deal could be worth up to $150 million over a 20 year term.\nThe new stadium is expected to be the centerpiece of a revitalized downtown area and is scheduled to open in 2022. It will replace the Lions' current home at Ford Field which opened in 2002 and seats just over 65,000 fans. Details of the new stadium's capacity, design and features have not yet been made public.\nIf completed, the deal would be the latest in a string of high-profile sports naming rights agreements between auto manufacturers and professional sports franchises, with recent examples including Mercedes-Benz's naming rights for the Atlanta Falcons' Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Audi's deal with Major League Soccer's D.C. United for Audi Field.\nRepresentatives of Ford and the Detroit Lions declined to comment on the reports of a naming rights deal, citing ongoing negotiations. However, both parties have previously expressed a desire to expand their partnership, with Ford already serving as the Lions' official vehicle since 2014.\nThe potential partnership would not only bring in significant revenue for both Ford and the Lions, but it would also create a strong Detroit-based branding opportunity that could reiterate the recent resurgence of the city as a major economic player in the United States.\nThe new Detroit stadium naming deal is yet to be finalised. Still, the possibility is already generating excitement among fans, businesses and city leaders alike. Detroit's recent revitalisation, coupled with Ford's long history in the city, has set the stage for a truly significant partnership that could benefit both the automaker and the city for years to come.", "The European Parliament has awarded Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for his outstanding contribution towards upholding human rights and democracy in China. Beijing, however, called it a \"rude interference\" in its internal affairs and warned of consequences.\nWei Jingsheng is a renowned human rights activist who has been a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party and its policies for over four decades. He is best known for his role in the Democracy Wall movement of 1978, where he wrote articles advocating for political reform and democracy in China. For his activism, he was arrested in 1979 and spent 18 years in prison, where he was subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment.\nSince his release in 1997, Wei has continued to speak out against the CCP's human rights abuses, censorship, and suppression of dissent. He has advocated for the rights of ethnic minorities, including Tibetans and Uighurs, and has called for an end to the one-party rule in China.\nThe Sakharov Prize, named after the Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov, is awarded annually by the European Parliament to individuals or groups who have made significant contributions to the promotion of human rights and democracy. The prize is considered one of the most prestigious accolades in the field of human rights.\nThe selection of Wei Jingsheng for the Sakharov Prize this year has been met with mixed reactions. While human rights organizations and activists have welcomed the decision, the Chinese government has criticized it as a \"rude interference\" in its internal affairs.\nIn a statement, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, \"We firmly oppose any country or organization to use the issue of human rights to interfere with China's internal affairs.\"\nThe Chinese embassy in Brussels also expressed its displeasure with the decision, saying, \"We urge the European Parliament to respect China's sovereignty and refrain from undermining China-EU relations by awarding such a prize.\"\nMeanwhile, human rights organizations have praised the European Parliament's decision to honor Wei Jingsheng. Sophie in't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, said, \"Wei Jingsheng represents the best of China, the will to resist repression and defend human rights. Awarding him with the Sakharov Prize is an important show of solidarity.\"\nHuman Rights Watch also welcomed the decision, saying, \"The European Parliament has sent a strong message that the world is watching as China continues to crack down on those who seek to promote freedom, democracy, and human rights.\"\nWei Jingsheng, who lives in the United States, expressed his gratitude for the award, saying, \"I hope this award will inspire more people to stand up for their rights and freedoms, and to work towards a democratic future for China.\"\nThe Chinese government's response to the Sakharov Prize for Wei Jingsheng is indicative of its growing hostility to outside criticism and interference. China has faced international criticism for its treatment of ethnic minorities, its suppression of dissent, and its crackdown on civil society.\nThe European Union has been particularly vocal in its condemnation of China's human rights record, with officials calling for an independent investigation into the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang province and criticising Beijing's new security law in Hong Kong.\nThe awarding of the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jingsheng is a reminder that the international community remains committed to upholding human rights and democracy, despite China's attempts to silence its critics.", "Beijing has offered assurances to Taiwan regarding the island's security following the lift of a direct trade ban. The move, which has been a long-standing issue between the two sides, is expected to boost economic ties but has raised concerns over Taiwan's security.\nChina's State Council announced last week that it would end the ban on direct trade between China and Taiwan. The ban, which was introduced in 2000, had required Taiwan businesses to go through Hong Kong or other third-party countries to trade with China. The ban was seen as a way for Beijing to exert pressure on Taiwan, which it considers a breakaway province.\nTaiwanese officials had expressed concerns that lifting the ban would make the island more vulnerable to China's influence and coercion. Taiwan has been a self-governing democracy since 1949, but China has been keen to reunify it with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve that goal. Beijing has also stepped up its military activities around Taiwan, including sending fighter jets and aircraft carriers near the island.\nHowever, Chinese officials have sought to allay these fears, saying that the trade agreement would not compromise Taiwan's security. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that the agreement \"will not harm the interests of Taiwanese businesses or workers\" and that \"it will not affect Taiwan's security.\"\nWang also reiterated Beijing's stance on the \"one China\" principle, which states that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part. He said that \"the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair and concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and that \"Taiwan independence is a dead end.\"\nDespite the reassurances from Beijing, many Taiwanese remain skeptical. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said that it would \"actively evaluate\" the agreement and would \"take all necessary measures to safeguard the nation's security and interests.\" Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen has also said that the island would \"remain steadfast in defending our democracy and freedom\" and would not bow to pressure from Beijing.\nIn the United States, which has long been a supporter of Taiwan's democracy, there are also concerns over the agreement. A State Department spokesman said that the US has \"long been clear that we support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the international community\" and that any steps taken by China to suppress Taiwan's international presence would be met with \"strong opposition.\"\nThe US has also been stepping up its military presence in the region in response to China's increasing assertiveness. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have both visited Japan and South Korea, where they reaffirmed the US commitment to regional security and stressed the importance of the US alliances with those countries.\nThe lift of the direct trade ban between China and Taiwan is a significant development in the relationship between the two sides. While it is expected to boost economic ties, it has also heightened concerns over Taiwan's security and sovereignty. Beijing's assurances may have eased some of those concerns, but many Taiwanese remain wary of China's intentions. As the US and other regional powers continue to monitor the situation, the focus will remain on how the agreement will play out in practice and whether it will lead to greater cooperation or greater tensions between China and Taiwan.", "Two of the UK's insurance broking giants \u2013 Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings and Fenchurch Plc \u2013 have announced plans to merge their operations in an effort to offset declining margins. The merger would create one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the country, with a combined workforce of over 800 people.\nThe decision to merge comes amid growing concerns in the insurance sector about falling margins due to increased competition and regulatory pressures. Firms have been struggling to maintain profitability, as lower premiums and higher claims payouts have squeezed their margins.\n\"To succeed in today's challenging market environment, insurers must find ways to generate higher margins while keeping costs under control,\" said James Maxwell, CEO of Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings. \"By joining forces with Fenchurch Plc, we can leverage our scale and expertise to achieve greater efficiencies and economies of scale.\"\nThe merger is expected to help the firms reduce their operating costs by consolidating their back-office functions and reducing duplicate services. This cost-cutting move is expected to result in significant savings, which will be passed on to clients in the form of lower premiums and better coverage.\nBoth firms have a strong reputation in the insurance industry, with a focus on providing high-quality service to clients across a range of sectors, including property and casualty, healthcare, and financial lines. The merger is expected to strengthen the firms' capabilities in these areas and allow them to offer a wider range of products and services to clients.\n\"The merger of Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings and Fenchurch Plc is a natural fit, as both firms share a commitment to excellence in client service and a focus on innovation and growth,\" said Fiona Stewart, CEO of Fenchurch Plc. \"We believe the combination of our resources, expertise, and best practices will allow us to deliver even better results for our clients.\"\nThe merger is subject to regulatory approval, but both firms expect to complete the process by the end of the year. The new company will be headquartered in London and led by a management team drawn from both firms.\n\"This is an exciting time for our industry, with significant challenges and opportunities ahead,\" said Maxwell. \"By combining the strengths of two leading firms, we believe we can create a powerful force in the insurance market and deliver real value to our clients.\"", "Lloyd's Insurance Market has received a favorable ruling from the U.S. District Court, which has allowed the market to extend its recovery plan deadline.\nThe court ruling comes as welcome news for Lloyd's, which has been working to rebuild its reputation and financial standing after suffering significant losses in recent years. The insurance market had set a target of returning to profitability by 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown a wrench into its plans.\nFortunately, the court ruling has allowed for a more flexible timetable for Lloyd's to meet its financial targets. The extension gives the market more time to implement its recovery plan while navigating the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic.\nLloyd's Chief Executive Officer, John Neal, expressed gratitude for the ruling and noted that the market continues to make progress towards achieving its goals.\n\"We are pleased with the court ruling, which recognizes the progress we have made in implementing our recovery plan,\" Neal said. \"We remain fully committed to returning Lloyd's to profitability and delivering long-term sustainable value to our customers and investors.\"\nThe extension will also give Lloyd's more time to address some of the structural issues that have contributed to its financial struggles. One of the key issues that the market has faced is the high cost of doing business, which has made it hard for Lloyd's to compete with other insurance providers.\nIn response, Lloyd's has launched a number of initiatives aimed at reducing costs, including a plan to streamline its syndicate structure and reduce the number of underwriters it employs. The market has also been exploring new ways to use technology to improve efficiency and make it easier for customers to do business with Lloyd's.\nDespite these challenges, there are signs that Lloyd's is making progress towards its goals. The market has seen improvements in its underwriting performance, and it has been able to attract new investors.\nThe court ruling is likely to provide some much-needed relief for Lloyd's, which has faced significant financial pressure in recent years. The insurance market suffered a loss of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) in 2018, and it has struggled to recover since then.\nThe pandemic has only added to the market's troubles, as it has led to an increase in claims and a decrease in business activity. However, Lloyd's has been proactive in responding to these challenges and has put in place measures to support its customers and partners.\nMoving forward, Lloyd's will continue to focus on implementing its recovery plan, streamlining its business operations, and finding new ways to provide value to its customers. The court ruling is a positive step in the right direction, and it provides the market with the flexibility it needs to navigate the uncertain economic landscape.\nWith a renewed focus on innovation, cost reduction, and customer service, Lloyd's is well-positioned to overcome its challenges and emerge as a stronger and more resilient insurance market.", "Pharmacy chain corporation, Revco Drug Stores Inc. (Revco D.S.), has announced its decision to acquire Big B for $380 million. The move comes as Revco D.S. aims to expand its footprint in the mid-western United States, where Big B has established a considerable presence over the years.\nRevco D.S. has had its fair share of problems in the past, which has affected its financial performance. However, this acquisition marks the corporation's efforts to overcome those difficulties and propel growth in the future. With the purchase of Big B, Revco D.S. stands to gain access to a larger customer base and increase its revenue and profits.\nThe acquisition will give Revco D.S. ownership over Big B's 200 stores across Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, with more than 5,000 employees. The acquisition will also add more than $1 billion in annual sales to Revco's figures. This, in turn, will improve its position in the competitive pharmacy market, where it faces stiff competition from larger chains like CVS and Walgreens.\nSources close to the transaction have said that the deal was inevitable as Big B had been looking for a buyer for some time. Revco D.S. was the natural choice since the corporation already had a presence in the areas that Big B operates in. The two companies' values overlap, with a strong focus on customer service and the provision of quality healthcare. This deal, therefore, is expected to be a seamless and mutually beneficial transition.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Jeff Poore, Revco's CEO, will assume the role of CEO of the combined entity. Poore has expressed his excitement at the opportunity to continue providing healthcare solutions to the communities the combined entity serves.\n\"We are thrilled about the acquisition of Big B and the opportunities it presents for us to grow and continue providing excellent patient care to more communities,\" Poore said. \"Both Revco and Big B share the same commitment to putting our customers first, and this acquisition will enable us to serve more customers and provide them with affordable, quality healthcare services.\"\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed in the next six months, subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Once the deal is closed, Revco D.S. will make significant changes in the operations of the rebranded stores. The stores will be revamped to reflect Revco's brand identity, with new signage and dedicated pharmaceutical products.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Big B by Revco D.S. for $380 million marks an exciting new chapter for the pharmacy chain corporation. The move is expected to strengthen its position in the competitive pharmacy market and significantly increase its revenue. Revco D.S. is optimistic about the future and remains committed to providing quality healthcare services to the communities it serves. The corporation is confident that this acquisition will be transformative and contribute significantly to its growth and success in the coming years.", "Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd has reported strong interim results, thanks to the drop in raw material prices. Despite the ongoing economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the cashmere products manufacturer has managed to grow its business by taking advantage of lower cost inputs.\nAccording to the company's financial statement for the first half of 2021, its revenue rose 28.5% to 4.53 billion yuan ($699 million) compared to the same period last year, while net profit surged 175.6% to 517.5 million yuan ($79.8 million). The company said that the increase was mainly due to the decline in the cost of raw materials such as cashmere, wool, and camel hair.\nInner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd is a leading Chinese maker of cashmere fabrics, garments, and accessories, supplying major brands such as Burberry, Armani, and Max Mara. The company sources its raw materials from Inner Mongolia, where the world's best cashmere is produced. However, the cost of cashmere has been declining for several years due to oversupply and weak consumer demand.\nThe pandemic has worsened the situation, with the global fashion industry suffering a severe downturn as people have reduced their spending on non-essential items. This has forced cashmere farmers to sell their products at lower prices, which has benefited manufacturers like Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd.\nThe company has also focused on reducing production costs and increasing efficiency, which has helped it to maintain profitability even in difficult market conditions. It has invested in new technologies and processes to streamline operations and improve the quality of its products.\nIn addition, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd has expanded its product lines and marketing channels to reach more customers. It has launched new collections of cashmere clothes and accessories, targeting younger and fashion-conscious consumers. It has also increased its online sales and social media presence, which has helped it to reach a wider audience.\nThe company expects to continue its growth trajectory in the second half of 2021, as demand for cashmere products is expected to recover as the global economy recovers from the pandemic. However, it cautioned that the volatility of raw material prices could affect its financial performance in the future.\nOverall, Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Products Co Ltd's strong interim results demonstrate its resilience and adaptability in a challenging business environment. Its ability to take advantage of market opportunities and innovate its business model could serve as a model for other companies struggling in the current economic climate.", "Washington D.C. - The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Tuesday that it is erasing a Depression-era rule that governed the rates that long-distance phone companies could charge each other. The decision is part of the agency\u2019s efforts to modernize regulations and provide a more conducive environment for competition.\nThe rule, which was put in place in 1934, required long-distance phone companies to charge each other the same rate for using each other\u2019s networks. Advocates for the rule argued that it prevented larger companies from using their market dominance to cut off competition by charging higher rates to independent carriers or simply refusing to connect their networks to those of potential competitors. But critics of the rule, including many in the telecom industry, argued that it created distortions in the market and discouraged innovation.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the rule is likely to provoke both criticism and praise from different quarters. Supporters of the measure say that it will clear the way for more innovation in the telecom industry and allow newer, smaller companies to gain a foothold. They also argue that the move will help bring down prices for consumers and businesses.\nOne telecom industry insider praised the decision, arguing that \u201cthe telecom industry has changed dramatically since the 1930s, and it\u2019s beyond time for regulations to catch up with that reality.\u201d But others have criticized the FCC for effectively deregulating the long-distance phone market. Critics argue that without the rule, larger companies will be able to charge smaller ones higher rates, which could carve some smaller players out of the market altogether.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision is part of a broader effort to reduce regulation and red tape in the telecommunications industry. Last year, the agency repealed net neutrality rules that would have required internet service providers to treat all online traffic equally. Supporters of that decision argued that it allowed ISPs to be more innovative and responsive to consumer needs, while critics argued that it would lead to bigger companies dominating the market and stifling competition.\nThe FCC has also been working to streamline the approval process for telecom companies, making it easier for them to build new infrastructure and deploy new services. Last year, the agency created a \u201cone-touch make-ready\u201d policy, which allows new telecom companies to more easily attach their equipment to existing poles and other infrastructure.\nThe telecom industry has been changing rapidly over the past decade, with new technologies and services emerging at a rapid pace. As a result, policymakers and regulators have been struggling to keep up with developments in the field. The FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the long-distance phone rate rule is just one example of how the agency is attempting to modernize regulations and adapt to the new realities of the market.", "Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, is considering a small cut in cocoa freight rates for the 1996/97 shipping season. This move is set to cushion local exporters from rising costs, and to make the country's cocoa more competitive on the international market.\nIvory Coast's cocoa freight rates, which are set by the government, are among the highest in the world, costing shippers up to $80 per tonne. This has led to complaints from local exporters who say that high rates are making it difficult to compete with other cocoa exporting countries. Keeping these rates unchanged could also mean a significant loss in revenue for the country.\nAccording to industry sources, the proposed cut would see freight rates fall to between $70 and $75 per tonne for the 1996/97 shipping season, down from the current rate of $80. It is believed that the decision to cut rates was influenced by a recent drop in global cocoa prices, which has led to concerns about the country's cocoa exports.\nThis move comes as cocoa prices have hit a five-year low. In September, cocoa futures fell to $1,946 per tonne in London, its lowest level since late 2013. This has led to a number of concerns in the cocoa-producing regions of West Africa, with many farmers struggling to make a living. Lower cocoa freight rates could help to alleviate some of these concerns by increasing the competitiveness of Ivorian cocoa on the global market.\nIvory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer, accounting for over 40% of world supply. The country's cocoa is highly sought after for its quality and flavour, making it a valuable commodity on the international market. However, the high cost of shipping has made it difficult for local exporters to compete with other countries such as Ghana, which has lower shipping costs.\nThe proposed cut in cocoa freight rates has been welcomed by local exporters, who say that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the international market. It is also seen as a way to increase revenue for the country, which relies heavily on cocoa exports for its economic growth.\n\"We welcome this decision by the government to cut cocoa freight rates,\" said a spokesperson for the Ivorian Cocoa Association. \"This will help to make our cocoa more competitive on the international market, and will benefit both local exporters and the country as a whole.\"\nHowever, there are concerns that the proposed cut may not be enough to make a significant impact on the country's cocoa exports. Some experts argue that more needs to be done to address the underlying issues affecting the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast, such as poor infrastructure and low productivity levels.\n\"There is no doubt that lower cocoa freight rates will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive,\" said Samir Nasr, a commodity analyst at Standard Chartered Bank. \"But there are other issues that need to be addressed in order to really boost the country's cocoa exports. These include improving transport infrastructure, increasing productivity levels, and ensuring that farmers are getting a fair price for their cocoa.\"\nDespite these concerns, the proposed cut in cocoa freight rates is seen as a positive step for Ivory Coast's cocoa industry. It is hoped that it will help to make Ivorian cocoa more competitive on the global market and increase revenue for the country.", "Detroit, MI - The United Automobile Workers Union (UAW) has set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against General Motors Corporation (GM) if a new contract agreement cannot be reached. The possibility of a strike has been looming for months, with negotiations between the UAW and GM heating up in the past few days.\nThe UAW, which represents 46,000 GM workers, has been in talks with the automaker for months. The current contract between the two parties expired on September 14th, but an extension was granted while negotiations continued. However, talks stalled in recent days, with major sticking points including wages, benefits, and job security.\nIn a memo sent to UAW leadership on Friday, union officials stated that they had given GM a final offer, which the company rejected. \"We have advised GM that if an agreement is not reached by Sunday night, the union will begin a strike at midnight,\" the memo read.\nA strike would be a major blow to GM, which is already facing challenges in the auto industry. The company reported disappointing sales numbers for the second quarter of 2021, with revenue down 34% compared to the same period in 2020. Additionally, GM is dealing with supply chain disruptions, which have led to production delays and temporary plant closures.\nThe UAW has not gone on strike against GM since 2007, when a two-day walkout cost the company an estimated $300 million. A longer strike this time around could have even greater economic impact, both for GM and for the broader economy.\nGM has not yet commented publicly on the UAW's deadline, but the company has been vocal about the challenges it faces. In a recent statement, GM CEO Mary Barra called for an end to supply chain disruptions and for increased investment in EV technology. \"We need to accelerate our EV plans and invest in the infrastructure to support them,\" Barra said.\nThe UAW, meanwhile, has been pushing for better wages and benefits for its members. The union has also expressed concerns about job security, with the possibility of plant closures looming over negotiations. In a recent statement, UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said that the union's priority is \"securing a strong and fair contract for our members.\"\nThe UAW's Sunday night deadline comes at a time when labor disputes are increasingly common in the United States. In recent years, teachers, truckers, and other workers have gone on strike in an effort to secure better wages and working conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified these tensions, with workers demanding hazard pay and greater protections against the virus.\nA strike by GM workers would also have political implications. President Joe Biden has positioned himself as a champion of the working class, and his administration has been pushing for greater investment in American infrastructure and manufacturing. A prolonged strike by GM workers could put pressure on the Biden administration to take a more active role in resolving labor disputes.\nThe UAW's deadline also coincides with Labor Day weekend, a holiday dedicated to celebrating the contributions of American workers. The holiday, which falls on the first Monday in September, is a reminder of the struggles and sacrifices made by workers throughout history. A strike by GM workers would be a potent symbol of the ongoing fight for workers' rights and economic justice.\nAs negotiations continue, the UAW and GM are both preparing for the possibility of a strike. The union has been holding strike authorization votes at GM plants across the country, with more than 90% of workers voting in favor of a walkout. GM, meanwhile, has been making contingency plans to ensure that its operations can continue in the event of a strike.\nUltimately, the fate of GM's workers and the broader auto industry rests in the hands of negotiators. If a deal can be reached by Sunday night, there will be no strike. If not, GM workers will take to the picket lines, adding another chapter to the ongoing struggle for workers' rights and economic justice.", "In response to the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan has established a panel of experts to tackle the issue of problem loans and to increase liquidity in the country's real estate market.\nThe panel, which includes officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and the Financial Services Agency, among others, will examine the impact of the pandemic on the real estate market and propose solutions to assist struggling businesses and borrowers.\nOne of the main challenges facing Japan's real estate market is an increase in problem loans, particularly in the commercial real estate sector. The pandemic has led to a decline in consumer spending and business activity, resulting in financial strains for many property owners.\nAccording to the Bank of Japan, the ratio of problem loans in the commercial real estate sector increased from 4.6% in December 2019 to 6.6% in June 2020. This upward trend is expected to continue as the pandemic continues to impact the economy.\nTo address this issue, the panel will consider measures to support distressed borrowers, such as loan restructuring and debt forgiveness. It will also explore ways to increase the availability of financing for businesses and individuals who are struggling to obtain credit.\nIn addition to addressing problem loans, the panel will also aim to increase liquidity in the real estate market. This will involve promoting investment in real estate and encouraging the development of new properties.\nOne potential solution that the panel may consider is the introduction of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which allow investors to gain exposure to the real estate market without requiring large amounts of capital. REITs have been successful in other countries, such as the United States, and could provide a boost to Japan's struggling real estate market.\nAnother potential solution that the panel may consider is the relaxation of regulations around foreign investment in the real estate market. Currently, foreign investors face significant restrictions when investing in Japanese real estate, which limits the amount of capital that can be injected into the market.\nBy relaxing these regulations, Japan could attract more foreign investment, which could increase liquidity and spur development in the real estate sector.\nThe establishment of the panel was welcomed by industry experts, who have been calling for government intervention to address the challenges facing Japan's real estate market.\n\"Given the current economic environment, it is essential that the government takes action to support struggling businesses and borrowers,\" said Masahiro Mochizuki, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.\n\"By increasing liquidity and promoting investment in real estate, the government can help to stabilize the market and support economic growth.\"\nThe panel is expected to submit its recommendations to the government by the end of the year. While it is too early to predict the exact measures that will be adopted, experts are hopeful that the panel's work will lead to a more stable and vibrant real estate market in Japan.\nOverall, the establishment of the panel is a positive step towards addressing the challenges facing Japan's real estate market. By taking a collaborative and proactive approach, the government can help to stabilize the market and support economic growth in the years to come.", "After months of speculation, the board of Greycoat Plc has finally announced its plans to resist a proposed break-up of the company. The decision comes after a flurry of activity from activist investors who have been pushing for the company's assets to be sold off to increase shareholder value.\nThe move, which was first hinted at in a report released by regulatory authorities last month, has been met with mixed reactions. Some analysts have hailed the proposal as a necessary step to unlock Greycoat's hidden value, while others have warned of the risks of dismantling a complex business structure.\nBut despite the controversy, Greycoat's board has remained steadfast in its opposition to the proposal. In a statement released yesterday, the company's chief executive, Tom Jackson, emphasized the board's confidence that it will be able to persuade institutional shareholders to reject the proposal at the upcoming annual meeting.\n\"Our core focus is on maximizing shareholder value, and we believe that the current configuration of the company is the most effective way to achieve that,\" Jackson said. \"We understand the concerns of some shareholders, but we are confident that they will ultimately see the wisdom of our position.\"\nThe proposal to break up Greycoat has been championed by a group of activists led by hedge fund manager Carl Icahn. Icahn, who is known for his aggressive approach to shareholder activism, has been pushing for the company's management to sell off its assets in order to realize their true market value.\nBut Greycoat's board has argued that this approach is short-sighted, and that it fails to take into account the complex interrelationships between the different business lines that the company operates. The board has also pointed to the long-term benefits of maintaining a diversified portfolio of assets, which can help to mitigate the risks of economic downturns or other unforeseen events.\n\"We have a long history of managing our assets in a way that balances risk and reward,\" Jackson said. \"We believe that this approach is the best way to create sustainable value for our shareholders over the long term.\"\nDespite the board's opposition, the proposal to break up Greycoat has gained support from a significant minority of shareholders. A group of institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, has reportedly been pressing for the company to consider the proposal in more detail.\nBut while this group may be vocal, it remains to be seen whether it will be able to sway the majority of shareholders to its side. According to analysts, the institutional investors are likely to face significant opposition from smaller shareholders, who may be more sympathetic to the board's position.\n\"If the institutional investors want to win this fight, they will need to put together a persuasive argument that can convince the retail investors to join their cause,\" said Mark Phillips, an analyst at investment bank Morgan Stanley. \"That won't be an easy task given the complexity of the issues at stake.\"\nWith the annual meeting just days away, the battle over Greycoat's future is likely to continue heating up. Supporters of the break-up proposal are expected to step up their lobbying efforts in the coming days, while the board of the company is likely to double down on its insistence that its current configuration is the best path forward.\nAs the battle rages on, shareholders and analysts will be watching closely to see who emerges victorious in this high-stakes fight over the future of Greycoat Plc.", "The Internet Society has backed away from a proposal to expand global address availability due to concerns about potential security risks. The proposal would have allowed a much larger range of IP addresses to be used, providing enough addresses to accommodate the expected growth of the internet for the next few decades.\nThe proposal was met with mixed reactions, with some praising the move as a necessary step forward for the internet, while others expressed concern that it could lead to an increase in cyber attacks and other security breaches.\nAfter carefully reviewing the concerns raised by members of the internet security community, the Internet Society has decided to withdraw the proposal. In a statement, the organization expressed its commitment to promoting a stable and secure internet, and acknowledged that the proposal had raised legitimate concerns about the potential for increased cyber attacks and other security risks.\nThe decision was welcomed by many in the cybersecurity community, who had been vocal in their opposition to the proposed expansion. Experts have warned that the increased availability of IP addresses could make it easier for hackers to launch large-scale attacks, and could also increase the risk of IP spoofing, where attackers forge the IP addresses of trusted sources in order to gain access to sensitive systems.\nThe decision is also likely to benefit businesses and consumers, who rely on the internet for everything from online shopping to banking and social media. By maintaining the current system of IP addressing, the Internet Society has ensured that businesses and consumers can continue to rely on the security and stability of the internet for years to come.\nWhile the decision to withdraw the proposal may be disappointing for some who had hoped for more expansive internet access, it is ultimately a victory for internet security and stability. With the continued growth of the internet, it is more important than ever to ensure that the systems and infrastructure that support it are secure and reliable, and the Internet Society's decision is a step in the right direction.", "With its breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and unique spiritual practices, Tibet has captured the imagination of travelers and explorers for centuries. However, behind the idyllic imagery lies a complex reality of life in the region, where tradition, development, and political tension coexist in an intricate web of contradictions.\nLocated on the roof of the world, at an average altitude of more than 4,500 meters (14,800 feet), Tibet is home to over 3 million people, most of whom are ethnic Tibetans. The region has a long and tumultuous history, marked by periods of independence, colonization, and conflict with neighboring powers.\nIn 1950, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) invaded Tibet and implemented a policy of integration that aimed to modernize and develop the region while eradicating its distinct cultural identity and political autonomy. The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism and the highest-ranking authority in Tibet, fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising against the Chinese rule and has been living in exile since then.\nToday, Tibet is officially recognized as an autonomous region of China and is governed by the CCP, which claims that its policies have brought economic growth, social progress, and national unity to the region. However, many Tibetans and human rights organizations argue that China's policies in Tibet have caused severe violations of fundamental rights such as freedom of religion, expression, and assembly, as well as cultural suppression and environmental degradation.\nThe reality of life in Tibet is thus a complex and dynamic mix of tradition, development, and political tension, which varies across different regions, communities, and sectors. Here are some key aspects that highlight the complexity of the Tibetan reality:\nCulture and Religion\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of Tibetan life is its rich and resilient cultural heritage, rooted in Buddhism, nomadism, and pastoralism. Tibetan culture is characterized by its artistic treasures, such as sacred thangka paintings, intricate mandalas, and unique musical traditions, as well as its social customs, such as yak racing, butter tea, and colorful festivals such as Losar or Tibetan New Year.\nAt the heart of Tibetan culture lies its spiritual tradition, which is embodied in Tibetan Buddhism, a unique blend of Mahayana and Vajrayana teachings. Tibetan Buddhism emphasizes the importance of compassion, wisdom, and meditation, and has produced eminent masters such as the Dalai Lama, Panchen Lama, and Sakya Trizin.\nHowever, in recent decades, China's policies in Tibet have led to a widespread denigration and suppression of Tibetan culture and religion, under the guise of modernization and secularism. Chinese authorities have demolished and renovated many monasteries, restricting access to religious texts and objects, and forcing monks and nuns to undergo political re-education and denounce their religious beliefs. The Chinese government has also implemented a system of patriotic education and propaganda, aimed at indoctrinating Tibetan youth with communist ideology and loyalty to the CCP.\nEconomy and Development\nAnother aspect of the Tibetan reality is its economy and development, which have undergone significant changes in the past decades, mostly driven by China's state-led investment and infrastructure projects. Tibet's economy is based on agriculture, animal husbandry, and tourism, with a significant proportion of the population living in rural areas and pastoral communities.\nSince the 1990s, China has invested heavily in Tibet's infrastructure, building roads, railways, airports, and dams to connect the region with other parts of China and facilitate the flow of goods and people. This has led to an increase in tourism, which has become one of the main sources of income for many Tibetans, as well as the emergence of new industries such as mining, hydropower, and manufacturing.\nHowever, the benefits of development have been unevenly distributed, with many Tibetans experiencing marginalization, inequality, and environmental degradation. Chinese companies and officials have exploited Tibet's natural resources, such as water, minerals, and timber, often at the expense of Tibetan livelihoods and ecological balance. The influx of Han Chinese migrants into Tibet has also created tensions and conflicts with the local population, who perceive the newcomers as a threat to their culture and identity.\nPolitics and Governance\nThe third aspect of the Tibetan reality is its politics and governance, which are intertwined with the complex history of Tibetan-Chinese relations and the ongoing struggle for autonomy and human rights. The CCP's rule in Tibet has been marked by repression, censorship, and surveillance, aimed at maintaining control over the population and suppressing dissent.\nOne of the key issues in Tibetan politics is the question of the Dalai Lama's succession, as the 85-year-old spiritual leader is seen as a symbol of Tibet's independence and sovereignty by many Tibetans and supports of the Tibetan cause. The Chinese government has enforced a policy of succession that aims to select a new Dalai Lama under its control, while the Dalai Lama himself has stated that he may not be reincarnated and that any effort to select his successor would be politically motivated and illegitimate.\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has also implemented a strategy of \"ethnic unity\" in Tibet, aimed at promoting harmony and integration among different ethnic groups, while suppressing any expression of Tibetan nationalism or separatism. This has led to a crackdown on protests, activism, and any form of dissent, resulting in the imprisonment and torture of many Tibetans who are advocating for their rights.\nConclusion\nThe reality of life in Tibet is a complex and multifaceted one, shaped by a combination of tradition, development, and political tension. Despite China's claims of progress and unity, many Tibetans and human rights advocates argue that the situation in Tibet is deteriorating, and that the Chinese policies are causing serious harm to the Tibetan people, their culture, and their environment.\nAs the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent, it is imperative that we pay attention to the issues and challenges faced by the Tibetan people, and support their aspirations for autonomy, freedom, and dignity. Only by recognizing the complexity of the Tibetan reality can we create a more just and peaceful world, where all cultures and communities are respected and valued.", "A government panel in Japan has urged the full deregulation of markets in order to avoid falling behind globally as other countries make strides in various industries. The report published earlier this month contains recommendations for a range of deregulations, including those related to agriculture, construction, and healthcare.\nThe report, titled \"Japan's Growth Strategy: Beyond COVID-19\", is the result of a review by the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy, which advises the Prime Minister's office on economic matters. The panel was chaired by Kazuo Momma, former executive director of the International Monetary Fund.\nIn his introduction to the report, Momma writes that Japan \"needs to take bold measures to create new growth engines that will ensure a prosperous and sustainable future.\" He argues that full deregulation is necessary in order to allow new industries to flourish and create new jobs.\nThe report identifies several areas where deregulation could have a significant impact on Japan's economy. One of the areas highlighted is agriculture. Currently, Japan heavily regulates its agricultural industry, including the prices of rice and other crops. The report argues that these regulations are outdated and prevent the industry from reaching its potential.\nThe panel recommends that the government abolish all agricultural regulations, including those related to the production and sale of rice. This move would allow new players to enter the market and encourage innovation and competition.\nAnother area where the panel recommends deregulation is construction. Currently, Japan's construction industry is heavily regulated, including the approval process for new buildings. The report argues that these regulations stifle innovation and increase costs.\nThe panel recommends that the government streamline the construction approval process and abolish all regulations related to building codes. This would encourage new players to enter the market and allow for the development of new technologies and construction materials.\nThe healthcare industry is also identified as an area where deregulation could lead to significant growth. Currently, healthcare regulations in Japan restrict the use of telemedicine and limit the roles of non-physician providers, such as nurse practitioners.\nThe panel recommends that the government lift all restrictions on telemedicine and expand the roles of non-physician providers. This would improve access to healthcare in rural areas and allow the industry to adopt new technologies and practices.\nThe report concludes by stating that full deregulation is necessary if Japan is to remain competitive in the global marketplace. The panel argues that by adopting a \"growth-oriented approach\", Japan can create new growth engines and build a more sustainable economy.\nReaction to the report has been mixed. Some analysts argue that full deregulation could lead to social and economic inequality, while others applaud the panel for taking a bold stance on the issue.\nCritics of the report argue that the panel has not taken into account the potential negative consequences of full deregulation. For example, deregulation of the healthcare industry could lead to increased costs for patients and a decrease in the quality of care.\nRegardless of the criticisms, the report is likely to generate debate and discussion in Japan's political circles. As the country looks to recover from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, deregulation is likely to be a key issue in the coming years.", "In a shocking turn of events, Fidelity Investments' star manager is under investigation for trades in a Vancouver-based firm.

However, tourism revenue offers a glimmer of hope for the small, central European nation.\nThe trade deficit is largely attributed to higher-than-expected imports of machinery and transport equipment. In contrast, exports of machinery and transport equipment decreased by 5.5% compared to the previous year. Additionally, exports of cars, the country's main export, fell 4.9% in 2018.\nEconomists warn that the trade deficit could have a negative impact on the Czech economy. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to 2.9% in 2018, its weakest since 2013. A persistent trade deficit could lead to a reduction in foreign investment and lower GDP growth.\nHowever, the Czech Republic's tourism industry provides a ray of hope. In 2018, the country saw a record 10.6 million tourists, an increase of 3.5% compared to the previous year. The sector generates significant revenue, accounting for 4.5% of the country's GDP.\nTourism Minister, Lubom\u00edr Zaor\u00e1lek, hailed the figures as proof that the Czech Republic was a \"popular and attractive destination\". The government has been investing heavily in tourism infrastructure, including the renovation of historical sites and increased marketing efforts.\nThe majority of visitors to the Czech Republic come from neighboring countries, including Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. However, the country has seen a surge in tourists from East Asia, particularly China and South Korea. In response, the government has launched initiatives to encourage Chinese visitors, including the introduction of a direct flight between Prague and Shanghai and the expansion of visa services.\nThe increase in tourism has also led to a boom in the hospitality industry. Hotel construction in Prague, the country's capital, reached record levels in 2018, with over 3,000 new hotel rooms added. The majority of these were budget hotels, reflecting the growing trend of budget tourism.\nThe Czech Republic's reputation as a budget-friendly destination has been boosted by the strong Czech koruna. The currency has appreciated against the euro, reducing the costs of imports and increasing the purchasing power of tourists.\nHowever, the growth in tourism has also raised concerns about overtourism. Popular sites such as Prague Castle and Charles Bridge have seen huge crowds, causing congestion and reducing the quality of the visitor experience. Local residents have also voiced concerns about the impact of tourism on their neighborhoods, including higher rents and noise pollution.\nTo address these issues, the government has proposed measures such as limiting the number of tour buses in the city center and implementing a tourist tax. However, there are concerns that such measures could discourage visitors and harm the industry.\nDespite the challenges, the Czech Republic's tourism industry remains a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy economic landscape. Economists warn that reducing the country's trade deficit will require a sustained effort to boost exports and attract foreign investment. However, the government's investment in tourism infrastructure and marketing efforts suggests that it sees the industry as a key pillar of the economy. With careful management, the sector could provide significant growth and job opportunities in the years to come.", "Conrad Plc is expected to confirm its takeover of Sheffield United Football Club in the coming weeks. It is believed that the deal will be finalised within three to four weeks, giving Conrad Plc ownership of the football club. The move comes after months of speculation surrounding the future of Sheffield United, with fans eagerly anticipating news of new ownership. The takeover is expected to bring significant investment and resources to the club, boosting its chances of success on the field. It is also likely to generate new interest and support amongst fans, who will be watching closely for details of the deal.", "The Czech Prime Minister has formed a state commission to tackle the country's bureaucracy, which has long been a source of frustration for citizens and businesses alike. The move comes as the nation commemorates the 100th anniversary of the death of celebrated author Franz Kafka, whose works often depicted the frustrations and absurdities of bureaucracy.\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the new commission would be tasked with identifying unnecessary regulations and red tape, streamlining government procedures, and finding ways to make the system more efficient and user-friendly.\n\"Our bureaucracy has long been a problem for Czech citizens and businesses,\" Babis said. \"It's time for us to take a hard look at the system and make the changes necessary to make it work better for everyone.\"\nThe commission will be chaired by Minister of Industry and Trade Karel Havlicek, and will include representatives from government agencies, businesses, and civil society organizations. It is expected to submit its recommendations to the government by the end of the year.\nThe move has been welcomed by Czech citizens and businesses, many of whom have long complained about the burden of bureaucracy in the country. A recent survey found that more than half of Czechs believe the bureaucracy is a major obstacle to doing business in the country.\n\"The bureaucracy here is just ridiculous,\" said Jan Novak, a small business owner in Prague. \"You need a mountain of paperwork just to get a permit to open a shop or a restaurant. It's a nightmare.\"\nThe commission's work is also seen as a fitting tribute to Kafka, who died in 1924 at the age of 40. Many of his most famous works, including \"The Trial\" and \"The Castle,\" are set in nightmarish bureaucratic worlds where characters struggle to make sense of the rules and regulations that govern their lives.\n\"I think Kafka would approve of this move,\" said Jana Pokorna, a Czech literature professor. \"He knew better than anyone the absurdity of bureaucracy, and how it can drive people to despair. If this commission can make even a small dent in the bureaucracy in this country, it will be a great achievement.\"", "According to a recent survey, internet usage continues to grow steadily around the world, but online services are struggling to add new customers. The study, conducted by market research firm GlobalData, found that internet usage grew by 7 percent in 2020, driven by an increase in remote work and online education during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, despite this increase in internet usage, online services such as social media platforms, streaming services, and e-commerce websites are struggling to attract new customers and maintain user engagement. The survey found that these services are facing challenges such as increased competition, data privacy concerns, and changing consumer preferences.\nSocial media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have seen a decline in user engagement, with many users opting to spend less time on these platforms or switch to newer platforms like TikTok or Instagram. Streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are facing increased competition from newer services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, which offer exclusive content and lower subscription fees.\nE-commerce websites like Amazon, which saw a surge in sales during the pandemic, are also finding it difficult to retain customers as consumers become more conscious of data privacy and security concerns. Many consumers are also opting for local e-commerce platforms that offer personalized services and faster delivery times.\nThe survey also found that online services are struggling to keep up with changing consumer preferences and behavior. With many consumers becoming more eco-conscious, there is a growing interest in sustainable e-commerce and fashion platforms. There is also a shift towards live-streaming services and more personalized experiences, particularly among younger consumers.\nDespite these challenges, online services are still growing, albeit at a slower pace. The survey found that businesses are investing in new technologies and strategies to attract and retain customers, including artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and social commerce. Companies are also focusing on improving customer experience and offering more personalized and relevant content.\nIn conclusion, while internet usage continues to grow, online services are facing significant challenges in attracting and retaining customers. As consumers become more cautious about data privacy and security, and their preferences and behavior change, online businesses will need to adapt and innovate to stay relevant in the digital world.", "Colombian Anti-Drug Prosecutor Dismisses Move to Lift Ban on Extradition as Virtually Meaningless\nThe Colombian government's recent move to lift the ban on extradition of its citizens accused of drug trafficking to the United States has been dismissed by the country's anti-drug prosecutor as virtually meaningless.\nThe ban on extradition of its citizens had been in place since 2012 when the government passed a law prohibiting the extradition of Colombian nationals accused of crimes committed in the country to any other jurisdiction, including the United States. The move was seen as an attempt to protect Colombian drug traffickers from extradition to the US, which is among the major countries that demand the extradition of Colombian nationals.\nHowever, the Colombian government announced last month that it had decided to lift the ban on extradition of its citizens related to drug trafficking to the US. The move comes in the wake of growing pressure from the US government to extradite Colombian drug lords.\nWhile the Colombian government hailed the move as a major step in the fight against drug trafficking, the country's anti-drug prosecutor, Claudia Carrasquilla, rejected it as virtually meaningless. She said the move would not change the situation on the ground, as the ban had already been lifted in practice. She pointed out that Colombia has been extraditing its citizens accused of drug trafficking to the United States even when the ban was in place.\nCarrasquilla said that since the ban was enacted in 2012, Colombia has extradited about 1,200 individuals to the US, including several notorious drug lords, such as Juan Carlos Ram\u00edrez Abad\u00eda, alias \"Chupeta,\" and Diego Montoya S\u00e1nchez, alias \"Don Diego.\" She added that the Colombian government had approved all these extraditions despite the ban.\nTherefore, Carrasquilla argued that the recent decision to lift the ban was merely a \"symbolic gesture\" aimed at pleasing the US government, which has been pushing for more extraditions. She warned that the move would not help Colombia tackle drug trafficking, which remains a major problem in the country.\nColombia is one of the world's largest producers of cocaine, and drug trafficking has long been a serious problem in the country. Despite the government's efforts to combat the trade, drug lords continue to operate across the country, using violence and corruption to maintain their illegal operations.\nThe US government has been a key ally of Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking, providing financial and military support to the country's security forces. However, the US has also been critical of Colombia's handling of drug lords, accusing the country of being too lenient on them.\nThe recent move to lift the ban on extradition of its citizens related to drug trafficking to the US is seen as an attempt by the Colombian government to appease the US administration, which has demanded that the country hand over several high-profile drug lords, including Dairo Antonio \u00dasuga, who heads Colombia's most powerful drug cartel.\nHowever, the anti-drug prosecutor's dismissal of the move as virtually meaningless suggests that it may not have the desired impact. While the Colombian government may have lifted the ban, it remains to be seen if it will actually start extraditing its citizens accused of drug trafficking to the US in significant numbers. If it does not, the move will be little more than a symbolic gesture.", "The world of financial news is set to see a new entrant, as M.A.I.D, the financial data and analytics provider, is set to launch a screen-based real-time news service to rival the likes of Reuters and Bloomberg.\nThe new service, scheduled to go live in the second quarter of this year, will offer a vast array of news, market analysis and data across a range of asset classes including equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities.\nM.A.I.D's real-time news service will be available to all subscribers of the company's flagship data terminals as well as on the company's web-based platform.

The announcement is believed to be connected to the ongoing corruption scandal involving one of his predecessors and political mentor, Guo Jinlong.\nGuo, who served as Beijing's mayor from 2008 to 2012, was recently suspected of taking bribes and other corruption charges. The Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, launched an investigation into Guo's activities. The scandal is part of President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign, which has targeted high-ranking officials and influential figures across the country.\nMayor Chen, who has been in the position since 2016, is seen as a protege of Guo. Chen was previously the president of Tsinghua University, where he worked closely with Guo, who was the university's Communist Party chief. Chen was appointed as mayor by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress after Guo's tenure ended.\nChen's resignation came as no surprise to many political analysts. It was widely expected that he would not be able to keep his position as part of the reshuffling of key officials following Guo's downfall. Chen's resignation was submitted to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which will hold a special session to review and approve it.\nThe committee will then nominate a new candidate for the position of mayor, who will be appointed by the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body. The reshuffle is expected to involve other key positions in the Beijing government.\nChen's resignation was met with mixed reactions from the public. Some praised his work during his tenure, which included improvements in the city's environment, transportation, and social welfare. Others criticized him for failing to tackle some of the city's most pressing issues, such as the high cost of living, traffic congestion, and pollution.\nChen, in his resignation letter, thanked the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, the municipal government, and the people of Beijing for their support during his time in office. He said he was grateful for the opportunity to serve the city and its residents.\n\"I have devoted all my efforts to this great city and have been privileged to work with so many dedicated and talented people,\" Chen said in his letter. \"I believe that, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Beijing will continue to prosper and flourish.\"\nAlthough Chen's resignation has been seen as part of the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, some observers have noted that it may also be linked to the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, which is scheduled to take place in 2022.\n\"The Beijing Winter Olympics is an important event for the city and the country,\" said Lu Qi, a Beijing-based political scientist. \"The leadership wants to ensure that everything runs smoothly and without any hiccups. They want to make sure that the officials in charge are competent and trustworthy.\"\nThe Beijing government has been under pressure to ensure that the Winter Olympics is a success, as it is a major opportunity for Beijing to showcase its economic and political power to the world. Chen's resignation may be part of a broader effort to guarantee that the event is well-managed and scandal-free.\nIn the end, whether Chen's resignation is part of a reshuffle triggered by Guo's corruption scandal or a move to ensure the success of the Winter Olympics, it shows that the Chinese government takes swift action against officials accused of wrongdoing. It is a clear sign that President Xi's anti-corruption campaign will continue to be a major priority for the Chinese leadership.", "In a major blow to one of the world's largest agribusiness companies, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has lost several key executives in the wake of pleading guilty to price fixing. The scandal has sent shockwaves through the industry and sparked new concerns over antitrust violations.\nADM, which produces everything from corn and soybeans to ethanol and animal feed, acknowledged last week that it had participated in a conspiracy to fix the prices of lysine and other animal feed additives. The company agreed to pay a $60 million fine to the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a plea deal.\nThe fallout from the scandal has been swift and wide-ranging, particularly for ADM's senior leadership. Three top executives have stepped down from the company, including CEO Juan Luciano, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young, and Chief Operating Officer Fritz Corrigan. The departures have raised questions about the company's future direction and management stability.\nLuciano, who had led ADM since 2015, was widely praised for his efforts to modernize the company and expand its global footprint. Under his tenure, ADM completed several major acquisitions, including a $3 billion deal for European grain trader Bunge in 2018. However, the price-fixing scandal has tarnished his legacy and made him a controversial figure within the company.\nYoung, who was widely respected for his financial acumen, had been with ADM for more than a decade. His departure is seen as a significant loss for the company, which must now find a new CFO to fill his shoes. Corrigan, who had served as COO since 2014, was less well-known but still considered a key member of ADM's executive team.\nThe departures of Luciano, Young, and Corrigan have left a leadership vacuum at ADM just as it is facing a growing list of challenges. In addition to the price-fixing scandal, the company faces rising competition from other agribusiness giants like Cargill and Bunge, as well as pressures from consumer groups and regulators to adopt more sustainable and ethical practices. ADM's board of directors will need to act quickly to try to restore investor confidence and reassure its tens of thousands of employees around the world.\nThe fallout from the ADM scandal has also prompted new concerns about antitrust violations in the agribusiness industry. Critics argue that the industry is too concentrated in the hands of a few large companies, which can collaborate to drive up prices for farmers and other customers. The ADM case is just the latest example of these concerns, which have led to calls for greater regulation and oversight.\nIn response to the scandal, several U.S. lawmakers have called for tighter antitrust enforcement and new laws to prevent price fixing and other anti-competitive practices. Some have even suggested breaking up the largest agribusiness companies to increase competition and accountability. Meanwhile, consumer groups and activists are stepping up their campaigns to promote fair trade and sustainable agriculture practices.\nThe ADM scandal also highlights the challenges facing companies operating in today's highly interconnected and complex global markets. With so many players vying for market share and profits, businesses must navigate a growing web of regulatory requirements, ethical standards, and public expectations. Failing to do so can have major consequences for their reputation, finances, and employees.\nThe ADM case is a cautionary tale for other companies that may be tempted to engage in anti-competitive practices for short-term gain. While such practices may boost profits and market share in the short term, they can ultimately undermine the long-term viability and legitimacy of a business. Companies that fail to uphold ethical and legal standards will find themselves facing intense scrutiny from regulators, customers, and investors.\nIn conclusion, the ADM scandal represents a major setback for the agribusiness industry and has raised new questions about antitrust violations. The loss of several key executives has left the company in a fragile state and forced it to grapple with a range of challenges. However, the scandal may also serve as a wake-up call for the industry and encourage greater accountability and transparency in the future. As companies face mounting pressures to act responsibly and sustainably, they must work to build trust with their stakeholders and uphold ethical and legal standards.", "Guardian Royal Exchange (GRE), one of the UK's leading insurance companies, has announced that it will be cutting 350 jobs as part of a restructuring move that aims to streamline the company's operations and improve profitability.\nThe job cuts will affect mostly back-office and administrative positions, as well as some underwriting and claims roles. The company said that it will try to minimize the impact on employees by offering voluntary redundancies, early retirements, and other measures.\nGRE said that the restructuring was necessary to address the challenges facing the insurance industry, including increased competition, rising costs, and changing customer demands. The company also cited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and the insurance market.\n\"We have reviewed our business operations and identified areas where we can become more efficient and effective in serving our customers and driving growth,\" said Mark Wilson, GRE's CEO. \"This means making some tough decisions, including reducing our workforce, but we believe it is the right thing to do for the long-term success of our company and our customers.\"\nGRE said that the restructuring would also involve simplifying its product range, investing in technology and digital capabilities, and improving its customer service and claims handling processes. The company said that it remained committed to its core markets and would continue to offer a wide range of insurance products, including property, casualty, and specialty lines.\nThe news of the job cuts was met with disappointment and concern from the affected employees and their union representatives. Unite, the largest trade union in the UK's finance sector, said that it would be seeking assurances from the company on job security, fair treatment of staff, and consultation procedures.\n\"Cutting jobs in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis is a reckless move that will do more harm than good,\" said Roy Rickhuss, Unite's national officer for finance. \"We will be pressing GRE to explore all alternatives to redundancies and to work with us to minimize the impact on our members and their families.\"\nThe job cuts at GRE come amid a challenging period for the UK's insurance industry, which has been hit by a wave of claims stemming from the pandemic, as well as ongoing regulatory pressures and Brexit uncertainty. Many insurers have had to increase their premiums or tighten their underwriting standards in response to these trends.\nDespite the headwinds, GRE said that it remained optimistic about its future prospects. The company pointed to its strong brand and reputation, its diverse and resilient business model, and its experienced and talented workforce as key assets that would help it succeed in the years ahead.\n\"We are confident that this restructuring will put us on a sound footing to compete and thrive in a rapidly changing and dynamic industry,\" said Wilson. \"We are committed to supporting our customers, our employees, and our shareholders as we navigate these challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.\"", "As the world's largest socialist economy, China has been making a significant effort to modernize its economy and to develop a strong private sector while still relying heavily on its state enterprises. However, one of the major challenges facing China's economy is the unemployment of workers from state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This is a result of China's ongoing economic transformation, which has been marked by a shift from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy. As the country adapts to these changes, a wave of layoffs has swept through the state sector, raising fears of rising unemployment rates. \nDespite these concerns, China's private sector has been providing new job opportunities for the large numbers of workers who are being laid off from state-owned enterprises. According to official figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics, private enterprises created an impressive 13.73 million new jobs in the first nine months of 2021. This constitutes a 50.7% increase over the same period last year when only 9.05 million new jobs were created in the private sector. \nMeanwhile, the employment situation in the state sector has been less rosy. According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, in the first half of 2021, there were 5.92 million layoffs, including 1.97 million involuntary redundancies. This figure represents a 8.4% increase compared to the same period last year and the trend is expected to continue. \nOne reason for the shift towards private employment is the economic growth and the increasing demand for services. As consumers in China are becoming wealthier, the service sector has been expanding rapidly, providing new employment opportunities in areas such as retail, hospitality and healthcare. In fact, the service sector has been the largest contributor to new job creation in the private sector with 41% of the new jobs created in 2021 coming from this sector. \nAnother factor contributing to the success of the private sector in absorbing laid-off workers is the government's supportive policies. In response to concerns about job losses, the Chinese government has been proactive in encouraging private sector growth and supporting laid-off workers. In 2021 the government has implemented a range of measures, including tax cuts, a reduction in social security fees, and government subsidies for the training of workers. Additionally, the government has created special funds to support small- and medium-sized enterprises, which are often the most likely employers of laid-off workers. \nWhile the private sector has been expanding rapidly, it is important to note that job creation is not evenly distributed across all regions in China. The coastal provinces have been the most successful in creating new jobs, with regions such as Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu the most active in private sector job creation. However, the situation is more difficult for workers in less developed inland regions where the private sector is less developed and government policy support is limited. \nDespite the challenges, China has made significant progress in addressing the issue of unemployment. The private sector has played an important role in this process, creating new jobs and providing opportunities for laid-off workers from SOEs. In addition, government policies and support are helping facilitate this process of transition. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to ensure that all regions in China have the necessary resources and conditions for private sector growth and job creation. \nIn summary, China's private sector has been providing new job opportunities for workers who are being laid off from state-owned enterprises, despite fears of rising unemployment. The private sector has been expanding rapidly, particularly in the service sector, and the government has implemented supportive measures to encourage private sector growth and support laid-off workers. While more work needs to be done to ensure that private sector job creation is more evenly distributed across China's regions, the progress that has been made thus far is promising.", "A former German secret agent and his wife have been charged with abduction in a failed kidnap rescue mission in Colombia. The duo allegedly tried to rescue a businessman who had been abducted by a criminal gang in the South American country.\nThe former agent, who has not been named, reportedly flew to Colombia with his wife after hearing about the businessman's abduction. He had previously worked for the German security services and had experience in overseas operations.\nAccording to reports, the couple hired local informants to gather intelligence on the gang's whereabouts before embarking on a mission to rescue the businessman. They allegedly arrived at the gang's hideout in the city of Cali, armed with guns and handcuffs.\nHowever, the mission quickly went awry when the agent and his wife were discovered by the gang members. Shots were fired, and the couple was forced to flee the scene. The businessman was not rescued, and the gang members reportedly increased their demands for his release following the botched operation.\nThe former agent and his wife were eventually arrested by the Colombian authorities and charged with abduction, possession of firearms, and attempted coercion. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison.\nThe German government has confirmed that the former agent worked for its security services in the past but stated that he was not acting on behalf of the government in this instance. The government also stated that it does not support vigilante justice or extrajudicial actions.\nThe case has raised concerns about the use of private citizens in overseas rescue operations and the potential risks involved. The German authorities have urged citizens not to take matters into their own hands and to cooperate with the relevant authorities when faced with similar situations.\nThe businessman who was abducted has since been rescued by the Colombian authorities. He reportedly suffered minor injuries during his captivity but is said to be recovering well.\nThe case has attracted significant media attention in Germany and beyond, with many questioning the motives of the former agent and his wife. The duo has yet to make a public statement on the matter. The trial is expected to begin in the coming months.", "Hong Kong-based financial services firm Jardine Fleming Holdings has reiterated its commitment to regulatory compliance following an investigation by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) into allegations of front-running.\nIn a statement released yesterday, the firm said it had cooperated fully with the SFC's investigation and was pleased to have been cleared of any wrongdoing. However, it added that it would \"continue to prioritize compliance and risk management in all aspects of our business.\"\nFront-running is the practice of a broker trading in a security based on advanced knowledge of an impending transaction by a client. It is illegal in many jurisdictions, including Hong Kong.\nThe allegations against Jardine Fleming centered around a trade in Hong Kong-listed shares in August 2020. The SFC received information suggesting that Jardine Fleming had traded in the shares ahead of a large buy order from a client, potentially profiting from the price increase that would result from the order.\nThe SFC launched an investigation into the matter, which included a review of Jardine Fleming's policies and procedures around Chinese wall (the separation of different departments within a bank to prevent conflicts of interest). The regulator also interviewed staff members and reviewed trading records.\nIn its statement, Jardine Fleming emphasized that it had clear and robust policies and procedures in place to prevent front-running and other types of market abuse. The firm said it was \"committed to maintaining a culture of compliance and ethical behavior\" and would continue to invest in training and technology to support this.\nJardine Fleming's CEO, Michael Li, stressed that the firm's reputation for integrity and transparency was of paramount importance. \"We take any allegation of impropriety very seriously and will always cooperate fully with regulators to ensure that the highest standards are maintained in our business,\" he said.\nThe SFC's investigation is part of a wider crackdown on market abuse in Hong Kong. The regulator has been taking a more aggressive approach to enforcement in recent years, with a particular focus on insider dealing and market manipulation.\nLast year, the SFC fined Goldman Sachs HKD 350 million ($45 million) for its role in the 1MDB scandal, where the US bank's employees allegedly paid bribes to Malaysian officials in exchange for lucrative deals for the bank.\nHong Kong's financial market is heavily regulated, but there have been concerns in recent years about the effectiveness of the regulatory framework. The city's reputation as a financial hub has also been tarnished by political unrest and concerns about Beijing's influence.\nJardine Fleming's reiteration of its commitment to regulatory compliance is therefore timely, and may help to shore up confidence in Hong Kong's financial sector. The firm's statement suggests that it takes its responsibilities as a financial institution seriously, and is willing to invest in compliance measures to ensure that it meets the highest standards.", "Microsoft Corp's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Amy Hood has recently shared a positive outlook for the company's revenue growth over the next two quarters. Speaking at a company conference, Hood revealed that the company is expecting revenue growth of 19% for the first quarter of 2022 and 16% for the second quarter.\nHood attributed the growth to the ongoing demand for the company's cloud and gaming products, among others.

The segment reported a 32% increase in revenues year-over-year, amassing $374 million in the first quarter.\nWhile maintaining its profit target, News Corp. has decided to be more cautious when it comes to financing new acquisitions, given the first-quarter results. This comes as the media company had been making significant investments in recent years, including the $219 million acquisition of the consumer research firm Numerator.\nThe company\u2019s chief financial officer, Susan Panuccio, acknowledged that there has been more scrutiny on the company\u2019s acquisitions, as investors look for demonstrable returns on investment.\n\u201cWe have had a lot of scrutiny about acquisitions\u2026 We will be more conservative in how we finance some of those acquisitions,\u201d Panuccio said.\nGoing forward, News Corp. plans to prioritize investments in its digital and real estate platforms, as it looks to strengthen its position in those areas.

The surge in the market comes amid growing optimism about the economic recovery, boosted by the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and the gradual reopening of businesses across the country.\nThe TSX reached an intraday high of 19,634.17 points, up 0.31 percent, before closing at 19,610.11 points. The rally was driven by strong gains in the energy and financial sectors, which rose 1.68 percent and 1.04 percent, respectively.\nInvestors were buoyed by positive economic data, including a report showing Canada's manufacturing sector expanded in February at the fastest pace in two and a half years. The report, released on Monday by IHS Markit, showed the purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the sector rose to 58.5, up from 55.6 in January.\nThe PMI is a measure of manufacturing activity and is based on a survey of purchasing managers in the sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below 50 indicates contraction. The PMI for the services sector also rose in February, to 56.1 from 54.4 in January.\nAnother factor driving the market was the Bank of Canada's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 0.25 percent, where it has been since March 2020. The central bank also reiterated its commitment to keeping the rate low until economic slack is absorbed and inflation returns to its 2 percent target.\n\"We remain committed to leaving the overnight rate at the effective lower bound until slack is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved,\" said Governor Tiff Macklem in a statement.\nDespite the market's gains, some investors remain cautious about the potential for a market correction.

The ban was initially scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2021, but has now been postponed to a later date.\nChina's General Administration of Customs had announced the ban earlier this month, citing concerns over the presence of COVID-19 in shipments of frozen foods. The ban would have affected all poultry products from the United States, including those that had already been shipped but were yet to clear Chinese customs.\nThe postponement of the ban comes after a meeting between officials from the two countries, which was held to discuss China's concerns about food imports. China has been grappling with sporadic outbreaks of COVID-19 in recent months, with the virus being traced back to frozen foods in some cases.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) welcomed the postponement of the ban, saying it would provide an opportunity for discussions on the safety of U.S. poultry products. \"The USDA is committed to ensuring the safety of U.S. food and agricultural products, and we are pleased that China has agreed to postpone its import ban on U.S. poultry,\" the department said in a statement.\nThe postponement of the ban is also expected to provide a financial reprieve to American poultry farmers, who had already shipped millions of dollars' worth of poultry products to China. According to the USDA, the United States exported nearly $500 million worth of poultry products to China in 2019, making it one of the largest markets for U.S. poultry.\nThe announcement of the ban had come as a shock to American farmers, who had been hoping to boost exports to China following the signing of the Phase One trade deal earlier this year. The deal had included commitments from China to purchase $32 billion worth of agricultural products from the United States over the next two years, with poultry being a key part of that agreement.\nWhile the delay of the ban is good news for American farmers, it remains to be seen when the ban will come into effect. China has not given a new date for the ban, but has instead said that it will continue its discussions with the United States on food safety issues.\nThe postponement of the ban comes at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and China, with both sides engaged in a trade war that has seen the imposition of tariffs on a range of goods. The successful conclusion of the phase one trade deal had been seen as a welcome respite in the long-running dispute, but the move to ban U.S. poultry imports had threatened to rekindle tensions between the two sides.", "News Corp has announced a conservative financial strategy backed by a cash reserve of $2.5 billion. The media company, which is home to numerous publications including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, and HarperCollins, will use this stability to navigate the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and to pursue growth opportunities.\nThis move has been welcomed by investors and analysts, who view it as a responsible approach during these unprecedented times. According to Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp, the company is \u201cdetermined to emerge from the pandemic with a clear direction and a bold strategy for growth.\u201d\nThe cash reserve has been built up over the past few years through asset sales, cost-cutting measures, and divestments. The company has also reduced its net debt by approximately $1.26 billion since 2016, demonstrating a commitment to financial stability.\nThe new strategy will focus on \u201cdigital-first\u201d growth, according to Thomson. This includes expanding the company\u2019s online businesses and investing in new technologies to stay ahead of competitors. News Corp already has a strong digital presence, with more than 140 million monthly users across its online properties. The company plans to build on this foundation by increasing content production, launching new products, and forging partnerships with other businesses.\nThomson also emphasized the importance of investing in digital advertising technologies. With the pandemic accelerating the shift to online transactions, News Corp recognizes the potential growth opportunities in this area. The company plans to invest in advanced advertising tools to enhance the effectiveness of its digital advertising operations.\nAt the same time, the company will continue to operate its traditional businesses, such as print publications and book publishing. However, News Corp will be more selective in its investments and will prioritize areas with the greatest potential for growth. For example, the company recently acquired Investor\u2019s Business Daily, which provides investing news and analysis to retail investors.\nAnalysts have praised News Corp\u2019s strategy for its balance between stability and growth. The cash reserve provides a safety net during uncertain times, while the focus on digital growth allows the company to remain competitive in a fast-changing media landscape.\nAnother positive for investors is News Corp\u2019s relatively low valuation compared to other media companies. The stock has been trading at a discount to its peers for several years, which may indicate potential for future growth. With the new strategy, the company may be able to realize this potential and offer attractive returns to shareholders.\nDespite the positive reception, News Corp may still face challenges in executing its strategy. The media industry is notoriously unpredictable, with changing consumer behavior and technological advancements creating a volatile environment. Additionally, the pandemic has forced many media companies to restructure and downsize, which may lead to increased competition in certain areas.\nHowever, Thomson remains confident in the company\u2019s ability to navigate these challenges. \u201cThese are challenging times for media companies, but News Corp has a strong track record of adapting to change and innovating in response to new trends,\u201d he said in a statement.\nOverall, News Corp\u2019s conservative financial strategy with a significant cash reserve is a positive step for the company and its investors. By focusing on digital growth and investing in advanced advertising tools, the company may be able to overcome the challenges facing the media industry and achieve long-term success.", "The ice cream industry in Europe has taken a huge hit this year due to the unseasonably dull summer. Major players in the industry are struggling to keep their bottom lines in the black, with many of them exploring fresh marketing strategies for the winter season.\nThe summer season traditionally represents the peak of sales for ice cream companies, with footfall at ice cream parlors and retail stores increasing drastically. Unfortunately, 2020 is not like any other year, and the lack of tourists and locals out and about to enjoy ice cream for the most substantial part of the season is a severe setback for the industry.\nIce cream giants are now realizing the severity of the situation and resisting from looking at the summer as the only season to boost their sales. Consequently, there has been a shift in the focus of their product offerings towards winter flavors and, of course, seasonal sorbets.\nThe ice cream industry is fiercely competitive, and many big names in the business are proactive and always seeking out new ways to appeal to their customers. This year, they are getting innovative and looking at winter flavors as an opportunity to cater to sophisticated tastes.\nMany of these ice cream companies have turned towards creating unique flavors tied to different holidays such as Christmas and New Year. They are using eye-catching packaging materials to entice people to buy their products, in an attempt to stand out from competition and increase their market share.\nThe shift in the marketing strategies of the industry has been reflected in the retail stores too. Many shops are now displaying more winter-themed ice creams prominent on the shelves, with Christmas and Hanukkah flavors taking center stage. Advertisements are not only exclusively aimed at children, as adults are increasingly becoming the target market as well.\nIn an interview with one of the major players in the industry, the Baskin-Robbins Senior Director of Global Marketing, Carolyn O\u2019 Keefe, confirmed the company was hoping their ice cream flavors for the winter season would boost sales following the poor summer.\nO\u2019Keefe said, \u201cIn the past, we have tended to focus more on introducing ice-cream-based products during the summer. But the impact of the coronavirus means we need to be much more creative, and we have come up with some fantastic winter flavors that we hope are going to appeal to customers\u2019 tastes.\u201d\nSome of the winter flavors O\u2019Keefe mentioned include Gingerbread Cheesecake, Roasted Turkey Ice Cream, and Dijon Mustard Ice Cream, which she believes will interest more adventurous customers.\nFurthermore, the company has plans to introduce much more fruity flavors as more people prefer a healthier option. Such flavors incorporate cinnamon, chestnut, and caramel to combine the comfort and nostalgia of winter. Of course, O\u2019Keefe also acknowledged the role ice cream plays in people\u2019s mental health. Its sweetness and refreshing taste help some to cope with the gloomy weather during the winter months.\nA representative of Unilever, a conglomerate with a significant stake in the ice cream industry, confirmed that big players are taking the winter months much more seriously this year. \u201cWe have departments exclusively focused on creating new winter flavors and increasing our presence during the winter months,\u201d the representative said.\nThe representative further explains that Unilever has plans to advertise their product ranges in movies, TV-series, commercials, and radio shows. Though not exclusively aimed at adults, the company hopes that this strategy will attract their target audience.\nIn general, the ice cream industry has had a hard time due to the pandemic. Still, with the shift towards winter flavors and season-themed sorbets, there is hope that sales will pick up during the winter months to help recover some of the losses experienced during the summer.\nThe winter period is crucial not only for the ice cream industry but also the retail industry in general. Whichever way this season turns out, it is safe to say that companies\u2019 resilience and innovation can mean the difference between their survival or demise during these unprecedented times.", "Sprint Corp, the American telecommunications company, has shifted its focus away from its local telephone ventures with cable companies and is now focusing on reselling its existing services. The move comes as Sprint Corp looks to streamline its operations and cut costs, while also providing customers with better value for their money.\nThe shift in strategy, which was announced yesterday, means that Sprint Corp will no longer be pursuing its plans to launch local telephone services in partnership with cable companies. This move has come as a surprise to many in the industry, as the company had previously been heavily investing in the development of these services.\nSpeaking about the decision, a spokesperson for Sprint Corp said: \"We have decided to put our local telephone ventures with cable companies on the back burner for the time being. While we still believe that these services could eventually be a valuable addition to our offerings, we have decided that it is more important to focus on reselling our existing services at this time.\"\nThe spokesperson went on to explain that the decision was made in response to changing market conditions, as well as the need for Sprint Corp to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace. With other telecommunications companies also offering local telephone services in partnership with cable companies, Sprint Corp has found it difficult to differentiate its offering and has struggled to attract customers.\nInstead of spending time and resources developing these services, Sprint Corp will be focusing on reselling its existing services, such as mobile and internet services. This will allow the company to cut costs and simplify its operations, while also providing customers with a greater range of services and a better overall experience.\nThis change in strategy is expected to have a significant impact on the telecommunications industry, as other companies may be forced to follow Sprint Corp's lead in order to remain competitive. With the market becoming increasingly crowded, companies will need to find new ways to differentiate themselves and provide customers with value for their money.\nDespite the shift in strategy, Sprint Corp remains confident in its ability to compete in the telecommunications market. The company has a long-standing reputation for providing reliable and high-quality services, and it has a strong customer base that is loyal and supportive. With the right strategy in place, Sprint Corp believes that it can continue to thrive in the years ahead.\nAs part of its new focus on reselling existing services, Sprint Corp will be investing heavily in marketing and advertising in the coming months. The company is keen to promote its range of services and showcase the benefits that it can offer to customers. Through a combination of targeted advertising and promotions, Sprint Corp hopes to attract new customers and retain its existing customer base.\nOverall, this shift in strategy marks an important turning point for Sprint Corp. By focusing on reselling existing services, the company is simplifying its operations, cutting costs, and providing customers with a better overall experience. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other companies respond to this change and what it means for the future of the telecommunications market.", "Chile, a leading copper producer, is looking to deepen its trade and technical ties with China, the world's largest importer of the metal.

According to a statement from Chile's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two officials discussed the importance of promoting trade and investment between the two countries, particularly in the areas of copper, renewable energy, agriculture, and tourism.\n\"We have a very close relationship with China, and we believe that there is a lot of potential for further cooperation,\" Minister Allamand said in a statement. \"Chile is committed to furthering our economic ties with China, as we believe that this will not only benefit our countries, but also contribute to the overall stability and prosperity of the region.\"\nIn recent years, Chile has become increasingly dependent on China as a market for its copper exports. According to data from the Chilean Copper Commission, China accounted for nearly 50% of Chile's total copper exports in 2020, up from 44% in 2019. This growing reliance on China has raised concerns about the vulnerability of the Chilean economy to a slowdown in demand from China.\nTo address these concerns, Chile is seeking to diversify its export markets and expand its technical cooperation with China. In particular, Chile is looking to promote the development of new technologies and industries, such as renewable energy and electric vehicles, that could help reduce the country's dependence on copper exports.\nIn addition to its economic ties, Chile is also seeking to deepen its cultural and educational ties with China. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the two countries are looking to expand their exchange programs for students and researchers, as well as promote greater cultural understanding and exchange.\nOverall, Chile's efforts to strengthen its ties with China reflect a growing recognition of the importance of economic and political relations between the two countries. As the world's largest copper importer, China is a critical market for Chilean exports, and a key partner in the development of new technologies and industries. By enhancing its cooperation with China, Chile hopes to secure its economic future and deepen its ties with a crucial global player.", "China is set to allow foreign banks that have been shortlisted for local renminbi currency business in the country. This move is expected to allow foreign banks to gain access to the lucrative Chinese market and help in boosting the country's financial system.\nChina has been known for its tightly controlled banking system, limiting the number of foreign banks that could operate within the country. Foreign banks have been vying for a bigger presence in China, with more than 40 foreign financial institutions applying for licenses to underwrite sales of bonds denominated in renminbi, China's currency.\nAccording to sources, Citibank, HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of East Asia are among the shortlisted banks that China will allow to operate with international licenses in its local renminbi market. These banks were chosen because of their strong capital base and their ability to meet regulatory requirements.\nThis move comes as China aims to further its financial reform agenda, opening up its domestic financial market to foreign banks. With the country facing economic challenges such as a slowdown in GDP growth, trade tensions with the United States, and an aging population, China's government has been focused on reforming its financial system to support sustainable growth.\nForeign banks that operate in China's domestic market will be able to offer a range of financial services to their clients, including underwriting bonds, trading derivatives, and raising capital for Chinese firms. This will also allow these banks to participate in syndicated loan deals in China. Ultimately, this move is expected to lead to more competition in the domestic financial industry, which in turn will help to drive innovation and bring more benefits to consumers.\nChina has taken several steps to open its financial markets over the last few years. In 2018, the country relaxed its rules on foreign ownership of Chinese banks, allowing foreign institutions to hold up to 51% stake in a joint venture. The central bank of China also scrapped quotas on the amount that foreign investors could invest in its stocks and bonds markets.\nForeign banks that have been shortlisted for local renminbi currency business will need to obtain regulatory approval before they can operate in the country. Additionally, there are some concerns over the potential risks associated with the opening up of China's financial markets, such as risks to financial stability and foreign exchange rate risks. Nevertheless, this move towards greater openness in the financial sector is a significant development for China, and more opportunities are expected to arise as a result.", "In recent years, the food industry has been focusing its attention on millennials, specifically those who do not enjoy cooking. Dubbed \"non-cooking millennials,\" this demographic has become a key target for food companies as they look to increase their sales and profits.\nRecent studies have shown that nearly half of millennials prefer to eat out or order takeout rather than cook at home. This trend has been attributed to a variety of factors, including busy schedules, a lack of cooking skills, and a desire for convenience.\nRecognizing the potential for growth in this market, food companies have been developing new products and marketing strategies to appeal to non-cooking millennials. These efforts have included the creation of pre-packaged meal kits, the introduction of more convenient and easy-to-prepare options, and the use of social media influencers and other digital marketing tactics.\nOne of the companies leading the charge is Blue Apron, a meal kit service that delivers pre-portioned ingredients and recipes to customers' doors. Since its launch in 2012, Blue Apron has become a household name, with a reported 750,000 subscribers as of 2018. The company has also expanded its offerings to include wine pairings and even a market for customers to purchase individual ingredients.\nAnother company leveraging the trend is Grubhub, a food delivery service that has seen a surge in popularity among millennials. According to a report by Cowen and Company, Grubhub's sales increased by 36% year over year in 2018, driven in part by the company's focus on convenience and an easy-to-use app.\nIn addition to these companies, traditional food brands such as Campbell's and Kraft have also been taking steps to appeal to non-cooking millennials. Campbell's has launched a line of pre-made soup cups and even a line of \"Well Yes!\" soups marketed as a healthier option. Kraft, meanwhile, has introduced a line of \"Easy Mac\" products and a variety of pre-made pasta dishes.\nTo reach the non-cooking millennial demographic, many companies have been increasing their digital marketing efforts. This includes partnerships with social media influencers, targeted digital ads, and even the creation of branded social media accounts.\nOne example of this strategy in action is the launch of the Instagram account \"Every Plate,\" a meal kit service targeted at budget-conscious millennials. The account features brightly colored food photos, easy-to-follow recipes, and a playful tone in its captions and stories.\nWhile these efforts have proven successful for many food companies, some experts warn that the trend towards convenience and away from cooking could have negative consequences in the long run. \"Cooking skills are an important part of a healthy lifestyle,\" says nutritionist Laura Thomas. \"If we don't encourage people to cook more, we could see a rise in diet-related health problems in the future.\"\nDespite these concerns, the trend towards non-cooking millennials shows no signs of slowing down. As food companies continue to develop new products and marketing strategies, it remains to be seen what impact this trend will have on the food industry as a whole.", "During a NATO meeting held in Brussels yesterday, Italy has expressed its support for the integration of Slovakia and Romania into the alliance as full members.\nThe Italian Defence Minister, Lorenzo Guerini, said that Italy had been advocating for the enlargement of NATO for a long time, and that Slovakia and Romania would make excellent allies. Guerini also emphasized the strategic importance of expanding NATO's presence in Eastern Europe to counterbalance the growing influence of Russia in the region.\nThe Italian minister's comments were echoed by several other NATO representatives, including the US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin. Austin praised Slovakia and Romania for their contributions to NATO's operations and said that their full membership would strengthen the alliance's capabilities.\nThe integration of Slovakia and Romania into NATO has been a topic of discussion for some time, but it has not yet been finalized. Both countries have been working closely with NATO for years and have participated in many of the alliance's missions, including in Afghanistan and Kosovo.\nIn recent years, Russia's aggressive actions in Eastern Europe have prompted NATO to increase its presence in the region. Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are already NATO members, and the addition of Slovakia and Romania would further strengthen the alliance's position.\nHowever, there are still some concerns about the integration of these two countries. NATO's enlargement may provoke a negative reaction from Russia, which has already criticized the alliance's expansion in the region.\nMoreover, the integration of Slovakia and Romania could also face opposition from some NATO members who are hesitant to take on new commitments and financial obligations.\nDespite these challenges, Italy's advocacy for Slovakia and Romania's integration into the alliance appears to have gained some momentum at the Brussels meeting, suggesting that it could become a reality in the near future.", "A recent survey has revealed that parents want the television industry to spell out the sexual and violence content of shows before they air. The survey, conducted by a prominent research institute, found that 86% of parents believe that TV shows should have this information clearly marked on them.\nThe survey was conducted across the country and collected data from parents with children aged between 5 and 18. The results of the survey found that parents are becoming increasingly concerned over the amount of sexual and violent content being aired on television. The findings indicate that these issues are a major concern for parents, who believe that the industry should take responsibility for ensuring that parents are fully informed about the content of the shows.\nThe survey also found that 72% of the parents believe that there should be stronger regulations around the content of television shows, and that broadcasters should be held accountable for the material they broadcast. A further 65% of parents surveyed believe that there should be more educational programs made available for children to watch.\nThe results of the survey have been welcomed by parenting groups and child advocacy groups, who are calling for the television industry to take notice of the concerns of parents. The groups are urging TV networks to take responsibility for the types of programs and content shown on their channels.\nIn response to the survey, a spokesperson for one of the major television networks stated that the network was committed to airing programs that were suitable for all audiences, and that they would continue to work with parents and advocacy groups to address concerns around the content of shows.\nThere is no doubt that the debate surrounding television content will continue, with parents demanding greater accountability and regulations around content. This survey highlights the need for greater transparency and clarity for parents around the programs their children are watching.  It remains to be seen whether the television industry will respond to these concerns, but the survey indicates that parents are becoming increasingly vocal in their demand for changes.", "The autonomous region of Tibet has always been a point of controversy between the Chinese government and the Tibetan people. The Chinese government claims that Tibet has always been a part of China, while the Tibetan government-in-exile and many human rights organizations argue that Tibet was an independent state until it was annexed by China in 1951.\nRegardless of one's political beliefs, there is no doubt that Tibet is one of the least developed regions in China, with a poverty rate of over 12%. In an effort to close the development gap between Tibet and the rest of China, the central government has invested billions of yuan in the region over the past few decades.\nAccording to the Chinese government, since 1951, more than 100 billion yuan ($14 billion) has been invested in Tibet. The investment has been used to improve infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other areas in the region.\nOne of the most significant infrastructure projects in Tibet is the Qinghai-Tibet railway, which was completed in 2006. The railway is the highest in the world, with its highest point at 5,072 meters above sea level. The railway has contributed significantly to the development of Tibet's economy by increasing tourism and transportation.\nThe railway has also made it easier for the Chinese government to control Tibet, as it allows for the rapid deployment of troops and supplies to the region. Some activists have criticized the railway, arguing that it has made it easier for the Chinese government to suppress dissent in Tibet.\nDespite the Chinese government's investment in Tibet, the region continues to lag behind the rest of China in many areas. According to the World Bank, in 2019, Tibet had a GDP per capita of approximately $5,700, which is lower than the national average of $10,800.\nThe Chinese government has identified poverty alleviation as one of its major priorities in Tibet. In 2020, the government declared that it had eradicated absolute poverty in Tibet, meaning that no one in the region lives below the poverty line of 4,000 yuan ($622) per year.\nHowever, some Tibetans have criticized the government's poverty alleviation efforts, arguing that they are superficial and do not address the root causes of poverty in the region. Many Tibetans also argue that the Chinese government's policies have contributed to the impoverishment of the region, as they have disrupted traditional Tibetan agricultural and pastoral practices.\nIn addition to poverty alleviation, the Chinese government has also made efforts to improve education in Tibet. In recent years, the government has invested heavily in building schools and providing education to Tibetan children.\nAccording to the Chinese government, there are currently over 4,000 schools in Tibet, and the enrollment rate for primary and secondary education is over 99%. The government has also made efforts to promote bilingual education in Tibetan areas, with the goal of promoting Mandarin Chinese while preserving the Tibetan language and culture.\nHowever, some Tibetans have criticized the Chinese government's education policies, arguing that they are designed to assimilate Tibetan children into Chinese culture. Some Tibetans have also criticized the teaching of Mandarin Chinese, arguing that it is not relevant to their daily lives and does not prepare them for meaningful employment.\nWhile the Chinese government has invested heavily in Tibet in recent years, many Tibetans feel that their voices are not heard and that their concerns are not being addressed.\nTibetans have long complained about discrimination and human rights abuses by the Chinese government. The Chinese government has been accused of suppressing Tibetan culture and religion, as well as arbitrary detention and torture of Tibetan activists.\nIn recent years, the Chinese government has increased its surveillance and control of Tibetans, particularly in the wake of protests and self-immolations by Tibetans protesting Chinese rule.\nThe Chinese government has defended its policies in Tibet, arguing that they are necessary for national unity and stability. The government has also accused Tibetan activists of seeking independence and separatism, which it regards as a threat to national security.\nDespite the controversy surrounding Tibet and the Chinese government's policies in the region, it is clear that the Chinese government has invested heavily in Tibet in an effort to develop the region and improve the lives of Tibetans.\nHowever, the challenge for the Chinese government going forward will be to balance development and modernization with the preservation of Tibetan culture and traditions. This will require a more inclusive and transparent approach to governance in Tibet, as well as a greater willingness to listen to the concerns and aspirations of Tibetans.", "London, 26th March 2021: The traditional members of the Lloyd's of London insurance market are expected to keep declining, according to the CEO of major investor Blackstone Group Inc.\nSteve Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg TV that the traditional members of Lloyd\u2019s, known as \"names,\" who put up their personal wealth as collateral to back insurance policies, are rapidly dwindling. This follows a long-running trend of falling numbers, which he expects to continue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been going on for some time. They [names] have either been dying or retiring or deciding it\u2019s too risky,\u201d Schwarzman said.\nLloyd\u2019s, the world\u2019s oldest insurance market, has seen its traditional membership fall from around 34,000 in the 1980s to fewer than 3,000 today. The reason behind this decline is twofold: the increasing adoption of corporate-style capital through external investors and the difficulty for individuals to meet new regulatory requirements designed to protect policyholders.\nSchwarzman called for more external capital and institutional investors in Lloyd\u2019s, saying that Blackstone is \u201creally bullish\u201d on the market. After a difficult year for the insurance sector thanks to the pandemic and a string of natural disasters, Schwarzman sees Lloyd\u2019s as well positioned for the times ahead, with the capacity to assimilate significant amounts of capital.\nThe shift towards third-party capital has funded entry by insurance-linked securities (ILS) funds and institutional investors, which have grown by around \u00a37.5 billion ($10.3 billion) in recent years. Schwarzman has said institutional investors, such as Blackstone, are turning to insurance-linked markets to generate returns and hedge risks.\nDespite fears surrounding upcoming regulatory reforms and a recent tumultuous trading year, Lloyd\u2019s is still seen by many in the industry as a valuable destination for investors seeking to gain a foothold in the insurance market.\nThe influx of external capital has not gone unnoticed by traditional members, who feel their interests are being sidelined. However, with traditional members expected to keep declining, the Lloyd's market may continue its shift towards institutional investors and external capital.", "Santa Clara, California \u2013 Intel Corporation announced its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, exceeding Wall Street expectations and lifting its stock by more than 5%. The technology company has confirmed its status as a shooting star and remains a top pick in the tech sector.\nThe quarterly earnings report showed that Intel Corp generated a net income of $5.1 billion, or $1.11 per share, for the second quarter. This exceeded the analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.08 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The company's revenue also rose by more than 1% to $19.6 billion beating Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $17.8 billion.\n\"We achieved another outstanding quarter, surpassing $10 billion in revenue for the Data Center Group on continued strength in cloud and enterprise adoption,\" said Bob Swan, the Chief Executive Officer of Intel Corporation.\nThe data center group is Intel\u2019s major revenue generator, accounting for roughly a third of the company's total revenue. Strong demand for cloud computing and enterprise spending helped the company beat expectations, despite the slowing demand for personal computers and a pandemic-driven economic slowdown.\nIntel's data-centric strategy in the technology sector has been paying off, with the company earning a reputation as a dominant player in data center technology. The company reported more than $10 billion in revenue from its data center business throughout the quarter, up from the previous year's $7.1 billion, a staggering growth of 34%.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has affected the world's economy drastically, as many companies have been forced to cut costs and reduce staff. Intel had initially warned in April that it might miss its profit targets due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on demand. However, the company's profit was boosted by high demand for personal computer components and shift to remote work that has increased the demand for cloud computing and data center solutions.\nIntel's share price has been on the rise since the beginning of the year, gaining more than 23% year-to-date, recently reaching a 52-week high of $64.45. The recent earnings report has further powered Intel's stock, with shares trading at $59.18, up by more than 5%.\nThe company announced that it expects its third-quarter revenue to reach $18.2 billion, beating the analysts\u2019 forecast of $17.9 billion. Intel's management remains optimistic about the future, noting the demand in cloud computing and enterprise platforms, as well as 5G technology, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning trends.\nIntel's quarterly report has confirmed its status as a shooting star, with analysts impressed by the company's performance despite facing the unprecedented challenges this year. The report showed that Intel's steadfast focus on the data-centric business has paid off, cementing its position as a top pick in the tech sector.", "The war between Shanghai Film Studio and movie distributor Yongle has escalated, with the former now taking steps to fight back against the latter's aggressive expansion in China's cinema chain industry.\nThe feud between the two companies began when Yongle, which is backed by Internet giant Tencent, started to aggressively acquire cinemas across China in 2016. The move was seen by many as an attempt to take control of the country's lucrative cinema industry and put pressure on rivals, including Shanghai Film Studio.\nIn response, Shanghai Film Studio has been taking steps to defend its turf by opening more cinemas and partnering with other companies to boost its market position.\nOne of the most significant moves from Shanghai Film Studio has been its strategic alliance with leading Chinese cinema chain operator Wanda Cinemas in 2018. The partnership saw Shanghai Film Studio take a 30% stake in Wanda Cinemas, with the aim of improving its market competitiveness and expanding its global reach.\nHowever, Yongle has continued to expand aggressively, and its market share has grown substantially over the past few years. This has put increased pressure on Shanghai Film Studio and its partners, including Wanda Cinemas.\nNow, Shanghai Film Studio is fighting back with a new strategy that aims to boost its presence in China's cinema chain industry and counter Yongle's dominance.\nOne of the key elements of this strategy is Shanghai Film Studio's plan to acquire more cinemas across China. The company has already acquired several cinemas in Shanghai and other major Chinese cities, and it has announced plans to open more in the coming months.\nIn addition, Shanghai Film Studio has been building close relationships with other companies in the industry, including tech firms and cinema chain operators. These partnerships are designed to help the company access new markets and expand its reach into areas where Yongle has a strong presence.\nOne of the companies that Shanghai Film Studio has partnered with is Alibaba Pictures, the film arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant. The two companies have formed a strategic partnership that aims to boost their presence in China's cinema market and explore new opportunities in the sector.\nAnother company that Shanghai Film Studio has been working closely with is IMAX China. The two firms have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that aims to promote the development of the Chinese cinema chain industry and improve the viewing experience for audiences in China.\nThe MOU includes plans to expand the number of IMAX screens across China and to introduce new technologies and services that will enhance the cinema experience for viewers. This will help to improve Shanghai Film Studio's competitiveness in the market and make it more appealing to moviegoers across the country.\nShanghai Film Studio's CEO, Shi Dongming, has said that the company is committed to expanding its presence in the Chinese cinema industry and taking on Yongle's dominance.\n\"We are determined to defend our position in the Chinese cinema market and to provide our audiences with the best cinema experience possible,\" he said. \"We believe that our partnerships and strategic alliances will help us to achieve this goal and to grow our business in the coming years.\"\nThe battle for control of China's lucrative cinema industry is likely to continue in the coming months, with both Shanghai Film Studio and Yongle vying for dominance. However, with its new strategy and partnerships, Shanghai Film Studio is well placed to take on its rivals and secure its position as a leading player in the market.", "QBE Insurance Group, one of Australia's largest insurers, has predicted strong profit growth in the high teens for the full year 1996/97. The company's forecast comes amid growing optimism about the insurance industry's prospects.\nQBE CEO Frank O'Halloran announced the company's earnings guidance during a recent briefing, indicating that QBE's net profit would increase by 15 to 20 percent for the year ending June 30, 1997. The expected earnings surge is being driven by a combination of factors, including rising premiums and increasing demand for insurance products.\n\"We are very pleased with the progress we have made this year, and we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results for our shareholders,\" O'Halloran said.\nQBE's upbeat forecast reflects a broader trend in the insurance industry, with many insurers in Australia and beyond enjoying robust growth in recent years. A healthy economic environment has spurred demand for a range of insurance products, from home and motor insurance to travel and health coverage.\nAt the same time, insurers have benefitted from a rise in premiums, as customers become more willing to pay higher prices for coverage. This trend is particularly pronounced in the property and casualty sector, which has seen prices surge in the wake of natural disasters such as floods and bushfires.\nQBE has experienced this trend firsthand, with the company's gross written premiums rising by 10 percent in the first half of 1996/97, compared to the same period the previous year. The company's Australian and New Zealand operations saw particularly strong growth, with gross written premiums up 14 percent year-on-year.\nQBE's strong performance has been driven by a number of strategic decisions, including the acquisition of insurance businesses in Asia and the Americas. According to O'Halloran, the company's global presence has allowed it to take advantage of new opportunities and diversify its revenue streams.\n\u201cWe have been able to build a truly global business in today\u2019s fast-changing business environment,\" O'Halloran said. \"This has given us a broader range of products and services to offer to our customers and a more diverse range of risks in which we can participate.\"\nQBE's recent acquisitions include insurance businesses in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, as well as in Malaysia and Singapore. The company has also expanded its operations in the United States, with a particular focus on the property and casualty market.\nDespite the many positives for QBE and the broader insurance industry, there are potential challenges on the horizon. One of the main concerns for insurers is the potential impact of a global economic slowdown, which could reduce demand for insurance products and dampen premium growth.\nThere is also the issue of foreign exchange volatility, which could impact the profitability of insurers with global operations. This has been a particular concern for QBE over the past year, with the weakening of major currencies such as the Australian dollar and the British pound impacting the company's bottom line.\nDespite these challenges, O'Halloran remains optimistic about QBE's prospects for the year ahead.\n\"Our company is well positioned to navigate any challenges that may arise,\" he said. \"We have a strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio of businesses, and a committed team of employees who are focused on delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\"\nAs QBE and the broader insurance industry continue to thrive, investors are likely to keep a close eye on earnings reports and forecasts, looking for signs of further growth and expansion in the years ahead.", "At least 24 people have lost their lives in a series of clashes between Colombian soldiers and rebel fighters over the weekend. The fights took place in the southern province of Caquet\u00e1, where the notorious Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, has an active presence, making it a high-risk zone.\nAccording to a statement released by the Colombian military, the clashes occurred in three different locations. They said that the FARC insurgents attacked government troops who were on a routine patrol. The authorities say that the soldiers returned fire, and the firefight lasted for hours.\nThe Colombian Air Force was called in to support the ground troops, and government forces were able to successfully repel the militants. Three soldiers were killed in the line of duty, and another eleven were injured. It is not known how many FARC militants were killed or wounded in the clashes.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that there have been violent clashes involving the FARC. The group, which was founded in the 1960s, has been responsible for thousands of deaths in Colombia. The FARC is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Canada.\nSince 2016, the Colombian government has been in peace talks with the FARC in an effort to bring an end to the violence. In November of that year, they signed a peace agreement, but there have been reports of violations of the agreement by both sides.\nThe latest violence will come as a shock to the Colombian people, who have been hoping for an end to the violence for decades. A spokesperson for the government, who asked not to be named, said that they were extremely concerned about the situation and that they were working very hard to ensure that peace talks continued.\nThe Colombian authorities are calling on the FARC to respect the peace agreement that was signed in 2016 and to come back to the negotiating table to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.", "Amid the ongoing controversy surrounding Hong Kong's relationship with China, former chief justice Yang Ti Liang is vying to become the neutral and impartial leader the city deserves. Since the controversial passage of the National Security Law, many residents have expressed concern over China's tightening grip on Hong Kong's political and economic systems.\nLiang, who served as the chief justice from 2006 to 2010, has become a prominent advocate for preserving Hong Kong's autonomy and independence. He has called for a return to the principles of the Basic Law, which governs the special administrative region's relationship with China.\nIn an interview with the South China Morning Post, Liang stated that \"Hong Kong's success has been largely due to its open and transparent legal system, which ensures a level playing field for all residents and businesses. It is essential that we preserve this system in order to maintain a prosperous and secure Hong Kong.\"\nLiang's candidacy has been met with support from a wide variety of groups and individuals, including business leaders, academics, and civic organizations. Many view him as a symbol of Hong Kong's commitment to democracy and the rule of law, and believe that his experience and expertise make him well-suited to lead the city through these challenging times.\nHowever, Liang's candidacy has also sparked controversy among those who support closer integration with China. Some argue that Liang's stance on Hong Kong's autonomy is unrealistic in the current political climate, and that his candidacy will only serve to inflame tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China.\nDespite these concerns, Liang remains determined to pursue his candidacy, and has been actively campaigning both within Hong Kong and abroad. He has met with business leaders, community groups, and foreign dignitaries, and has been outspoken in his criticism of China's efforts to exert greater control over Hong Kong.\nLiang has also proposed a number of measures aimed at preserving Hong Kong's autonomy and independence, including the establishment of an independent commission to oversee the city's legal system, and the creation of a new revenue source to reduce the city's dependence on mainland China.\nMany believe that Liang's candidacy represents a significant turning point for Hong Kong, and that his leadership could help to restore confidence in the city's future. As the controversy over the National Security Law continues to rage on, Hong Kong's residents are looking for a leader they can trust to guide them through the challenges ahead.\nDespite the challenges facing Hong Kong, there are many who remain hopeful about the city's future and are working tirelessly to ensure that it remains a beacon of prosperity and democracy in the Asia-Pacific region. With the support of leaders like Yang Ti Liang, Hong Kong may yet emerge stronger and more secure than ever before.", "Canada\u2019s foremost stock exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), has hit a record high as trading closed on Friday with the help of strong financial and conglomerate stocks. The Toronto Stock Exchange Composite Index (SPTSX) advanced by 1.2%, or 210.35 points a new all-time high of 18,014.25. The previous all-time high of 17,977.5 was recorded in February 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\nThe positive performance was the result of a bullish rally in financial stocks. Major Canadian banks reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings, with Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank, and Bank of Montreal posting profits that exceeded analysts\u2019 forecasts. Boosted by these earnings, financial stocks surged by 1.7%.\nThe conglomerate stocks followed suit, with nearly all  the members of the TSX conglomerate sub-index registering gains. Brookfield Asset Management, the largest public listed alternative asset management firm in the world, was one of the gainers, posting a stock price rise of 3.1%. Other significant gains included the Canadian Tire Corporation Limited (up 2.5%) and Loblaw Company Limited (up 1.4%).\nMarket analysts attributed the buoyancy of the financial and conglomerate sectors of the TSX to improved economic indicators. The Bank of Canada\u2019s recent projection of a strong post-pandemic rebound is also a likely factor in the stock\u2019s positive performance.\nA report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives deemed the market's impressive run in recent months as \u201cdecoupled from reality\u201d. However, the report's view is not universally accepted, with some analysts pointing out that the global economy is booming. US retail sales surged in May, aiding economic recovery, and the US Federal Reserve has signaled that it won't raise interest rates anytime soon.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s record high is an encouraging sign for the overall Canadian economy as it signals a robust post-pandemic economic recovery. Analysts are hopeful that this performance will continue, creating wealth and greater economic opportunities for the country at large.", "Beijing \u2013 Despite a detente in bilateral trade tensions, Chinese officials issued a warning on Wednesday that more potential economic roadblocks loom between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nThe U.S. and China have been slowly warming their frosty relations, after a long trade war that saw the Trump administration slapping tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods. The Biden administration has backed off some of those, most recently in a proclamation lifting punitive tariffs on Canadian aluminum.\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Gao Feng, speaking at a routine press briefing, said both sides need to work together in order to create a fair and stable trading environment. \u201cChina and the US have different economic and social systems,\u201d Feng said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t want or expect to address every single issue within the scope of a single meeting or in a short while. The two sides should take realistic measures to prevent the escalation of trade friction.\u201d\nFeng noted that China has been following through with commitments made in the phase one agreement signed by China and the Trump administration last year, including increasing purchases of U.S. goods. The agreement saw China pledge to buy an additional $200 billion of American goods and services over two years.\nBut while China has made progress toward the agreement, other trade tensions continue to simmer. The U.S. and China also are at odds over the latter\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, its handling of Hong Kong and human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.\n\u201cWe need to expand market access and mutually beneficial cooperation, and make cooperation the centerpiece of Sino-US economic and trade relations,\u201d Feng said. \u201cThe two sides should jointly promote the healthy development of the global economy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, there are concerns that the ongoing trade tensions may escalate once again as China has unveiled a new five-year plan for economic and social development, which aims to reduce China\u2019s reliance on the West, increase domestic consumption and build a self-sufficient technology ecosystem. This shift could limit foreign access to Chinese markets, which pose a problem for American firms.\nMany observers believe that the Biden administration will continue some of the trade policies of its predecessor, as China currently sits under a cloud of sanctions that have only increased under Biden, including sanctions on Chinese companies that supply technology used to oppress Muslims in Xinjiang.\nAccording to a joint report by the National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations Development Programme, the value of U.S. trade with China has fallen by about 10% since 2018. However, some analysts predict that the Biden administration will still have to address outstanding issues in the U.S. relationship with China to avoid further escalation of tensions.\nWhether China\u2019s concerns will amount to anything substantive remains to be seen. However, officials in Beijing do want the world to know that they stand ready to confront any new barriers to trade or commerce with the US.", "Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese dissident, is facing a harsh sentence for his alleged involvement in a plot to overthrow the Chinese government. The 52-year-old activist has been a leading voice in China\u2019s democracy movement for over three decades, and his possible sentencing has sparked concerns about worsening human rights conditions in the country.\nWang Dan was one of the most prominent student leaders during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which were violently suppressed by the Chinese government. He was subsequently imprisoned for his role in the uprising and was released in 1993. Wang Dan later moved to the United States and continued his activism, calling for greater political freedoms in China.\nAccording to reports, Wang Dan was arrested in 2019 by Chinese authorities on suspicion of conspiring to overthrow the government. He was detained for several months without trial and was then released on bail, pending trial. However, he has been held under surveillance ever since.\nThe Chinese government alleges that Wang Dan was involved in a conspiracy to gather intelligence, incite unrest, and orchestrate a social media campaign to undermine the Communist Party\u2019s rule. The authorities say that he conspired with others to funnel foreign funds into the country for the purpose of fomenting political dissent.\nWang Dan has denied the charges against him and has maintained that he is a peaceful advocate for democracy and human rights in China. He has accused the Chinese government of using the legal system to suppress political dissent and silence its critics.\nWang Dan\u2019s case has been followed closely by human rights activists and governments around the world. His possible sentencing has been seen as a test of China\u2019s commitment to human rights and the rule of law. The Chinese government has been accused of using its legal system to punish political dissidents and curtail freedom of expression.\nEarlier this year, a group of prominent human rights organizations issued a joint statement calling on the Chinese government to release Wang Dan and other jailed democracy activists. The statement said that \u201cthe continued detention of Wang Dan and other peaceful activists violates international human rights law and runs counter to China\u2019s own commitment to the rule of law.\u201d\nThe statement went on to say that \u201cthe Chinese government should cease its harassment and imprisonment of peaceful advocates for democracy and human rights, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue and reform to advance these values.\u201d\nThe Chinese government has rejected these criticisms, calling them baseless and interference in its internal affairs. The authorities have said that they are simply enforcing the law and that those who violate it will be punished accordingly.\nThe Wang Dan case is just one example of the Chinese government\u2019s crackdown on dissent and criticism. In recent years, the Chinese authorities have detained thousands of activists, journalists, lawyers, and intellectuals who have spoken out against government policies and human rights violations.\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping has been accused of tightening control over the country\u2019s political and social spheres, and of cracking down on civil society organizations and independent media outlets. His government\u2019s policies have drawn criticism from the international community, which has called on China to respect human rights and the rule of law.\nThe sentencing of Wang Dan, if it does happen, is likely to have a chilling effect on China\u2019s already heavily circumscribed civil society. It could also lead to increased international pressure on China to improve its record on human rights and freedom of expression.\nThe Chinese government has repeatedly denied allegations of human rights abuses and has accused its critics of trying to destabilize the country. It remains to be seen how it will respond to the global outcry over the Wang Dan case and what the implications of his sentencing will be for China\u2019s political future.", "Redmond, Washington - Microsoft Corporation has decided to take on giants like Amazon and Alibaba.

The retail-dedicated machine learning technology is built to encode data from retailers with contextual information.\nMicrosoft plans to continue expanding their partnerships with retailers and brands to further entrench Dynamics 365 Commerce in the market, while actively pushing for better online shopping experiences for consumers.", "Nolan Bushnell, the founder of legendary video game company Atari, is looking to make a big comeback with his new venture, which is set to launch high-tech jukeboxes and video games in public places that are connected to the internet. The ambitious project aims to disrupt the music and gaming industries by offering a new way for people to interact with each other and their favorite game titles.\nThe new company, called X2 Games, was founded by Bushnell and his partners to explore the potential of technology to create immersive gaming experiences that engage people in new ways. According to Bushnell, X2 Games' jukeboxes and video games will have the ability to connect people in public spaces, creating new forms of social interaction and entertainment.\nThe jukeboxes will be interactive, allowing users to choose from a wide range of music genres and artists, as well as offering video content and interactive games. The machines will be connected to the internet, allowing users to access social media and other online features while they enjoy their music and entertainment. The games, on the other hand, will be based on popular titles from the video game industry, such as Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Missile Command.\nThe new machines are expected to be installed in public places such as shopping malls, movie theaters, and theme parks, providing a fun and engaging way for people to spend their leisure time. X2 Games is also looking to partner with music labels and video game publishers to offer exclusive content and titles to its customers.\n\"We are extremely excited about the potential of these new machines, which we believe will revolutionize the way people interact with each other and their favorite music and games,\" said Bushnell. \"By combining the benefits of technology and entertainment, we aim to make billions of dollars in revenue and create a new form of social interaction that will bring people together in public places.\"\nThe X2 Games team is made up of experienced video game designers, developers, and business executives who have worked on some of the most successful video game franchises in history. Some of the team members include Zai Ortiz, an award-winning game designer, and Scott Brown, a former executive at Electronic Arts, one of the biggest video game companies in the world.\nThe company has already secured funding from venture capitalists and private investors, and is working on developing prototypes of its new machines. The first machines are expected to be available for purchase by the end of this year, with installation planned for early 2022.\nIndustry experts believe that X2 Games has the potential to disrupt the traditional music and gaming industries by offering a new way for people to engage with these forms of entertainment. The machines could also provide a new revenue stream for public spaces such as shopping malls, which have been struggling to attract customers in recent years.\n\"While there is always a risk in launching a new product in an already crowded market, Nolan Bushnell has a proven track record of success in the gaming industry,\" said Steve Bailey, an analyst at IHS Markit. \"If X2 Games can deliver on its promise of offering a unique and interactive experience, then it could create a new market that will have significant potential for growing revenue.\"\nFor Bushnell, the new venture is a chance to make a big impact on the world of entertainment, just like he did when he co-founded Atari over 40 years ago. His vision for X2 Games is to create a new standard for social interaction and entertainment, using technology to bring people together in new and exciting ways.\n\"We want to inspire people to connect with each other in public places, to have fun and engage with their favorite music and games,\" said Bushnell. \"By offering a new way for people to interact with each other and their surroundings, we hope to create a new culture of social interaction that will change the world.\"", "Invesco Plc, the worldwide independent investment management company, has announced that it will merge with AIM Management Group Inc. to create one of the largest and most comprehensive investment management businesses in the world. The merger is anticipated to create a company with assets under management (AUM) exceeding $1.2 trillion, boosting Invesco's existing AUM of around $980 billion with AIM's $200 billion.\nIn a joint statement, the two companies revealed that the merger is expected to enable them to expand their range of investment solutions further, broaden distribution channels and leverage their respective investment capabilities and expertise to present superior investment opportunities for their customers globally.\n\"The merger of Invesco and AIM offers both companies a unique opportunity to leverage our shared strengths and capabilities to meet the evolving investment needs of institutional and retail investors worldwide,\" said Martin L.

Additionally, the merger is expected to provide a unique opportunity to capture cost synergies and growth opportunities, which would benefit both firms' clients, shareholders, and employees.", "Imperial Tobacco, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, is facing an uncertain future as it splits from its parent company, Hanson Plc. The move comes amid increasing threats of litigation against tobacco companies, which has put Imperial Tobacco in a precarious position.\nThe split from Hanson Plc marks the end of more than fifty years of association between the two companies. It was a difficult decision, but the management team at Imperial Tobacco felt it was necessary to protect the company's future in the face of mounting litigation.\n\"We are facing unprecedented litigation in the tobacco industry, and as a company, we need to be nimble and proactive in our approach to managing these challenges,\" explained John O'Shea, CEO of Imperial Tobacco.\nThe tobacco industry has faced increasing pressure in recent years as more and more countries implement strict anti-smoking laws and regulations. In addition, there has been a growing tide of litigation against tobacco companies, with individuals and governments seeking compensation for the health damage caused by smoking.\nImperial Tobacco has not been immune to these challenges. In 2019, the company was hit with a $6 billion lawsuit in Canada, which accused it of misleading customers about the risks associated with smoking. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and the outcome is uncertain.\nImperial Tobacco's split from Hanson Plc is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The move will involve the creation of a new company, which will be solely dedicated to the tobacco business. The new company will be managed by O'Shea, who is seen as a strong leader with a track record of turning businesses around.\nThe split has not been universally welcomed, however. Some analysts have raised concerns that the new company will struggle to compete in an industry that is facing increasing regulatory pressure and legal challenges.\n\"Imperial Tobacco will have to work hard to maintain its market position in an environment where smoking is increasingly viewed as a social evil,\" said Greg Barnes, a tobacco industry analyst at RBC Capital Markets.\nDespite these challenges, Imperial Tobacco remains confident that it can weather the storm. The company has a strong global brand, a loyal customer base, and a commitment to innovation.\n\"We are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products, while at the same time being responsible corporate citizens,\" said O'Shea.\nOnly time will tell if Imperial Tobacco's new strategy will be successful, but one thing is certain \u2013 the tobacco industry is facing a period of unprecedented change, and companies like Imperial Tobacco will have to adapt to survive.", "The British biotech firm, Acme Pharmaceuticals, has announced that its new cancer drug has shown promising results in early clinical trials. However, analysts are urging caution as more testing is needed to determine its effectiveness and potential side effects.\nThe drug, named ACME-123, is designed to target a specific protein found in certain types of cancer cells. According to Acme Pharmaceuticals, the drug has been successful in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and inducing cell death in laboratory tests and early-stage clinical trials.\nThe trials involved a small group of patients with various types of cancer, including lung, breast, and colon cancer. In these trials, ACME-123 was administered orally in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. The results showed promising reductions in tumor size and improved patient outcomes.\nHowever, analysts warn that this is just the beginning of a long process, and it remains unclear whether ACME-123 will prove to be a breakthrough treatment for cancer or just another drug that doesn't pass the rigorous testing process. Many drugs that have shown promise in early trials have failed in larger, more comprehensive studies.\n\u201cWhile the early results of ACME-123 are certainly encouraging, there is still a long way to go before we can say whether this drug will be effective in treating cancer patients,\u201d said Dr. John Smith, an oncologist at Harvard Medical School.\nAcme Pharmaceuticals has stated that it will continue to test the drug on a larger group of patients in advanced-stage clinical trials. These trials will assess the drug's safety and effectiveness over a longer period of time and in a more diverse group of patients.\nThe success of ACME-123 is of great importance to the biotech industry, which has been struggling to develop effective cancer drugs. Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with over 9.6 million deaths reported in 2018.\nMoreover, cancer drugs are notoriously difficult to develop as they must target cancer cells without harming healthy ones. Many drugs that show promise in early trials do not make it to the market due to unforeseen side effects.\nAcme Pharmaceuticals is not the only company developing cancer drugs. In fact, the field is highly competitive and there are many other firms working on similar treatments. However, the success of ACME-123 could be a significant breakthrough in the fight against cancer.\nDespite this, analysts caution against becoming too optimistic about the drug's potential. There is still a great deal of work to be done before ACME-123 can be approved for use by patients.\n\u201cWhile we are excited by the early results, it is important to remember that developing cancer drugs is a long journey, and many challenges still need to be overcome,\u201d said Becky Jones, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\nThe next phases of clinical trials for ACME-123 are expected to take several years to complete. Only then will we have a better idea of whether this drug can provide real hope for cancer patients. For now, the industry is watching closely and cautiously optimistic about what the future holds.", "Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, has managed to maintain steady shipments of cocoa from its major port in Abidjan despite the Covid-19 pandemic. Currently, the port maintains a stockpile of 90,000 tonnes of cocoa, according to the managing director of the cocoa and coffee council, Yves Kone.\nDespite the fear of disruption to the cocoa industry due to the pandemic, business at Ivory Coast's major port remains relatively unaffected. In fact, government efforts to contain the virus have been impressive, and it has allowed the country to maintain its position as the world's leading exporter of cocoa.\nThe government has implemented strict transportation protocols for trucks entering and leaving the country in an effort to curb the spread of the virus without disrupting exports. Additionally, cocoa farms and processing plants have remained open and have continued to operate normally. This has ensured a continued flow of cocoa from the country to international markets.\nThe Ivory Coast's cocoa industry is a significant contributor to the country's economic growth and development. The country produces over 40% of the world's cocoa, and it is a crucial source of income for thousands of farmers and their communities.\nDespite the current stable situation, the industry has faced challenges in the past, most notably the issue of child labor. The government has addressed this issue by implementing programs such as school enrollment campaigns and the provision of farming equipment to help reduce the responsibility of children on cocoa farms.\nIn conclusion, while many industries have been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Ivory Coast's cocoa industry appears to be weathering the storm. The country's ability to maintain steady shipments and a substantial stockpile of cocoa is a testament to the government's effective response to the pandemic. As a result, the Ivory Coast's cocoa industry is well-positioned to continue to supply the global market with one of the world's favorite sweets.", "Virgin Atlantic Cargo has announced a new shorter route for its Hong Kong to London service, cutting journey time by one hour and increasing freight capacity. The new direct service will operate from Hong Kong International Airport to London Heathrow Airport.\nThe airline\u2019s new route will reduce journey times by one hour, making it a more attractive option for shippers transporting goods between Hong Kong and London. The new service will also offer customers increased freight capacity, ensuring that they can transport larger shipments with ease.\nVirgin Atlantic Cargo is one of the world\u2019s leading air cargo carriers. It operates a fleet of Boeing 747-400 aircraft, capable of transporting up to 110 tonnes of freight. The carrier has a network of routes covering destinations across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\nThe new Hong Kong to London service will further strengthen Virgin Atlantic Cargo\u2019s presence in the Asian market.

The carrier also operates flights to Tokyo, Japan, and Hong Kong, among other destinations.\nDominic Kennedy, Managing Director of Virgin Atlantic Cargo, said: \u201cWe are constantly striving to improve our services and offer our customers the best possible options for their freight shipments. The new direct service from Hong Kong to London is a great example of that commitment, offering faster journey times and increased freight capacity.

With its shorter journey times and increased capacity, the service is expected to be popular with businesses looking to transport goods quickly and efficiently between Asia and Europe.", "In what is sure to be a controversial announcement, Dr. Thomas Larson, the physician who facilitated the world's first legal mercy killing, has announced that he will be making the software and instructions for his death machine available on the internet.\nThe death machine, which Dr. Larson designed and built himself, allows terminally ill patients to end their own lives at the push of a button. It has been used in three cases so far, all of which were deemed legal by the state of California.\nDr. Larson, who has become an outspoken advocate for the right to die movement, says that he is making the instructions available in order to give patients the power to decide their own fates.\n\"I firmly believe that every person has the right to end their own life on their own terms,\" Dr. Larson said in a statement. \"This machine gives them that freedom and now, through the internet, more people will have access to it.\"\nThe decision has been met with strong criticism from some quarters, with opponents arguing that it is unethical to promote suicide and that Dr. Larson is putting vulnerable people at risk.\n\"Suicide is never the answer, no matter what the circumstances,\" said Angela Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Suicide Prevention. \"To promote it as a viable option is not only unethical, it's dangerous.\"\nOthers, however, have come out in support of Dr. Larson's decision, arguing that it is a necessary step in the fight for the right to die.\n\"This is a watershed moment for the right to die movement,\" said Dr. Mary Johnson, a physician and advocate for end-of-life choices. \"Dr. Larson's death machine has already helped give countless people the peace of mind knowing that they can end their own suffering when they choose to. And now, with the instructions available online, even more people will have access to this important tool.\"\nDr. Larson has emphasized that the instructions will only be available to those who are terminally ill and who have been assessed by a physician as having a life expectancy of six months or less.\n\"We are not encouraging anyone to end their life prematurely or without careful consideration,\" he said. \"This is about giving people the power to make their own choices, to feel in control of their own lives, even in the face of something as devastating as a terminal illness.\"\nAs for concerns that his decision could lead to an increase in suicides, Dr. Larson says that research has shown that giving people the option of a peaceful, painless death actually reduces the rate of suicides.\n\"The reality is that people who are terminally ill and in extreme pain are already at a heightened risk of suicide,\" he said. \"By giving them a safe, controlled option, we are actually decreasing that risk.\"\nWhile it remains to be seen what the long-term impact of Dr. Larson's decision will be, it's clear that the debate over the right to die will continue to be a contentious one.\nFor those who support the right to die movement, the release of the instructions is a step forward in a fight for autonomy and dignity in death. For those who oppose it, the decision represents a dangerous shift towards promoting suicide and minimizing the value of life.\nRegardless of which side you fall on, what's clear is that the release of Dr. Larson's instructions will spark an important conversation about the ethics of end-of-life choices and the role of physicians in facilitating them.", "General Motors has been forced to idle around 5,000 workers at its Ohio plant due to the ongoing Canadian autoworker strike. The strike has caused disruptions in the supply chain, leaving GM with a shortage of parts for its operations in the United States.\nLast week, around 3,800 workers at the CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ontario went on strike after negotiations between Unifor Local 88 and GM broke down. The strike was sparked by Unifor's demand for job security, as GM had announced plans to move production of its Chevrolet Equinox to Mexico.\nThe strike has created a ripple effect, causing supply chain issues and other problems for GM's operations in the United States. In Ohio, where GM operates a transmission plant, the automaker has been forced to idle around 5,000 workers due to parts shortages.\nIn an official statement, GM said, \"While we believe General Motors and Unifor have an agreement that benefits employees in Canada, General Motors has decided to idle our Lordstown assembly plant due to the parts shortage caused by the Unifor strike.\"\nGM has not stated when it expects the plant to reopen, but the company has promised to work with suppliers to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Some analysts have suggested that the strike could last for several weeks, putting additional pressure on GM and other automakers that rely on the Canadian supply chain.\nThe Canadian autoworker strike has highlighted the complex nature of the global automotive industry, with supply chain disruptions in one location impacting operations in another part of the world. It has also reignited debates around job security and the role of unions in protecting workers' rights in the era of globalization and growing automation.\nAs the strike continues, workers in Ohio and other affected states are being forced to take unpaid leave, with many expressing frustration and anxiety about the uncertainty of their employment situation. For GM and other automakers, the strike is a reminder of the importance of strong and stable supply chains, as well as the need to balance the demands of workers with the pressures of global competition.", "Beijing, China - The Chinese government has recently sounded a warning on the state of the country's trade relationship with the United States, hinting at possible retaliation over punitive charges, in an escalating conflict with the Trump administration.\nThe cautionary statement was issued by China's Commerce Ministry, in response to the U.S. government's decision to impose steep tariffs on imported aluminium and steel earlier this month. Beijing has since warned that it is prepared to take action to safeguard its interests, including imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, should the U.S. government fail to reverse its decision.\nAccording to a statement released by the Ministry, the U.S. tariffs \"seriously violate WTO rules and damage the interests of China and other WTO members\", adding that China \"has already announced that it will take necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\nThis move by Beijing has raised the stakes in an increasingly acrimonious trade dispute between the two countries. The U.S. tariffs were signed into law by President Trump on March 8th, citing national security reasons as justification for the actions. This move was met with widespread criticism from China and many other U.S. trading partners, who viewed the actions as a violation of WTO regulations.\nChina has already indicated that it will target U.S. soybeans, planes, and other products for potential retaliation, in what could be a major escalation in the trade war between the two countries. This could potentially lead to a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the two countries, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's products.\nThe threat of retaliatory tariffs has already sent shockwaves through the business community, with many businesses and farmers fearing the fallout of a possible trade war. The U.S. agricultural industry is particularly vulnerable to any potential retaliation, as they rely heavily on exports for their livelihood.\nDespite the warning from Beijing, the Trump administration remains steadfast in its position, citing concerns over the U.S. trade deficit with China, which is estimated to have reached $375 billion last year.\nThe President and his advisers have long accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, and of unfairly subsidizing its own industries, in what they view as a distorted trade relationship. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese goods, claiming that this is necessary to protect U.S. industries and jobs.\nThe Chinese government, for its part, has strongly denied these allegations, and has accused the U.S. of acting unilaterally to undermine free trade and the global trading system. In a statement released earlier this month, China's Foreign Ministry said that \"China is resolutely opposed to this kind of unilateralism and protectionism, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its own rights and interests and the multilateral trading system.\"\nAs the rhetoric between the two countries heats up, many analysts are warning that the situation could spiral out of control, leading to a damaging protracted trade war that could have serious ramifications on both sides. The U.S. economy, in particular, could be hit hard by any potential retaliation, as exports account for a significant portion of its GDP.", "Former British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, has challenged businesses to defend the rule of law in the city ahead of China's takeover. Patten, who served as the last governor of the former British colony from 1992 to 1997, said that the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong by the Chinese government poses a threat to international businesses operating within the city.\nPatten's comments come as China prepares to mark the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party's founding on July 1st, which also marks the day that Hong Kong was handed over to Chinese sovereignty by the British. Patten spoke at an event organized by the Hong Kong Democratic Party, stating that the Chinese government is increasingly seeking to undermine the rule of law and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.\nPatten said that businesses must defend these values or risk being seen as complicit in China's attempts to curb democracy in the city. \"I would call upon all those who invest in Hong Kong and all those who have an interest in its prosperity and freedoms to stand up and be counted. To ensure that investment is not seen as entrenching a Chinese Communist Party grip on Hong Kong,\" he said.\nHong Kong has seen a crackdown on democracy in recent years, with China imposing a controversial national security law in June 2020. The law criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say the law is vague and open to abuse by the Chinese government, allowing it to silence dissenting voices in the city.\nPatten said that the national security law is the biggest challenge to Hong Kong's freedoms since the handover, and accused China of breaking its promises to the people of Hong Kong. \"And we know that the national security law is being used brutally to suppress those who stand up for the values that we took for granted in Hong Kong,\" he said.\nPatten's comments drew criticism from some pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong. Regina Ip, a former security chief and now a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, said that Patten was \"ill-informed\" and accused him of \"interfering\" in the city's affairs. Ip also claimed that businesses in Hong Kong were \"thriving\" under Chinese rule.\nHowever, many pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong applauded Patten's comments, saying they were a valuable reminder of the need to defend the city's freedoms. \"It's important for leaders from around the world to speak up about what's happening in Hong Kong. We need all the support we can get,\" said Nathan Law, a prominent pro-democracy activist who fled Hong Kong for the UK in 2020.\nInternational businesses have faced increasing pressure to speak out on the situation in Hong Kong, with human rights groups calling on them to defend the city's freedoms. In April, a coalition of more than 50 human rights groups wrote a letter to companies including Apple, Amazon, and Google, urging them to resist the Chinese government's attempts to curtail freedom in Hong Kong.\nPatten's challenge to businesses comes as the debate over Hong Kong's future intensifies. Some pro-democracy activists have called for foreign governments to intervene to protect Hong Kong's freedoms, while others argue that the city's best hope is to work within the framework of Chinese sovereignty.\nWhatever the outcome, Patten's comments serve as a stark reminder of the challenges facing Hong Kong, and the need for businesses to play a role in defending the city's freedoms. As the Chinese government seeks to tighten its grip on the city, the world will be watching to see how businesses respond.", "Investors across the globe have shown renewed interest in Canadian stocks as the country's economic fundamentals continue to improve. According to recent data, the Canadian economy has recovered strongly from the pandemic-induced recession, and this has bolstered investor confidence in the country's stock market.\nCanada's unemployment rate has dropped steadily in recent months, and consumer spending has rebounded sharply since the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Moreover, the country's housing market has been booming, with home prices reaching record highs in many cities. This has fueled growth in the construction sector, which has in turn created new job opportunities.\nThese positive economic indicators have not gone unnoticed by investors, who have been flocking to Canadian stocks in droves. The S&P/TSX Composite Index, which tracks the performance of Canada's biggest companies, has been on a steady upward trajectory since the beginning of the year. As of August 2021, the index is up by over 15% year-to-date, outpacing many other major stock markets.\nExperts attribute this uptick in investor interest to Canada's strong economic fundamentals, as well as the country's sound fiscal policies. \"Canada has a stable political environment, a highly educated workforce, and a diverse economy that spans multiple sectors,\" says John Smith, a portfolio manager at a Toronto-based investment firm. \"These factors make it an attractive destination for investors who are looking for long-term growth potential.\"\nThe Canadian government has also been proactive in supporting the country's economic recovery. It has rolled out several stimulus packages aimed at helping businesses and individuals weather the pandemic, as well as investing in key infrastructure projects that are expected to create jobs and boost economic growth. These measures have been well-received by both businesses and investors, who see them as a sign of the government's commitment to economic stability and growth.\nLooking ahead, many investors remain bullish on Canadian stocks, despite the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. They point to the country's robust economic fundamentals and the government's commitment to supporting growth as factors that will continue to drive investor interest in the years to come.\nAs the world continues to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, Canada's strong economic performance and sound fiscal policies have positioned it as a stable and attractive destination for investors. With the country's economic recovery showing no signs of slowing down, it is likely that investor interest in Canadian stocks will continue to remain high for the foreseeable future.", "As the global oil and gas industry navigates its way through major market shifts, foreign companies have been quick to snap up undervalued Australian oil and gas stocks.\nSince the 2015 oil price crash, the Australian oil and gas sector has struggled, with many small-to-medium sized companies going under. This resulted in many of their assets becoming available for foreign companies to buy, with favorable exchange rates making them particularly enticing.\nRecent data shows that foreign ownership of Australia\u2019s oil and gas resources has surged to more than 50% in the past decade. According to the Australian Energy Regulator, gas market deregulation has been a factor in attracting foreign investment, as increased competition creates more opportunities for smaller players to enter the market.\nBut despite the increased foreign investment, analysts say that the Australian oil and gas sector has a promising future with higher oil prices and a deregulated gas market.\nOil prices have been bouncing back since 2016, and many analysts believe that prices will continue to increase. This will lead to more investment in exploration and production, as well as increase the profitability of the sector. Additionally, the deregulation of the gas sector is expected to create new opportunities and increase competition, leading to more investment in exploration and production.\nWhile the increase in foreign investment has raised concerns about Australia\u2019s long-term energy security, analysts note that foreign investment can lead to knowledge transfer and technology sharing that ultimately benefits Australia.\nMoreover, Australia\u2019s recently launched Gas-fired Recovery Plan seeks to address energy security concerns, and encourage further investment in the sector. The plan has identified 13 priority projects, with the aim of securing reliable and affordable energy supply across the country.\nDespite this, challenges remain. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the energy sector hard, and the closure of international borders has impacted foreign investment. Additionally, the push towards renewable energy has left some questioning whether investment in the oil and gas sector will be sustainable in the long run.\nHowever, analysts argue that the world will continue to rely on oil and gas, especially as the demand for energy is expected to grow with population growth and urbanization. While the world shifts towards renewable energy, oil and gas will remain an important source of energy to meet demand, at least in the short to medium term.\nUltimately, while foreign companies have taken advantage of the current market conditions and targeted undervalued Australian oil and gas assets, there is reason to be optimistic about the future of the sector. With higher oil prices and gas market deregulation, the sector is poised for growth and investment. The challenge will be navigating the global market shifts and staying ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing energy industry.", "PARIS \u2013 The fate of France's second largest airline Air Liberte still hangs in the balance, as the deadline for bids to acquire the financially troubled company passed on Monday with not a single solid offer on the table.\nAir Liberte, which carries around 2 million passengers a year, operates on a budget airline model, focusing on leisure routes from Paris to Mediterranean destinations such as Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. It has been struggling for years, failing to make a profit in 2020 due to the pandemic, which hit the aviation industry hard.\nIts owner, the Franco-Dutch investment firm Groupe Dubreuil, last year announced plans to find a new partner or sell the company entirely. The news was met with concern from employees, who feared job losses and the potential disappearance of their airline. The French government has also taken an interest in the situation, as it seeks to maintain a competitive aviation market.\nThe deadline for bids to be submitted was set at June 7, but so far none of the potential buyers have come forward with a concrete proposal. Air France-KLM, which recently launched a low-cost subsidiary called Transavia France, said it did not plan to bid for Air Liberte. Other potential investors include the Irish carrier Ryanair, and the Tunisian airline Syphax Airlines, though it is unclear if they have submitted bids.\nAir Liberte's future is now uncertain, with the possibility of it being liquidated or otherwise restructured looming. The airline's employees have expressed their frustration at the situation, with some taking to the streets outside the company's headquarters in Paris to protest.\n\"We are all very concerned about what will happen to us,\" said Francois, a cabin crew member who has worked for Air Liberte for five years. \"We hope that someone will step in and save our company, but it's not looking good.\"\nThe situation has also raised questions about the future of the French aviation industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic and faces stiff competition from low-cost carriers. Many in the industry are calling for more government support to ensure that French airlines can remain competitive and avoid being forced out of business.\n\"The French government needs to do more to support our industry and ensure that we can survive in this difficult market,\" said Philippe, a pilot for a French airline. \"Without help, we risk losing our airlines and our jobs, which would be a huge blow to the economy.\"\nThe French government has not yet commented on the situation with Air Liberte, but has previously expressed concern about the future of the aviation industry. In a recent interview, Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said that he was working on a plan to support French airlines, but declined to give any details.\nThe fate of Air Liberte remains uncertain, but its employees and many in the aviation industry are hoping that a solution can be found before it's too late. The next few weeks will be crucial, as the airline's future hangs in the balance. Few believe it can continue operating as normal, but what exactly will happen next remains to be seen.", "Toronto Stock Market Edges Closer to Breaking All-Time High\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) is approaching an all-time high as it closes in on the 20,000 mark. The TSX has been on a steady rise over the past year despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty.\nThe TSX has been bolstered by a strong performance from the technology sector, which has been on an upward trajectory since last year. In particular, Shopify Inc., Canada's leading e-commerce company, has been a powerhouse, with its stock price increasing by over 400% since the beginning of 2020. Other tech companies, such as Lightspeed POS Inc. and Descartes Systems Group Inc., have also experienced significant growth and contributed to the sector's success.\nThe mining sector has also played a role in the TSX's rise, with increased demand for commodities such as gold and copper leading to higher prices for mining companies. The energy sector has also experienced some rebound in recent months due to an increase in oil prices.\nThe potential of the TSX breaking its all-time high is exciting for investors, but it could also signal a broader economic recovery for Canada after a tumultuous year. Some analysts warn, however, that a single event, such as a negative financial report from a large company or a sudden change in government policy, could cause a setback.\nDespite some caution, many investors remain optimistic about the TSX's potential. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has recently increased its holdings in the exchange, and many analysts predict that the strong performance of the tech sector will continue to drive growth.\nFor now, all eyes are on the TSX, waiting to see if it will break its all-time high and continue to push the Canadian economy towards recovery.", "Alex Mahon, the CEO of Channel 4, has urged the UK government to reject any plans for privatisation of the broadcaster. Speaking to the Broadcasting Press Guild, Mahon argued that Channel 4 provides vital public service broadcasting that would be endangered by private ownership.\nMahon stated, \"A privatised Channel 4 would no longer have the same commitment to serving the public good. Our programming would be driven by profit rather than public service aims, and the unique and diverse voices we aim to represent would be lost.\"\nThe government has been considering options for privatising Channel 4 since 2016, when an independent review suggested that it could raise up to \u00a31 billion. However, opponents argue that privatisation would lead to a decline in the quality of programming and a loss of independent political coverage.\nIn her address, Mahon rejected the argument that Channel 4 could not compete in a rapidly changing media landscape without privatisation. She pointed to the success of the channel's recent programming, including the drama series It's a Sin and the documentary series Black to Front.\nShe also highlighted the public support for Channel 4's public service broadcasting, citing a recent survey that showed 75% of respondents wanted the broadcaster to remain publicly owned.\nMahon acknowledged that Channel 4 faces challenges in a post-pandemic world, including competition from streaming services and declining advertising revenue. However, she argued that these challenges could be addressed through greater commercial flexibility within the current public ownership structure, rather than through privatisation.\nMahon's call was supported by industry figures, including the actor and comedian Stephen Fry, who tweeted his agreement: \"I couldn't agree with her more. Channel 4 provides vital public service programming that enriches our cultural and civic life. Let's keep it public.\"\nThe government has not yet announced whether it intends to proceed with privatisation plans, but the continued opposition of Channel 4's leadership and public figures will add weight to the argument for public ownership.", "The Czech Republic has forecasted a record tourism income of $5 billion in 1996, providing an economic boost amid trade deficits. This unprecedented growth is a result of the country's efforts to promote its rich history, cultural heritage, and modern attractions.\nThe Czech Republic's tourism industry is expected to create numerous job opportunities and increase exports of goods and services, providing a much-needed lifeline to the struggling economy.\nExperts have attributed this growth to the country's focus on tourism as an essential sector in their economic development strategy. The government has actively supported it through the creation of tourist-friendly policies and investments in infrastructure.\nThe country's largest tourism markets are Central Europe, Germany, and Italy. However, they aim to diversify their target markets by tapping into Asia, and particularly China, where the middle class is increasingly travelling abroad.\nFurthermore, the Czech Republic's cultural heritage has a significant role in its tourism industry. The country boasts of twelve UNESCO World Heritage sites, which includes Prague's historic centre, a magnificent castle in southern Bohemia's Cesky Krumlov, and the Kutna Hora's medieval silver mines.\nPrague, the Czech Republic's capital, is also renowned for its architecture, which blends Roman and Gothic styles with more recent art nouveau influences. The city's cobblestone streets, secluded courtyards, and remarkable landmarks have attracted tourists from around the world.\nThe growth in tourism has also impacted the country's hospitality industry, with an increase in the number of hotels, restaurants, and cafes. The country's government has also passed regulations aimed at improving transparency and the quality of services.\nThe Czech Republic's forecasted tourism income is expected to have a significant impact on the country's foreign exchange earnings, which have a substantial impact on the economy. Additionally, the industry reduces the country's dependence on imports, creating jobs locally and supporting small and medium-sized businesses.\nIn conclusion, the Czech Republic continues to be a prime tourist destination, attracting tourists with literature, art, music, and history. The government's efforts to promote the tourism industry through friendly policies, investing in infrastructure, and preserving its rich history ensure the industry's continued growth. The sector's success is helping the country's economy amid trade deficits and providing opportunities to create jobs and strengthen its foreign exchange earnings.", "Simsmetal Ltd, one of the leading metal recycling companies in the world, has warned its shareholders that it expects a decline in its profits due to the tough outlook for scrap metal prices. The company, which is headquartered in Australia and has operations in more than 20 countries, attributed the bleak outlook to various factors such as the ongoing trade tensions between major economies and the slowdown in global manufacturing.\nIn a statement released to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), Simsmetal management said that the drop in scrap metal prices was not unexpected but the severity and the duration of the decline were unpredictable. \"We are currently experiencing a significant reduction in the margins across all our business units due to the challenging market conditions,\" the statement said. \"We expect our results to be impacted in the near term, and we are taking steps to mitigate the risks and stabilize the financial performance of the company.\"\nThe warning from Simsmetal comes at a time when the prices of scrap metal have been volatile. The most widely-traded benchmark for scrap metal, the HMS 1&2 (80:20), has been on a downward trend since August 2019, dropping from over $330 per metric tonne to around $230 by the end of October. Analysts have attributed the decline to a combination of factors, such as the ongoing trade spat between the US and China, the weakness in global car sales, and the overcapacity in the steel industry.\nThe slump in scrap metal prices has been felt across the globe, with metal recycling companies reporting lower profits and reduced activity. In the UK, for example, the scrap metal prices have been under pressure due to the Brexit uncertainty and the weakening of the pound. The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) warned earlier this month that the UK scrap metal market was facing a \"perfect storm\" of challenges, including the increased regulation, rising costs, and sluggish demand.\nIn the US, the scrap metal industry is also struggling with the lower prices and the trade war with China. According to a recent report by the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), the US scrap exports to China fell by almost 25% in the first half of 2019 compared to the same period last year. The report also noted that the tariffs imposed by China on US scrap metal had resulted in \"significant disruption\" to the industry, causing a backlog of materials and raising the storage costs for recyclers.\nSimsmetal, which has a diverse portfolio of products and services ranging from scrap metal collection to steel production, said that it was reviewing its operations and costs to adapt to the changing market conditions. The company's CEO, Alistair Field, said in a recent interview that the company was focusing on maximizing the value of its current assets and exploring new growth opportunities. \"We are aware of the challenges in the market, but we also see some positive signs such as the growing awareness of the importance of recycling and the increasing demand for sustainable products,\" he said.\nDespite the gloomy outlook for scrap metal prices, some industry experts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the sector. They point out that the increasing emphasis on sustainability and circular economy could create new opportunities for metal recycling companies, as more companies look for ways to reduce their carbon footprint and cut down on waste. They also note that the development of new technologies and the investment in infrastructure could improve the efficiency and profitability of the sector.\nIn conclusion, Simsmetal's warning about the decline in its profits due to the tough outlook for scrap metal prices underscores the challenges facing the metal recycling industry. However, the sector has shown resilience in the face of adversity, and there are reasons to be optimistic about its future. As the world grapples with the environmental and economic challenges of the 21st century, the importance of metal recycling is likely to increase, providing opportunities for innovative companies like Simsmetal to lead the way.", "Russia's diamond industry, which is one of the largest in the world, is currently facing a period of uncertainty, as tax officials seek a larger cut from exports. The country's tax authorities are reportedly demanding higher tax rates on diamond exports, which would have a significant impact on the industry's profitability. At the same time, the industry's relationship with diamond giant De Beers is also causing concern, as a long-standing agreement between the two parties is reportedly up for review.\nAccording to reports, Russia's Federal Tax Service is seeking to impose a 15% tax on rough diamonds exports, up from the current rate of 6.5%. The move is seen as an attempt to boost revenue for the government, which is currently grappling with a range of economic challenges. However, the tax hike would also have a major impact on the diamond industry, which is responsible for a significant portion of Russia's exports.\nThe diamond industry in Russia is primarily concentrated in the Yakutia region, where several mines are located. These mines are operated by a range of companies, including Alrosa, which is one of the world's largest diamond producers. In recent years, the industry has faced a range of challenges, including fluctuating diamond prices, rising operating costs, and an unstable regulatory environment.\nThe proposed tax hike comes at a time when the industry is already struggling to maintain profitability. In recent years, the price of diamonds has been subject to significant volatility, which has impacted the bottom line for many companies. In addition, operating costs have been rising, which has put pressure on profit margins. The proposed tax hike would only serve to exacerbate these challenges, and many in the industry are concerned about the long-term impact on the sector.\nIn addition to the tax issue, the diamond industry is also facing uncertainty over its relationship with De Beers, the largest diamond mining company in the world. For many years, De Beers has had a sales agreement with Alrosa, which has provided a stable distribution channel for Russian diamonds. However, this agreement is reportedly up for review, and there are concerns that De Beers may not renew the deal.\nIf this were to happen, it could have significant implications for the Russian diamond industry, as it would be forced to find new buyers for its diamonds. This would be a challenging task, as the industry is already highly fragmented, and there are few established channels for diamond distribution outside of De Beers.\nAccording to industry analysts, the uncertainty over the tax issue and the De Beers agreement is causing significant concern within the industry. Many companies are reportedly holding off on major investments until there is more clarity on these issues, and there are fears that this could lead to a slowdown in production.\nDespite these challenges, however, there are also reasons for optimism within the industry. Diamond prices have rebounded somewhat in recent months, and there is growing demand for diamonds in emerging markets such as China and India. This could provide a boost to the industry in the medium term, although the challenges posed by the tax issue and the De Beers agreement will need to be addressed if the industry is to realize its full potential.\nIn response to the tax hike proposal, the industry is reportedly lobbying the government to reconsider its position. Many industry players argue that the proposed tax rate is too high, and could make Russian diamonds uncompetitive on the global market. They are also calling for more supportive policies from the government, including measures to reduce operating costs and improve infrastructure.\nFor now, the future of the Russian diamond industry remains uncertain. While there are reasons for optimism, the challenges posed by the tax issue and the De Beers agreement are significant, and will need to be carefully managed if the industry is to thrive in the years ahead.", "As China's pro-democracy movement grows stronger, the government is cracking down on activists who are pushing for greater freedoms. In recent months, many activists have vanished without a trace, and their families and supporters fear the worst.\nThe latest wave of activism started in 2019, with the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The protests, which were sparked by a proposed extradition law that would have allowed China to extradite people from Hong Kong to mainland China, quickly escalated into demands for greater democracy and autonomy for Hong Kong.\nThe protests were met with brutal police violence, and many activists were arrested. Though the protests eventually died down, the pro-democracy movement continued to gain momentum. Activists continued to push for greater democracy and human rights, despite the risks.\nBut since the passing of China's National Security Law in 2020, things have gotten much worse for pro-democracy activists. The law, which was imposed on Hong Kong without the approval of its legislature, criminalizes any act of \"secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces.\"\nSince the law was passed, the Chinese government has been using it to crack down on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and mainland China. Many activists have been arrested and charged with crimes related to the National Security Law.\nBut some activists have vanished without a trace. According to Human Rights Watch, at least twelve activists have disappeared since the National Security Law was passed. Their families and friends have no idea where they are or if they are even alive.\nOne of those activists is a journalist named Zhang Zhan. Zhang was arrested in May 2020, after she reported on the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. She was charged with \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble,\" a common charge used against activists in China.\nIn December 2020, Zhang was sentenced to four years in prison. But since then, her family has received no information about her whereabouts or condition. They fear that she may have been tortured or mistreated in detention.\nAnother activist who has disappeared is a lawyer named Gao Zhisheng. Gao is a well-known human rights lawyer who has been imprisoned and tortured by the Chinese government in the past. He vanished in August 2017, and his family has not heard from him since.\nThese disappearances have raised fears that China's government is using enforced disappearance as a tool to silence pro-democracy activists. Enforced disappearance is a crime under international law and is defined as \"the arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the state, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person.\"\nIf China's government is using enforced disappearance, it would be a serious violation of human rights and would be condemned by the international community.\nBut China's government has denied any involvement in the disappearances. When asked about Zhang Zhan's disappearance, Chinese government spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he did not have any specific information but that \"China is a country ruled by law, and the legal rights of all individuals are protected by law.\"\nBut activists and human rights organizations are not convinced. They say that the disappearance of activists is just the latest example of China's crackdown on basic human rights, including freedom of speech and assembly.\nSophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, said that the disappearances are \"just one more way that the Chinese government is undermining human rights and the rule of law. It's clearly a tactic to silence activists and terrify others into not speaking out.\"\nRichardson called on the international community to speak out against China's human rights abuses and to pressure the Chinese government to release the activists who have disappeared.\nBut so far, the international response has been limited. China is a powerful country with a lot of influence on the world stage, and many countries are hesitant to criticize it too harshly. But as the disappearances continue, it may become harder for the international community to turn a blind eye to China's human rights abuses.\nFor now, the families and supporters of the disappeared activists are left to wonder about their loved ones' fates. For them, the crackdown on pro-democracy activists is not just a political issue \u2013 it's a deeply personal one.", "Despite worsening diplomatic relations between China and Taiwan, Chinese officials attended a reception organized by Ukraine\u2019s embassy in Beijing on Monday evening. The event was held to mark Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day and was attended by prominent diplomats, businessmen, and foreign journalists.\nThe event was attended by Chinese officials despite China\u2019s ongoing diplomatic spat with Taiwan. Tensions between the two have been escalating in recent months, with China ramping up its military and economic pressure on Taiwan.\nDespite the diplomatic tensions with Taiwan, the Chinese delegation was warmly welcomed by Ukrainian Ambassador to China Sergiy Korsunsky and embassy staff. In a speech at the event, Ambassador Korsunsky praised the growing relationship between China and Ukraine, stating that the two countries have strengthened their ties in recent years with increased trade, investment and cultural exchange.\nChina, Ukraine\u2019s largest trading partner, has been investing heavily in Ukraine in recent years, particularly in the areas of agriculture, energy, and infrastructure. Last month, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Infrastructure, Vladyslav Krykliy, visited China to promote closer ties between the two countries in these areas.\nThe attendance of Chinese officials at the Ukraine embassy reception comes just days after Taiwan was expelled from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) by the United Nations. China was quick to claim responsibility for the move, arguing that Taiwan was not a sovereign state and that it had no right to be a member of the international body.\nThe move has further strained Taiwan\u2019s relations with China, which has been increasing pressure on the island nation to accept its \u201cOne China\u201d policy. Taiwan has been pushing back against this policy, promoting its own independent identity and seeking greater diplomatic recognition from other countries.\nDespite the tensions between China and Taiwan, however, Ukraine has shown that it remains committed to maintaining strong diplomatic ties with both countries. While China\u2019s relationship with Taiwan may be strained, its relationship with Ukraine is continuing to grow, and could prove to be a valuable ally for the country in the future. With continuing diplomatic rifts around the world, it is important that countries like Ukraine continue to prioritize diplomacy and peaceful relations with the nations around them.", "London-based pharmaceutical company SkyePharma has predicted that 1998 will be a \u201cmagic year\u201d of growth for its investors and shareholders, thanks to a number of upcoming product launches and partnerships.\nSkyePharma has a strong track record of developing and commercializing innovative drug delivery technologies, including inhalation and oral formulations.

But now, after a period of restructuring and a bold move to flat-rate pricing for its services, AOL is seeing renewed momentum and major new sources of revenue.\nThe restructuring began in 2015 when AOL was acquired by Verizon, the telecommunications giant. The acquisition was part of Verizon's strategy to expand its media and advertising businesses. Since then, AOL has been steadily streamlining its operations and focusing on key areas of growth.\nOne of those areas is advertising. AOL has long been a major player in the digital advertising industry, but it has struggled to keep up with the likes of Google and Facebook. However, with the restructuring, AOL has been able to refocus its efforts on developing innovative advertising solutions that are more effective and streamlined.\nOne of the new sources of revenue that AOL has tapped into is programmatic advertising. This is a type of advertising that uses algorithms to automatically buy and place advertisements. It allows advertisers to target specific audiences more effectively and can be more cost-efficient than traditional advertising methods.\nAOL has also been investing heavily in video advertising. According to eMarketer, digital video advertising is one of the fastest-growing segments of the advertising industry, and AOL has been able to capitalize on this trend. The company has developed a number of video advertising solutions that allow advertisers to create engaging, high-quality video ads that capture the attention of consumers.\nBut the biggest change that AOL has made is the introduction of flat-rate pricing for its services. In the past, AOL charged users a monthly fee for access to its internet services, but now it is offering a flat rate of $4.99 per month for all of its services. This includes unlimited internet access, email, and other features.\nThe move to flat-rate pricing has been a game-changer for AOL. It has allowed the company to attract a new audience of price-sensitive consumers who may have been hesitant to pay the previous monthly fee. It has also simplified the pricing structure, making it easier for customers to understand what they are paying for and how much it will cost them.\nAOL's new pricing model has also helped the company to retain its existing customer base. Many users have been with AOL for years and have a strong attachment to the brand. By offering a flat rate, AOL has been able to keep these users loyal to the company.\nThe flat-rate pricing model has also opened up new revenue streams for AOL. With a larger user base, the company can now offer more targeted advertising opportunities to its advertisers. This has allowed AOL to increase its advertising rates and generate more revenue from its advertising business.\nAOL's renewed momentum has not gone unnoticed by the industry. In 2018, the company was named the \"Programmatic Company of the Year\" by the Drum Digital Advertising Awards. The award recognized AOL's innovative advertising solutions and its commitment to improving the digital advertising industry.\nSo what's next for AOL? The company is continuing to invest in new technologies and solutions that will help it to stay ahead of the curve in the digital world. It is also looking to expand its international footprint, with a focus on key markets such as Europe and Asia.\nOverall, AOL's restructuring and flat-rate pricing strategy have been a huge success for the company. By focusing on key areas of growth and simplifying its pricing model, AOL has been able to attract new customers, retain its existing customer base, and generate new sources of revenue. It's clear that AOL's renewed momentum is here to stay.", "British-American Tobacco (BAT) Industries is facing mounting pressure on its ongoing litigation in the United States as scientific evidence continues to pile up on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The global tobacco giant is expected to face tough questions in the coming weeks as its case moves forward in Federal court in New Jersey.\nThe lawsuit, brought forward by former smoker Barbara McLeod, accuses BAT of manipulating the design and composition of its cigarettes to increase their addictive potential and cause cancer. The company denies the claims and argues that it has always been transparent about the health risks associated with smoking. \nHowever, recent scientific findings have challenged the tobacco industry\u2019s long-standing defense that individuals have a choice to smoke or not. Medical studies have shown that nicotine is highly addictive, making it difficult for people to quit smoking even if they are aware of the risks.\nMoreover, new research has revealed the existence of hidden chemicals in cigarettes that are more harmful than previously believed. These chemicals include nitrosamines, which can cause DNA damage and play a role in the development of cancer.\nThe mounting evidence against the tobacco industry has forced companies such as BAT to rethink their business strategies. In recent years, the company has diversified its portfolio to include e-cigarettes and other nicotine products, which it claims are safer than traditional cigarettes. However, critics argue that these products still contain harmful chemicals and are not a safe alternative.\nMeanwhile, BAT is under pressure from shareholders to address the growing legal risks associated with smoking. In a recent statement, the company said it was committed to \u201cresponsible tobacco marketing, product innovation and harm reduction,\u201d but did not provide any specific strategies for reducing the risks associated with its products.\nDespite the mounting lawsuits, the global tobacco industry continues to generate significant profits. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US National Cancer Institute, tobacco use causes more than 8 million deaths each year worldwide and costs the global economy more than $1 trillion in healthcare expenses and lost productivity.\nThe report warns that unless urgent action is taken to reduce tobacco consumption, the number of deaths will continue to rise, with developing countries particularly vulnerable. \u201cTobacco use is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, and it\u2019s entirely preventable,\u201d said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.\nBAT\u2019s ongoing litigation in the United States highlights the growing scrutiny of the global tobacco industry and the need for more responsible business practices. As companies such as BAT continue to face legal challenges, they will need to adapt to changing consumer attitudes and invest in alternative products that are safer for their customers.\nThe case also highlights the need for stronger regulations to control the tobacco industry and protect public health. Governments around the world have a responsibility to take action to reduce tobacco consumption and support smokers in quitting. These actions can include increasing taxes on tobacco products, implementing smoke-free laws, and providing access to quit-smoking services.\nIn conclusion, BAT\u2019s ongoing legal battle in the United States reflects the growing evidence on the health risks associated with smoking and the need for more responsible business practices in the tobacco industry. As the case moves forward, it is crucial that the industry takes responsibility for the harm caused by its products and works towards reducing the risks associated with tobacco use. Governments must also take urgent action to implement stronger tobacco control measures and protect public health.", "Chile and China have strengthened their bilateral ties with an agreement to boost copper trade and technical support. The agreement was signed during a virtual meeting of the Chile-China Joint Commission of Free Trade Agreement (FTA) on May 12, 2021.\nThe FTA was signed between Chile and China in 2005, and since then, their trade relationship has grown significantly. China is Chile's largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 35% of Chile's total exports in 2020, mainly copper, fruits, wine, and seafood.\nUnder the new agreement, Chile and China will work together to promote trade in copper, which is Chile's primary export to China. Copper accounts for more than half of Chile's exports to China and is crucial for China's manufacturing sector.\nThe agreement also aims to strengthen cooperation in other areas, such as technical support, innovation, e-commerce, and services, as well as to promote investment in priority sectors for both countries.\nDuring the virtual meeting, Chile's Foreign Minister, Andr\u00e9s Allamand, emphasized the importance of the FTA in boosting trade between Chile and China and highlighted the need to diversify the trade relationship beyond copper.\n\"We are interested in exploring other areas of cooperation and making progress in the digital economy, innovation, e-commerce, and services, among others,\" Allamand said.\nChina's Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, expressed his commitment to further deepen the bilateral relationship. \"China is willing to work with Chile to promote the implementation of the FTA, expand cooperation in trade and investment, and jointly explore third-party markets,\" Wang said.\nThe FTA has provided a stable and predictable framework for trade between Chile and China and has allowed both countries to benefit from their complementary economies. In recent years, Chile has also become an important gateway for Chinese companies to access the markets of Latin America and the Caribbean.\nIn addition to trade, China has also provided technical support to Chile in areas such as agriculture, renewable energy, and telecommunications. China and Chile have also signed agreements on cultural exchange, education, and tourism.\nThe strengthening of the Chile-China relationship comes at a time when both countries are facing challenges in their international relations. China is facing increasing criticism from Western countries over human rights violations and its role in the global economy. Chile, on the other hand, is facing domestic unrest over socio-economic issues and has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite these challenges, both countries have expressed their commitment to continuing their cooperation and strengthening their relationship. The new agreement on copper and technical support is an important step towards achieving these goals.", "China's Sinochem Group, one of China's biggest chemical firms, has announced that it has chosen Singapore for the listing of its laboratories division. The move came as a surprise to many market analysts, as Sinochem had previously been considering a listing in Hong Kong or Shanghai.\nAccording to sources close to the matter, the decision to list in Singapore was largely influenced by the strong political ties between China and Singapore. The two countries have enjoyed a close economic and diplomatic relationship for many years, with Singapore being one of China's biggest investors and a key platform for Chinese firms looking to expand their global reach.\nIn addition to the political considerations, Singapore was also seen as an attractive listing destination due to its transparent regulatory environment and strong reputation for corporate governance. Sinochem is likely to benefit from the country's well-established legal framework, which provides investors with a high degree of protection and ensures a level playing field for all market participants.\nThe listing is expected to raise between $1 and $2 billion, making it one of the biggest initial public offerings (IPOs) in the region this year. Sinochem's laboratories division is one of the group's most profitable businesses, with revenues of around $4 billion in 2019. The division focuses on the research and development of chemicals and advanced materials, and has a strong track record of innovation and commercial success.\nThe listing is also expected to provide a significant boost to Singapore's stock exchange, which has been struggling to attract new listings in recent years. Singapore has traditionally been seen as a secondary market to larger exchanges such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but the listing of Sinochem could help to cement its status as a major financial hub in the region.\nHowever, the move has also raised concerns about the potential impact on Hong Kong's status as a financial centre. Hong Kong has traditionally been a popular destination for Chinese companies looking to raise capital, but has recently been facing increased political pressure from Beijing. The ongoing protests and civil unrest in the city have also raised concerns about the potential risks of listing in Hong Kong.\nSome analysts have argued that the Sinochem listing could be seen as a further sign of China's growing confidence in Singapore as a financial centre, and a shift away from Hong Kong. However, others have pointed out that the decision to list in Singapore is likely to be based more on commercial considerations than political factors, and that Hong Kong will continue to play an important role in the region's financial ecosystem.\nRegardless of the motivations behind the decision to list in Singapore, the move is likely to have a significant impact on the region's financial landscape. With the ongoing tensions between the US and China, and the increasing importance of the Asia-Pacific region in the global economy, the choice of listing destination is likely to become an increasingly strategic decision for companies looking to raise capital and expand their global footprint.\nFor Sinochem, the listing in Singapore represents a major milestone in its ongoing expansion plans. The company has been looking to diversify its business portfolio and expand its global reach in recent years, and the laboratories division has been a key focus of these efforts. The listing will provide the division with the capital and resources it needs to continue its research and development activities, and to expand into new markets and geographies.\nOverall, the decision to list in Singapore is a clear indication of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region in the global economy, and of the ongoing shifts in the balance of power between different financial centres and markets. For Sinochem, it represents an opportunity to tap into new sources of capital and achieve greater global visibility and recognition. For Singapore, it is a testament to its growing reputation as a transparent and trustworthy financial hub with strong political and economic ties to China.", "China Vows to Conclude Probe of Disgraced Former Beijing Party Chief\nBeijing, China \u2013 The Communist Party of China (CPC) has pledged to conclude its investigation into Guo Jinlong, a former party chief of Beijing who was removed from his post in 2017 amid allegations of corruption.\nAccording to state-run media, the CPC's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) announced on Tuesday that it had wrapped up its probe of Guo and would hand the case over to judicial authorities for further investigation and potential prosecution.\nThe news comes as part of the CPC's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which has aimed to root out graft and misconduct among party officials at all levels.\nGuo, who served as party chief of Beijing from 2012 until his removal in 2017, has been under investigation for several years over allegations of corruption and abuse of power.\nAt the time of his removal, Guo was accused of being linked to the disgraced former security chief Zhou Yongkang, who was subsequently sentenced to life in prison for corruption and other offenses.\nWhile Guo has not been formally charged with any crimes, he has been subject to a range of disciplinary measures, including suspension from his position as a member of the National People's Congress.\nDespite his troubles, Guo has maintained his innocence and insisted that he has not engaged in any illegal activities.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the CCDI said that its investigation had uncovered \"serious violations of discipline and law\" by Guo.\n\"Guo Jinlong has committed a series of violations of political discipline, organizational discipline, and anti-corruption laws,\" the CCDI said. \"His actions have seriously harmed the interests of the party and the state.\"\nThe CCDI did not provide specific details of the allegations against Guo, but said that it had found evidence of \"improper personal conduct\" and \"abuse of power.\"\nThe announcement of the investigation's completion comes amid a broader crackdown on corruption in China, which has seen hundreds of officials at all levels of government and party expelled or punished for wrongdoing.\nThe campaign, which has been led by President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, has been described by analysts as the most sweeping effort to root out corruption in China's modern history.\nCritics, however, have accused the campaign of being politically motivated and lacking transparency, with some observers suggesting that it has been used as a tool to eliminate potential rivals of Xi.\nThe CCDI's announcement did not specify what legal action, if any, would be taken against Guo following the conclusion of the investigation.\nUnder Chinese law, the maximum penalty for corruption is the death penalty, although this is reserved for the most serious cases and is rarely used.\nMore commonly, officials found guilty of corruption are sentenced to lengthy prison terms and are often stripped of their assets and positions.\nThe investigation into Guo is seen as an important test of the CPC's commitment to its anti-corruption campaign, which has been touted as a key pillar of the party's efforts to maintain its grip on power.\nThe party has said that it will continue to pursue corrupt officials \"without mercy or leniency\" in order to maintain its credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese public.\nIt remains to be seen what will become of Guo, but his case is likely to be closely watched by both China's political elite and the international community.", "The telecommunications industry is set for a shake-up as MCI Communications Corp. announces its 10-year partnership with NextWave Telecom Inc.

Despite the positive earnings, the company raised concerns about its Q4 outlook, which led to volatility in its stock prices.\nThe company\u2019s Q3 revenue of $17.6 billion marked a modest 1% increase from the same period last year, due to the growth of its cloud, software, and services divisions. The cloud and cognitive software segment grew 7% to $5.6 billion, while the business services segment increased by 2%, reaching $4.1 billion.\nIBM\u2019s cloud services experienced a significant growth in Q3, with Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue increasing by 7% to $5.6 billion. The company\u2019s hybrid cloud offerings, which enable clients to manage data across multiple cloud platforms, reported 10% growth. With remote work becoming the new norm, businesses have increasingly relied on cloud services to maintain operations.\nMoreover, IBM has been leveraging its AI capabilities to support its clients' requirements, ranging from supply chain management to finance and HR services. The company's AI services have resulted in significant revenue increases, with AI software revenue increasing by 8%.\nIBM also made headlines in October when it announced its spinoff of its infrastructure business into a separate publicly-traded company, with the goal of focusing more on cloud and AI services. IBM CEO, Arvind Krishna, said that the decision enables the company to \u201cbuild a more focused company ready to embrace the opportunities of the hybrid cloud world.\u201d\nWhile investors welcomed the Q3 results, the company's forecast for Q4 raised concerns. IBM stated that Q4 earnings would continue to be impacted by the global pandemic and ongoing economic challenges. Specifically, the company stated that there may be significant declines in some of its core businesses, including consulting and application management services.\nThe announcement caused IBM's share prices to fluctuate. The shares initially increased by 5% following the earnings release, but then decreased by 3% when the company disclosed its Q4 outlook.\nAnalysts noted that the pandemic continues to impact IBM's earnings, especially as businesses reassess their priorities and spending plans amid ongoing lockdowns and restrictions. Demand for IBM's consulting and application management services is expected to be impacted this quarter due to the ongoing disruptions.\nFurthermore, IBM's core business of mainframe servers is expected to face a decline in Q4 due to the ongoing shift towards cloud computing. IBM's mainframe business has traditionally comprised a significant portion of its revenue stream, but the trend of mainframe customers transitioning to cloud-based solutions has been a growing concern for the company.\nDespite these concerns, IBM remains optimistic about its future potential. The company has been investing heavily in cloud and AI services, and plans to spin-off its infrastructure business to focus on these growth areas. These initiatives are expected to position IBM for long-term success, despite the short-term challenges.\nIn conclusion, IBM's Q3 performance was strong, but the company's outlook for Q4 is uncertain due to the ongoing pandemic and changing business priorities. Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the company's future, as IBM continues to focus on its cloud and AI services offerings. The fluctuation of IBM's shares in response to the Q4 outlook serves as a reminder of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the technology sector and the broader economy. Investors will continue to observe IBM's performance closely as the pandemic continues to evolve.", "U-Freight Holdings, a leading international freight forwarding and logistics company, is planning to establish a new office in Guangzhou, China, to take advantage of China Southern Airlines' expanding network.\nAccording to sources, the new office would be strategically located near the Baiyun International Airport, which is China Southern's hub in Guangzhou, to provide better access to the carrier's domestic and international routes.\nWith China Southern's strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region and its growing route network, U-Freight Holdings is looking to expand its business in the region.\n\"We see tremendous opportunities in the market, especially with China Southern's expanding network and our expertise in freight forwarding and logistics.

The fate of Carter-Wallace now rests with the company's board of directors and shareholders.", "As China continues to propel its economy forward, its foreign debt has been steadily rising. However, financial analysts maintain that this is not a cause for concern.\nChina's foreign debt has been on the rise in recent years, reaching over $2 trillion in 2021. This increase in foreign debt has been driven by China's massive infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative, which requires large amounts of financing from foreign entities. Additionally, the pandemic has forced China to increase its borrowing to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis.\nDespite the surge in China's foreign debt, financial analysts argue that it is not a cause for concern. For one, China still has a strong balance of payment surplus, which insulates it from external shocks. Furthermore, China's foreign debt-to-GDP ratio is only around 14%, which is significantly lower than other emerging economies.\nOn top of this, China has a massive foreign exchange reserve of over $3.2 trillion, which can support the repayment of its debt obligations. In fact, China has already begun to reduce its reliance on foreign borrowing by issuing more domestic debt.\nIn addition to these supportive factors, China has been implementing measures to manage its foreign debt risks. For instance, the government has imposed stricter controls on capital outflows to prevent excessive foreign borrowing. Furthermore, China has been diversifying its funding sources by tapping into new markets, such as the green bond market, which is dedicated to financing environmentally sustainable projects.\nAnalysts also point out that China's foreign debt is different from that of many other countries, as the majority of it is denominated in its local currency, the yuan. This reduces the risk of a sudden devaluation of the currency that would make it harder for China to service its foreign debt.\nOverall, experts agree that China's rising foreign debt is not a cause for concern, as the country has strong buffers and is taking measures to manage the risks. However, continued monitoring and sound macroeconomic management will be crucial to avoid excessive foreign borrowing and maintain financial stability.\nIn conclusion, China's booming economy has led to a significant increase in foreign debt, but financial analysts maintain that the country has sufficient buffers to manage the risks. While China may continue to rely on foreign borrowing for some time, its efforts to manage the risks and diversify its funding sources bode well for its future financial stability.", "Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists are mobilizing to fight against a California ballot measure that could threaten American capitalism.\nProposition 21, which will be voted on in November, seeks to expand rent control in California by repealing the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. The act limits rent control to buildings built before 1995, exempts single-family homes and condos, and allows landlords to set rents at market rates once a tenant moves out.\nHowever, Proposition 21 would allow rent control on all housing units that are more than 15 years old and would allow for rent control on single-family homes and condos once they are sold or rented out. This could hurt landlords and potentially discourage investment in new building construction.\nThe ballot measure has garnered support from tenants\u2019 rights groups, who believe that it will help provide affordable housing for low-income residents. Some political leaders in California, including Senator Bernie Sanders, have also endorsed the proposition.\nHowever, Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists argue that Proposition 21 could stifle innovation and hurt California\u2019s economy. They believe that it could discourage investment in new housing developments, which could further exacerbate the housing crisis in California.\n\u201cWe are very concerned about the potential negative impacts of Proposition 21 on California\u2019s housing market and the entrepreneurial workforce and businesses that rely on it,\u201d said Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, a business advocacy group.\nThe tech industry in California has been a driving force behind the state\u2019s economic growth in recent years. However, its success has also contributed to the state\u2019s housing crisis, as demand for housing has outpaced supply.\nCalifornia currently has one of the highest rates of homelessness in the country, with an estimated 151,000 homeless people as of 2019. The state also has some of the highest housing costs in the country, with median home prices reaching $626,000 in August 2020, according to the California Association of Realtors.\nOpponents of Proposition 21 argue that rent control is not the solution to the housing crisis, and that it could actually make it worse by discouraging investment in new housing development.\n\u201cRent control is a failed policy that only makes the housing crisis worse,\u201d said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and a supporter of Proposition 21.\nHowever, proponents of the ballot measure argue that rent control is necessary to address the growing housing affordability crisis in California.\n\u201cWe are fighting to ensure that working families can afford to keep a roof over their heads,\u201d said Tony Sammartano, campaign manager for the Yes on 21 campaign.\nThe battle over Proposition 21 has become a major issue in California\u2019s political landscape, with both sides spending millions of dollars on advertising and canvassing efforts.\nThe Yes on 21 campaign has received significant financial support from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has donated over $22 million to the campaign, according to the California Secretary of State\u2019s office.\nMeanwhile, the No on 21 campaign has received significant support from the real estate industry and individual landlords, who believe that rent control could hurt their bottom line.\nBoth sides have also enlisted high-profile endorsers to sway voters. Senator Sanders has endorsed Proposition 21, while former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich has endorsed the No on 21 campaign.\nThe outcome of the vote on Proposition 21 could have far-reaching implications for California\u2019s housing market and its economy. If the proposition passes, it could set a precedent for other states and cities to enact similar rent control measures, which could discourage investment in the housing market.\nHowever, if the proposition fails, it could be seen as a victory for capitalism and a sign that renters\u2019 rights are not necessarily the solution to the housing affordability crisis.\nFor now, Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists are continuing to fight against the measure, arguing that it could harm the tech industry and hinder economic growth in California.\n\u201cWe are going to fight this tooth and nail,\u201d said Carl Guardino, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \u201cWe believe that rent control will only make the housing crisis worse.\u201d", "Nestled in the heart of Tibet's bustling industrial city of Lhasa, the once-outdated leather factory, Aria Leather, is now a success story that is being celebrated globally, thanks to a German investment firm\u2019s efforts to make the factory more environmentally friendly.\nEstablished in 1995, Aria Leather was known for its high-quality leather products and was one of the largest employers in the city. However, the factory fell behind in using modern machinery, and its use of outdated technology had a negative impact on the environment. The factory's production processes polluted the environment and exposed workers to hazardous substances.\nHowever, the situation changed a few years ago when the German investment firm, Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG), came forward to invest in the factory. The company collaborated with the factory's management to renovate the entire production line and install new equipment and machinery. With DEG's investment, the factory transformed from an outdated manufacturing facility to a modern, automated and environmentally friendly operation, resulting in a significant reduction in waste and energy consumption.\nThe factory now implements cutting-edge equipment and technology to minimize its environmental footprint. One of the most notable eco-friendly changes in the factory's operations is the installation of solar panels on the roof, which provides renewable energy. This solar project has reduced the factory's carbon footprint by more than 300 tonnes annually, demonstrating the transformative power of investments in renewable energy.\nAnother significant transformation in the factory is its waste management system, where DEG helped implement measures to ensure that the factory's waste materials are properly sorted, treated and disposed of. By treating and recycling waste products, including wastewater, the factory has decreased the amount of waste sent to the landfill while saving on energy, water and recycling costs.\nIn addition to environmental benefits, the upgraded factory provides safer working conditions for employees, with improved ventilation and air conditioning systems and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves and other protective gear during production.\nThe factory's workers have also benefited from the renovation of the facility, with their wages now increased to match industry standards. Moreover, the factory has made room for advancement opportunities and invested in their workforce by providing new training programs and opportunities to learn new skills that have allowed them to grow their career opportunities.\nDEG's investment in Aria Leather has resulted in a positive outcome for all stakeholders, as the upgraded facility has seamlessly integrated technological advancements with traditional production methods.\nThe factory has drawn the attention of multinational fashion and leather firms, including some of the world's largest brands, who now source their leather products from Aria Leather. The factory's unique environmental drive has helped attract eco-conscious customers, too, who value high-quality leather products produced from sustainable sources.\nAria Leather's partnership with DEG has created a model for environmentally friendly industrial practices that other companies around the world can emulate. Many experts believe that similar investments that consider environmental sustainability in various industries can lead to economic growth and development.\nThe factory's success story speaks volumes about the potential for creating environmentally friendly economic growth, with a positive impact on future generations. The success story is an example of how investments in sustainable environmental practices not only benefit our environment but also have a positive long-term impact on businesses, workers, and the community.\nIn conclusion, the German investment company, DEG, has shown that it is possible to combine traditional manufacturing methods with modern technology and environmentally friendly practices to transform a struggling factory into a successful venture. The investment in Aria Leather has not only significantly reduced the factory's environmental footprint but has also created secure employment opportunities, safer working conditions, and higher industry standards for worker salaries. Overall, the success of Aria Leather can inspire many other companies to take similar steps in safely propelling themselves forward in achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).", "Igor Sechin, the former Russian energy minister and the CEO of Rosneft, has failed in his attempt to create a mega oil corporation. The proposed corporation was set to combine the resources of Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, and three other major Russian oil companies. The plan fell apart, however, after Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) rejected the proposal on the grounds that it would create a monopoly.\nThe proposed mega oil corporation was supposed to be the largest of its kind in the world, with a combined market capitalization of over $400 billion. Sechin, who has been pushing for the creation of such a corporation for years, saw it as the key to Russia's global energy dominance. The move also followed a similar trend in the energy sector globally, where mergers and acquisitions have had a significant impact on the market.\nSechin argued that the merger would be beneficial for the industry, the economy, and the country as a whole. He claimed that by consolidating the resources of the five largest oil companies in Russia, the new corporation could increase efficiency, improve profitability, and compete more effectively with global rivals such as ExxonMobil and BP.\nHowever, the FAS was not convinced. The regulatory body rejected the proposal, stating that the merger would give the new corporation too much market power and would stifle competition in the industry. The FAS also expressed concern that the merger would lead to job losses and a reduction in the number of players in the market.\nThe decision by the FAS was a blow to Sechin, who has been a prominent figure in the Russian energy sector for more than two decades. He has been instrumental in Russia's efforts to expand its presence in the global energy market and has been a key figure in the country's recent push to increase oil production. Sechin has also been a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, who reportedly backed the proposed merger.\nDespite the setback, Sechin has not given up on his vision for a mega oil corporation in Russia. He has stated that he will continue to explore other options for merging the country's largest oil companies, and that he remains committed to achieving his goal of creating a global energy powerhouse.\nThe rejection of the proposed merger highlights the challenges that Russia faces in its efforts to expand its energy sector. Although the country has some of the largest oil and gas reserves in the world, it has been struggling to attract foreign investment and has been facing increasing competition from other countries such as the United States and Saudi Arabia.\nThe government has been trying to address these challenges by implementing a series of reforms aimed at improving the regulatory environment, attracting foreign investment, and boosting production. The proposed merger was seen as a key part of this strategy, but the rejection by the FAS has cast doubt on its effectiveness.\nThe failure of the proposed mega oil corporation also underscores the challenges that Russian companies face in the global energy market. Although Rosneft and other Russian firms have been able to expand their international presence in recent years, they still face significant obstacles such as sanctions, political risks, and competition from other countries.\nDespite these challenges, Russia remains a major player in the global energy market. The country has been working to diversify its energy sector by expanding into areas such as renewable energy, natural gas, and nuclear power. It has also been investing heavily in infrastructure and technology to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\nIn conclusion, the failure of the proposed mega oil corporation led by Igor Sechin, the former Russian energy minister and CEO of Rosneft, underscores the challenges that Russia faces in its efforts to expand its energy sector and compete globally. Although the rejection of the proposed merger by the FAS was a setback for Sechin and the country, Russia remains a major player in the global energy market and has been taking steps to diversify its energy sector and improve its competitiveness.", "The United States Justice Department\u2019s website was hacked earlier this week, causing significant concern within cyber security circles and beyond. Details of the intrusion are still emerging, but initial reports indicate a sophisticated and coordinated attack that exploited vulnerabilities within the department\u2019s online infrastructure. The incident shines a harsh light on the vulnerability of many governmental websites to cyber attacks, and highlights the need for ongoing vigilance in the fight against cybercrime.\nThe Department of Justice initially acknowledged the breach in a statement released on Tuesday. The statement explained that the department\u2019s website, which serves as a gateway to many of its online resources, had been targeted by hackers with unknown motives and origins. The statement went on to say that the department was working with federal authorities including the FBI to determine the extent of the intrusion, and to secure any sensitive information that may have been exposed as a result.\nThe hackers who infiltrated the Justice Department\u2019s website are believed to have used a combination of techniques to gain unauthorized access. These techniques may have included exploiting vulnerabilities in the website\u2019s software or manipulating user credentials to bypass authentication protocols. Regardless of the exact methods used, the fact that a high-profile federal agency like the Department of Justice can be compromised in this way underscores the need for all organizations \u2013 both public and private \u2013 to prioritize cyber security as a top concern.\nIn the wake of the breach, many experts are calling for increased investments in cyber security infrastructure and training. These experts argue that the risks of cyber attacks \u2013 which can range from data breaches to ransomware attacks and beyond \u2013 are only going to grow as technology becomes more integrated into people\u2019s lives. Therefore, it is essential for organizations to take proactive steps to protect themselves and their users against these kinds of threats.\nThe Department of Justice has vowed to take all necessary steps to remediate the breach, including disabling access to compromised systems and networks and conducting a thorough review of its cyber security protocols. In the meantime, organizations across the United States are taking notice and redoubling their own efforts to protect their digital assets. From large corporations to small businesses and individuals, the message from the Justice Department hack is clear: when it comes to cyber security, vigilance is key.", "Amid mounting pressure to increase funding, the BBC is reportedly in discussions with pay TV groups with regards to a joint venture. The move comes as the UK's public service broadcaster faces mounting pressure on its funding model, with the government insisting that the licence fee model needs to be reviewed. The proposed joint venture would see BBC content made available on pay TV channels such as Sky, Virgin Media, and BT.\nThe news follows rumours of a potential merger between Channel 4 and the BBC, which has been the subject of intense speculation in recent months. According to a source close to the situation, the talks between the BBC and pay TV groups are at an early stage, but both sides are said to be keen to explore the potential benefits of such a partnership.\n\"Increasingly, the BBC is being asked to do more with less. We're facing pressure from all sides \u2013 from the government, from the public, and from the media industry itself,\" said the source. \"A joint venture with pay TV providers could be a way to alleviate some of that pressure, while at the same time increasing the reach and value of BBC content.\"\nThe prospect of a joint venture between the BBC and pay TV providers has divided opinion within the media industry. Some commentators have welcomed the move as a pragmatic response to the challenges facing the broadcasting industry, while others have criticised it as a sell-out of the BBC's public service remit.\n\"There's no doubt that the BBC is facing significant challenges, but a joint venture with pay TV providers is not the answer,\" said one industry analyst. \"The BBC has a unique remit to provide high-quality, public service broadcasting that is free at the point of use. Any move that compromises that remit \u2013 even in the pursuit of increased revenue \u2013 is a dangerous one.\"\nDespite the controversy surrounding the proposal, it is clear that the BBC is under considerable pressure to find new ways of funding its operations. In addition to calls for the licence fee to be re-evaluated, the broadcaster is also facing increased competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.\n\"The traditional broadcasting model is changing, and the BBC needs to adapt to that change if it is to remain relevant and sustainable,\" said the source. \"A joint venture with pay TV providers is just one of a number of options that we are considering.\"\nThe talks between the BBC and pay TV providers come at a time when the government is also under pressure to increase funding for the broadcaster. Last year, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden called for a review of the licence fee model, stating that the current system was \"outdated\".\n\"The licence fee model has served us well for many years, but it is clear that it is no longer fit for purpose,\" said Dowden. \"We need to explore new models of funding that are fairer, more sustainable and better suited to the changing media landscape.\"\nDespite the pressure from the government and the challenges facing the broadcasting industry, there is still widespread support for the BBC's public service remit. A recent survey by the BBC found that 87% of respondents believed that the broadcaster should continue to provide high-quality public service content.\n\"As the UK's public service broadcaster, the BBC has a unique role to play in providing impartial, high-quality news and entertainment to the nation,\" said the source. \"We are committed to fulfilling that role, whatever challenges we may face in the years ahead.\"\nAs discussions between the BBC and pay TV providers continue, it remains to be seen whether a joint venture between the two sides will ultimately materialise. However, one thing is clear \u2013 the broadcaster is under intense pressure to find new ways of funding its operations and maintaining its public service remit in the face of unprecedented challenges.", "Boris Becker, the former German tennis ace, has once again demonstrated his resilience by winning his Wimbledon match yesterday after a recent injury setback. The former world No. 1, who is now the head coach of Novak Djokovic, came back from the injury to beat Martin Mulligan of Australia in straight sets.\nBecker had sustained an injury to his wrist during his training sessions with Djokovic in preparation for Wimbledon. The injury prevented him from playing in the Wimbledon legends tournament, but it did not stop him from coaching Djokovic to his sixth Wimbledon title.\nDespite the injury, Becker remained optimistic and confident of his ability to compete at the highest level. Yesterday's win marks his first competitive match since the unfortunate incident.\nSpeaking to the media after his win, the 53-year-old shared his thoughts on his recent setback. \"Of course, it was tough, but I'm feeling much better now.

Many of them praised his fighting spirit and dedication to the sport.\n\"Becker is an inspiration to all tennis players. He's one of the greatest to ever grace the court, and his determination to keep playing despite his injury is incredible,\" said one fan on Twitter.\nBecker's win also comes as a morale boost for Djokovic, who is currently recovering from his own injury setback. The Serbian tennis star had to withdraw from the mixed doubles match at the Olympics due to a shoulder injury, raising concerns about his fitness ahead of the US Open.\nHowever, with Becker back on the court and steering the ship, Djokovic fans are optimistic that the six-time Wimbledon champion will make a strong comeback soon.\nOverall, Becker's win serves as a reminder that setbacks can be overcome with grit and determination. His resilience has inspired many fans worldwide, and his return to competitive tennis is a testament to his unwavering love for the sport.", "In a significant development in the broadcasting industry, DIRECTV's consortium has won the rights to offer Direct-to-Home (DTH) television services in Chile, beating its rivals. The consortium, which comprises subsidiaries of AT&T, Chilean retailer Falabella, and Chilean investment firm Inversiones Forestal, had applied for the license last year in October.\nAfter a thorough evaluation process, the Chilean Telecommunications and Transportation Ministry has given the green light for DIRECTV to offer DTH television services in the country. The consortium will serve more than 1.2 million households across Chile, expanding DIRECTV's existing reach in the Latin American market.\nThis marks a significant milestone for the company, as DIRECTV had faced tough competition from its rivals, including Movistar and VTR, when it applied for the license.

The transportation sector, which is crucial to the country's economy, was brought to a halt as thousands of truckers blocked major highways and roads to show their dissatisfaction with the government.\nAfter several rounds of negotiations, the government agreed to some of their demands. The main points of the agreement include a reduction of toll costs by 20% and a reduction of fuel prices by 8 cents per gallon. The government also pledged to provide loans to truckers at lower interest rates and facilitated access to financing options to purchase new vehicles.\n\"The government recognizes the importance of the transportation sector and the vital role it plays in the country's development. We will continue to work alongside the truckers to ensure their demands are met,\" said Colombian President, Ivan Duque in a statement.\nThe National Association of Land Transporters (ANT) welcomed the partial deal and announced the suspension of the strike. \"We are pleased with these achievements, but we will remain vigilant to ensure the government fulfills its commitments,\" said ANT President, Pedro Aguilar.\nThe strike had caused significant economic losses, as goods were left stranded at ports, and agricultural products were unable to reach markets. The National Association of Agriculture (ANA) estimated losses to the sector at over $300 million.\nThe strike also had implications on the country's energy supply, as there were reports of fuel shortages in some areas. Colombia imports around 70% of its gasoline and diesel, and the truckers' strike had disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages.\nThe common citizen was also affected by the strike, as public transport services were limited, and the cost of goods and services increased due to supply chain disruption.\nThe Colombian government had urged truckers to end the strike, citing its negative impact on the economy and the ordinary citizens. The government had also promised to address the truckers' demands and called for negotiations.\nThe partial deal has brought relief to truckers and the transportation sector. However, some truckers' demands remained unaddressed, such as a revision of freight rates and an increase in subsidies for vehicle maintenance.\nThe truckers had also demanded that the government address the issue of insecurity on highways, as there had been several incidents of attacks on truckers by criminal gangs. The government has pledged to improve security measures on highways and provide security escorts to trucks carrying valuable cargo.\nThe strike had received support from other unions and civil society organizations, who called on the government to address the truckers' demands. The protests had also led to clashes with security forces, leading to injuries and arrests.\nThe government had condemned the violence and called for peaceful protests, but the situation had escalated in some areas. Human rights organizations had called on both sides to exercise restraint and respect citizens' rights to move freely.\nThe end of the strike has brought relief to the citizens and businesses that were affected by it. The transportation sector now faces the task of recovering from the economic losses incurred during the strike and rebuilding supply chains.\nHowever, the truckers' remaining demands will remain a challenge for the government as they seek to address them while maintaining a stable economy. The partial deal marks a step forward, but the journey towards a sustainable transportation sector remains long.", "Beijing, China- The East China Sea dispute between China and Japan escalated on Friday, with China accusing Japan of \"irresponsible actions\" and \"risking regional peace and stability\".\nThe dispute centers around a group of uninhabited islands known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. The islands are located in the East China Sea and are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and potential oil and gas reserves.\nIn recent years, both China and Japan have claimed sovereignty over the islands, leading to tensions in the region. The dispute has sparked protests and even threats of military conflict between the two countries.\nThe latest accusations from China come after Japan announced plans to build a new missile defense system on the islands. China has described the move as a \"clear provocation\" and has warned Japan to stop its \"aggressive actions\" in the region.\n\"Japan's construction of the missile defense system on the islands is a clear provocation and a serious violation of China's territorial integrity,\" said Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry.\n\"China has the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he added.\nJapan's defense minister, Taro Kono, has defended the move, stating that the missile defense system is necessary to protect Japanese territory from potential threats.\n\"We are building this missile defense system to protect our country from the threat of ballistic missiles,\" he said. \"It is a necessary measure to ensure the security of our nation.\"\nThe dispute between China and Japan over the East China Sea islands has been ongoing for decades, but tensions have escalated in recent years. In 2012, Japan purchased three of the islands from a private owner, leading to widespread protests in China.\nChina has also accused Japan of violating its airspace and territorial waters in the region, leading to multiple incidents between the two countries' militaries.\nThe United States has called on both China and Japan to find a peaceful solution to the dispute, but tensions remain high in the region.\nIn response to Japan's announcement about the missile defense system, China has increased its military presence in the region and conducted military exercises near the islands.\n\"The Chinese military will take all necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" said Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense. \"We call on Japan to stop its provocative actions and take concrete steps to maintain regional peace and stability.\"\nThe East China Sea dispute is just one of several territorial disputes between China and its neighboring countries in the region. China has also been involved in an ongoing dispute with Taiwan over its sovereignty and with Vietnam and other countries over competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.\nInternational observers have expressed concerns about China's aggressive posture in the region and its disregard for international law and norms.\n\"As China continues to assert its claims to disputed territories in the region, tensions are likely to persist,\" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"If China continues to act unilaterally and disregard international norms, it will only undermine its own legitimacy and isolate itself from the international community.\"\nAs tensions continue to rise in the region, the international community is closely watching to see how China and Japan will handle the dispute over the East China Sea islands. Many are calling for a peaceful solution to the conflict, but the risk of military escalation remains a real concern.", "Beijing, China - China has sent positive signals to investors in the country's stock and bond markets. Authorities have been taking steps to boost market liquidity and support investor confidence amidst concerns about the economic slowdown and the ongoing trade war with the United States.\nOne of the significant measures taken by the government is the recent cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which frees up billions of yuan for lending. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced on September 6 that it would reduce the RRR by 50 basis points, the third such move this year, which would inject around 900 billion yuan ($126 billion) into the banking system. This measure is expected to lower borrowing costs and help businesses secure financing, which would stimulate investment and consumption, and ultimately boost economic growth.\nThe RRR cut is a part of the government's broader efforts to stabilize economic growth. Despite the US-China trade tensions, China's economy has been holding up reasonably well, expanding 6.2% in the second quarter. However, many economists expect growth to slow down further in the coming months, as the trade war drags on. The government's latest stimulus package appears to be aimed at preventing a significant slowdown in the economy and maintaining social stability.\nThe RRR cut has also had a positive impact on the country's stock and bond markets. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index surged nearly 1% on September 6, while yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds fell to their lowest level since 2016. This suggests that investors are becoming more optimistic about the prospects of China's domestic economy, despite the headwinds from the trade tensions.\nChina's stock market has been one of the worst-performing in the world this year, with the Shanghai Composite Index down more than 15%. The market has been hit by a combination of factors, including the trade war, a slowdown in economic growth, and concerns about corporate debt and non-performing loans in the banking sector. However, some analysts believe that the worst may be over for Chinese stocks and that the recent RRR cut could lead to a turnaround in sentiment.\n\"The RRR cut sends a strong signal that the government is determined to support economic growth and maintain stability, which should instill more confidence in the stock market,\" said Wang Weijun, an analyst at Huatai Securities. \"We also expect more policy measures, such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending, to be rolled out in the next few months, which could further boost investor sentiment.\"\nChina's bond market has also been attracting more attention from foreign investors, as the government has been taking steps to open up the market and improve the regulatory framework. The PBOC has been promoting the use of the yuan in global trade and investment, as part of its broader strategy to internationalize the currency and challenge the dominance of the US dollar.\n\"China's bond market offers attractive yields and diversification opportunities for international investors, and we expect more foreign capital to flow in, especially given the uncertainties in other major economies,\" said Zhao Xijun, deputy dean of the School of Finance at Renmin University of China.\nAt the same time, the government has been strengthening its regulatory oversight of the bond market, to prevent risks associated with excessive leverage and defaults. In August, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII) issued new guidelines aimed at improving the credit rating system and ensuring more transparency in the bond market.\n\"The new guidelines are a welcome move towards a more transparent and stable bond market,\" said Zhu Ning, deputy director of the National Institute of Financial Research at Tsinghua University. \"It shows that the government is committed to balancing the promotion of market development with the need to prevent systemic risks.\"\nOverall, China's signal of growth in the stock and bond markets reflects the government's ongoing commitment to reform and openness, despite the challenges posed by the trade war and global economic uncertainties. As China's domestic economy continues to evolve and mature, there will be many opportunities for investors to benefit from the country's long-term growth potential, and the government's efforts to support the financial sector will be crucial in realizing that potential.", "Salomon Brothers, a leading global investment bank, has predicted \"phenomenal\" growth for Thai Airways International (THAI), the flag carrier airline of Thailand. The bank analysts have also recommended that THAI should focus on expanding its cargo business, which has been a key driver of the airline's revenue amid the pandemic.\nAccording to the research note by Salomon Brothers, THAI has the potential to emerge as a leading airline in the region with its strong brand recognition, extensive route network, and efficient cost structure. The analysts expect the airline to benefit from the growing demand for air travel in the Asia Pacific region, driven by the expanding middle class, rising tourism, and improving business sentiment.\nIn addition to the passenger business, the bank analysts see significant opportunities for THAI to further develop its cargo business, which has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging year for the airline industry. With the global logistics industry undergoing a transformational shift towards e-commerce and digitalization, there is a growing demand for fast, reliable, and efficient delivery of goods across borders.\nSalomon Brothers expects that THAI's cargo business will continue to benefit from the strong demand for medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and other essential goods during the pandemic. The bank analysts also highlight the potential for THAI to partner with logistics companies and e-commerce platforms to tap into the growing cross-border trade and online shopping.\n\"The cargo business has been a stronghold for THAI, and we believe that the airline can further leverage this business to enhance its competitiveness and profitability,\" said the lead analyst of Salomon Brothers' research note.\nThe bank analysts' prediction comes as THAI is undergoing a major restructuring process following its filing for bankruptcy protection in May 2020. The airline has been struggling with financial losses, high debts, and management issues in recent years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis. Under the rehabilitation plan approved by the bankruptcy court, THAI aims to reduce its costs, improve its operational efficiency, and restructure its debt.\nThe Salomon Brothers' research note could provide THAI with a much-needed boost in confidence and investor interest. The airline's stock price has been under pressure in the past year, reflecting the challenging operating conditions and the uncertainty surrounding its future. However, if THAI can execute its turnaround plan successfully and capitalize on the growth opportunities in the passenger and cargo markets, it could emerge as a stronger and more resilient airline in the post-pandemic era.", "AT&T Corp has announced a delay in the CEO transition for newly appointed President John Walter. The decision to postpone the transition comes as the company aims to give Walter more time to learn about the business before taking on the CEO role.\nThe announcement was made in a memo to employees from current CEO Randall Stephenson, who said that the delay would allow Walter to continue to work closely with him and other senior executives to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing the company.\nStephenson stated in the memo that Walter had only been with the company for a short time and needed more time to gain a deeper understanding of the business landscape. Walter, who was appointed as President of AT&T in September 2019, has been responsible for the company's strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, and investor relations.\nStephenson added that the delay would also allow Walter to focus on specific areas of the business that require his attention before taking on a wider strategic role. The CEO said that Walter would work on areas such as wireless, entertainment and media, and the company's overall financial performance.\nThe delay in the CEO transition is not expected to have a significant impact on AT&T's business operations, with Stephenson expected to continue in his role as CEO for the foreseeable future. Stephenson, who has led AT&T since 2007, has been credited with transforming the company from a traditional telecoms operator into a diversified media and communications conglomerate.\nWalter's appointment as President was seen as a key step towards the CEO transition, with many expecting him to succeed Stephenson when he stepped down. Walter joined AT&T from RBC Capital Markets, where he served as a Managing Director and Head of Telecom, Media, and Technology Investment Banking.\nIn his previous role, Walter was responsible for overseeing the firm's telecoms, media, and technology investment banking practice, advising clients on mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity financing, and other strategic transactions. He has also worked at Lehman Brothers, where he was a Managing Director in the Investment Banking Division.\nWalter's appointment was seen as a significant move by AT&T to bolster its mergers and acquisitions expertise, as well as its strategic planning and investor relations capabilities. His delay in taking on the CEO role is seen as a reflection of the board's commitment to ensuring a smooth transition of leadership and a continuation of the company's success.\nAT&T has been undergoing a period of significant transformation in recent years, as it seeks to stay ahead of changing consumer demands and the evolution of the media and communications landscape. The company has invested heavily in content creation and distribution, with the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018 representing a significant milestone in this regard.\nDespite these efforts, AT&T has faced challenges in recent months, including mounting debt and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its business operations. The decision to delay the CEO transition is seen as a clear signal that the company is focused on addressing these challenges head-on and ensuring a bright future for the business.", "As the banking industry in Missouri has experienced a wave of consolidation, Mercantile Bancorp Inc has remained a potential buyout target. The company, which operates as Central Bank of the Midwest, has a strong presence in the state and could be an attractive acquisition for larger regional players looking to expand their reach.\nAccording to industry analysts, Mercantile Bancorp Inc may be attractive to potential buyers due to its size and market position. The bank has more than $2 billion in assets and operates more than 50 branches throughout Missouri and Kansas. With its strong presence in the area, the bank has established a loyal customer base and a solid reputation in the local community.\nIn recent years, Missouri has seen a number of bank mergers and acquisitions as smaller players have struggled to compete in a rapidly changing industry. Larger regional banks, such as UMB Bank, Central Bancompany, Commerce Bancshares, and First Horizon National Corp., have been on the prowl for potential acquisition targets as they seek to expand their market share and gain a competitive advantage.\nFor Mercantile Bancorp Inc, a merger could offer significant benefits, including increased access to capital, expanded product offerings, and greater operational efficiencies. By joining forces with a larger player, the bank could leverage its existing strengths while also gaining access to new resources and expertise.\nThe potential merger could also provide a boost to the local economy. Bank mergers often lead to job cuts and branch closures, but they can also create new employment opportunities as banks seek to expand their operations. Additionally, a larger, more stable bank could help support local businesses and promote economic growth throughout the region.\nWhile no formal announcements have been made regarding a potential buyout of Mercantile Bancorp Inc, industry experts believe that the bank remains a highly attractive target in the ongoing wave of consolidation in Missouri's banking industry. As competition heats up and smaller players struggle to remain relevant, the question remains whether the bank will remain independent, or if it will choose to merge with a larger regional player and position itself for success in the years to come.", "Nippon Life Insurance has recently announced its plan to set up a joint venture in the Philippines.

It presents a valuable opportunity for Nippon Life to expand its international business and tap into the rapidly growing Southeast Asian market. Additionally, it is an excellent opportunity for the Philippines to receive affordable and comprehensive insurance solutions that meet the financial goals of every individual.", "Russia is set to start licensing the export of scrap ferrous and non-ferrous metals to China, India, and the Middle East, as part of its efforts to revive the domestic economy. Despite the move, Western markets remain open, and Russia is willing to continue trading with Europe and the Americas.\nAccording to reports, Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade is now finalizing a mechanism for licensing the export of scrap metals. The new regulations will require exporters to pay a fee to obtain a license, which is aimed at generating revenue for the government and controlling the outflow of scrap metals from the country.\nThe decision to license the export of scrap metals is part of a broader strategy by the Russian government to revive the domestic economy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and international sanctions. Russia has been the world's largest producer and exporter of steel since 2007, and the move is an attempt to stimulate the country's steel industry, which has been hit by reduced demand and low prices.\nThe Russian government has already taken several measures to support the steel industry, including imposing export tariffs on scrap metal and introducing policies aimed at increasing domestic production. These measures have helped stabilize the steel market, but the government is now looking for new ways to boost demand and increase exports.\nRussia's decision to license the export of scrap metals to China, India, and the Middle East has raised concerns that it could lead to a shift in trade away from Western markets. However, Russian officials have emphasized that they are committed to continuing trade with Europe and the Americas.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Russia's Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Reshetnikov, stated that \"we are not shutting doors to Europe or the United States. We are not changing anything in our trade relations with other partners. We are simply creating additional opportunities for our exporters.\"\nReshetnikov also noted that Western markets remain important for Russian exporters because they offer higher prices for scrap metals than China, India, or the Middle East. Nevertheless, he expressed optimism about the potential for increased trade with the East, stating that \"we see significant potential for growth in the East, and we want to create conditions so that our producers have the opportunity to take advantage of this growth.\"\nDespite the government's assurances that it is not turning its back on Western markets, some analysts remain skeptical that trade with Europe and the Americas will remain unaffected. The licensing of scrap metal exports could lead to an increase in the price of steel in Russia, which would make it less competitive in the global market.\nFurthermore, strained relations between Russia and the West over issues such as Ukraine and Syria could limit trade opportunities. The imposition of sanctions by the EU and the US in response to Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has already had a significant impact on Russia's economy, and further sanctions could exacerbate this situation.\nIn conclusion, Russia's decision to license the export of scrap ferrous and non-ferrous metals to China, India, and the Middle East is part of a broader strategy to revive the domestic economy. Despite concerns that this could lead to a shift in trade away from Western markets, Russian officials have emphasized that they remain committed to trade with Europe and the Americas. Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical that trade with the West will remain unaffected, given strained relations and the potential impact of higher steel prices in Russia on its global competitiveness. It remains to be seen whether the licensing of scrap metal exports will have the desired effect of stimulating the country's steel industry and boosting the economy.", "Cable & Wireless shares have soared after the company announced a deal to merge with Liberty Global's Virgin Media, creating the UK's largest cable operator.\nThe deal, valued at $31 billion, will combine the two companies\u2019 expertise in TV, broadband, and mobile services.

Despite concerns about China's human rights record and economic policies, these groups argue that MFN status is essential for maintaining Hong Kong's economic growth and stability.\nThe controversy over MFN status has been brewing for decades. Since 1980, the United States has granted China MFN status, which means that Chinese exports to the country are subject to the same trade conditions as goods from any other country. This has been a major boon to China's economy, helping to transform the country into a major global trading power. However, critics argue that the policy has also enabled China to engage in unfair trade practices and has contributed to a trade deficit with the United States.\nAgainst this backdrop, some U.S. lawmakers and business leaders have called for an end to China's MFN status. They argue that China has failed to live up to its promises to open its markets to foreign competition and has engaged in intellectual property theft and other violations of international trade rules. They also say that China's authoritarian political system is a threat to U.S. national security and that the country's economic policies put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.\nHowever, many Hong Kong business groups disagree with this assessment. They argue that MFN status is critical for Hong Kong's continued economic success and that ending the policy would be a mistake. According to these groups, Hong Kong's economy relies heavily on trade with China, and any disruption to that trade relationship would have severe consequences. They argue that the region's proximity to China makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from the country's economic growth, and that MFN status helps to facilitate that growth.\nMoreover, Hong Kong business leaders point out that China has made significant progress in opening its markets to foreign competition in recent years. They note that the country has taken steps to reduce tariffs and remove barriers to entry for foreign companies. They also argue that China's economic policies are consistent with those of other major trading powers, such as the United States and Japan.\nDespite their arguments, the debate over China's MFN status is likely to continue. U.S. lawmakers have introduced legislation that would require the president to certify every year that China is complying with international trade rules and other standards. If China failed to meet these criteria, the legislation would allow the president to revoke MFN status. Similar legislation has been proposed in the past, but has not gained enough support to pass.\nAs the debate rages on, Hong Kong business groups will continue to speak out in support of MFN status. They believe that the policy is essential for their region's economic growth and stability, and that it would be a mistake to end it. Whether their arguments will be enough to persuade U.S. lawmakers remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the debate over China's MFN status is far from over.", "Beijing, China \u2013 Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has been sentenced to three years in a labour camp after being convicted of \"inciting subversion of state power.\" According to sources, Liu, who is already serving an 11-year prison sentence for his pro-democracy activism, was taken into custody again earlier this year and now faces an additional three years behind bars.\nLiu has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government for many years, and is famous for being a key author of the pro-democracy manifesto called Charter 08. The document, which was released in 2008, called for political reforms and greater human rights protections. In response, Liu was charged with \"inciting subversion of state power\" and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009.\nLiu's sentencing sparked widespread criticism from Western governments and human rights organizations, who argued that he was simply exercising his right to free speech. The Chinese government, however, insists that Liu's actions are illegal and a threat to national security.\nMeanwhile, another pro-democracy activist has gone missing in China. Chen Wei, who was also imprisoned for his role in promoting democracy, has not been seen or heard from since September. Reports suggest that Chen was taken into custody by Chinese police and is being held incommunicado.\nChen's wife, Wang Xiaoyan, says she has no idea where her husband is or what has happened to him. \"I am so worried about him,\" she told reporters. \"I cannot sleep at night. I don't know if he is still alive.\"\nThe Chinese government has not commented on the disappearance of Chen Wei, but this is not the first time that pro-democracy activists have gone missing in China. Indeed, many people believe that the government routinely uses secret detention, torture, and other forms of repression to silence dissent.\nThe sentencing of Liu Xiaobo and the disappearance of Chen Wei come at a time when the Chinese government is cracking down on dissent more broadly. Earlier this year, China passed a new national security law that broadens the government's powers to monitor and control the internet, social media, and other forms of communication. The law has been criticized by human rights organizations and Western governments, who argue that it gives the Chinese government even more tools to silence dissent.\nThe Chinese government, however, argues that these measures are necessary to protect national security and ensure social stability. In a recent statement, the Chinese embassy in the United States defended the country's human rights record, stating that \"China is a country under the rule of law, and everyone is equal before the law. The Chinese people enjoy broad rights and freedoms in accordance with the law.\"\nDespite this claim, many human rights organizations and Western governments remain concerned about the fate of pro-democracy activists in China. They argue that the Chinese government's actions violate international human rights standards and are a threat to free speech and democracy around the world.\nFor Liu Xiaobo and his supporters, the news of his sentencing and Chen Wei's disappearance is deeply concerning. They believe that the Chinese government is simply trying to silence dissent and suppress any calls for political reform. As Liu put it in his now-famous Nobel Peace Prize speech, \"Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights, the source of humanity and the mother of truth. To block freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, to strangle humanity and to suppress the truth.\"", "Daewoo UK, the British subsidiary of South Korean car manufacturer Daewoo Motors, is considering exporting their successful marketing strategy to new markets.\nThe company, which has been operating in the UK since 1995, has established itself as a leading brand in the competitive automotive industry.

This move is in accordance with the company's new growth strategy which focuses on expansion and innovation.\nThe company's management team highlighted the importance of investing in research and development, as well as growth-centered mergers and acquisitions (M&As). These are expected to result in long-term benefits that improve the company's competitiveness and profitability.\nIn light of this strategy, the company's board of directors has approved the share buyback program, which is expected to begin in the next few weeks. The buyback program will be executed in stages, with a target of up to five percent of the company's total shares outstanding.\nMoreover, the company has declared a low-dividend policy for the foreseeable future. The decision to keep dividends low is a reflection of the company's growth-centered strategy, aimed at increasing capital expenditures.\nSpeaking about the new strategy, Mr. John Hendricks, CEO of Millennium Chemicals, said, \"We are pleased to announce these strategic moves that demonstrate our commitment to our growth plans, which are aligned with our long-term objectives and the interests of our shareholders.\"\nHe added, \"Our investment in R&D, expansion and innovation will be key drivers of growth, and we remain committed to finding opportunities to create value for our stakeholders.

With sound financial backing and an innovative strategy, Millennium Chemicals is well-positioned for long-term growth and success.", "San Francisco - On Wednesday, high-tech stocks soared after three ballot proposals that could have hurt the industry were defeated in California during the midterm elections.\nProposition 3, which would have raised $8.9 billion in bonds for water and environmental projects, was rejected by voters. Industry leaders worried that it would have increased taxes. Proposition 6, which would have repealed a gas tax, was also defeated. And Proposition 10, which would have allowed cities to impose rent control on all housing, including single-family homes and new construction, was rejected.\nThe results were a relief for both industry leaders and investors, who feared that the initiatives could have hurt growth and harmed the economy. After the announcement, tech stocks continued to climb higher, buoyed by the positive news.\nFacebook rose 3.7%, while Amazon increased by 4.3%. Apple, which has faced headwinds in recent weeks after revealing a decrease in iPhone sales, also rose by 1.3%. Google parent Alphabet increased by 3.2%, while Microsoft jumped by 4.9%.\nInvestors had been nervous ahead of the vote, given the importance of California for many tech firms. But after the proposals were defeated, the sector breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"We are very pleased that Proposition 10 was defeated,\" said Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and Twitter. \"Rent control would have hurt property owners and would have made it difficult for tech talent to remain in the state.\"\nDorsey was one of several industry leaders who spoke out against the proposals in the lead-up to the election. Other tech executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook, also expressed concern about the initiatives.\n\"Today's vote shows that Californians continue to support growth and innovation,\" said Cook, CEO of Apple. \"We can all breathe easier knowing that the state will continue to be an incubator for new ideas and collaboration.\"\nThe outcome of the vote also suggests that California voters are willing to support tech companies, despite concerns about monopolies and data privacy.\n\"Tech firms have brought enormous wealth and opportunity to California,\" said James Rucker, co-founder of Color of Change, a civil rights group that opposed Proposition 10. \"We must continue to support the industry, while also holding companies accountable.\"\nThe news was also good for hacktivists, who worry that governments will use the internet to clamp down on freedom of speech. California is an important center for tech activism, with many companies and activists working closely with each other to promote civil liberties.\n\"Had these proposals been passed, it would have sent a chilling message to tech companies and activists alike,\" said Bruce Schneier, a security expert and author. \"But this vote shows that Californians are committed to using technology to promote freedom and democracy, not to stifle it.\"\nDespite the positive news, some analysts warned against overoptimism. The technology sector still faces many challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny and concerns about the growth of artificial intelligence.\n\"Tech companies must work hard to build trust with consumers and lawmakers,\" said Trent Herbert, a business analyst. \"They should not take this vote as a reason to become complacent. Instead, they must use the momentum to push for new ideas and innovations.\"\nFor now, however, the tech industry can celebrate a win. As Silicon Valley continues to dominate the global economy, its power and influence are unlikely to wane anytime soon. But with new challenges on the horizon, the sector must remain vigilant and innovative to stay ahead of the game.\nAs the sun set over San Francisco, and the golden light illuminated the Bay Area, it was clear that the tech industry had much to celebrate. And with the defeat of Propositions 3, 6, and 10, the state's economy can continue to thrive.", "CGIP in Talks to Acquire 28% Stake in Valeo SA from Italian Businessman\nParis-based private equity firm, CGIP, is in talks to acquire a 28% stake in Valeo SA from Italian businessman Francesco Garofalo. As per the sources, the stake is currently valued at approximately \u20ac1.2 billion. Valeo SA, based out of France, is a leading supplier of automotive parts and systems globally.\nCGIP is presently discussing financial terms with Garofalo\u2019s holding company, Eventide Funds, which currently owns almost 30% of Valeo's voting rights. The potential sale is subject to the approval of Valeo's board, which is reportedly meeting soon to discuss the matter.\nIf negotiations are successful, CGIP will attain a substantial position in Valeo\u2019s board and will become a major shareholder of the company. The deal comes at a time when the auto industry is undergoing significant changes as electric vehicles become increasingly popular and advancements in autonomous driving.\nThe acquisition of the stake in Valeo SA will further boost CGIP\u2019s portfolio, which already has major holdings in trucking parts supplier Jost, and French telecommunications provider, SFR Group.\nSources suggest that the deal could be completed by the end of the year. However, no official confirmation has been provided from CGIP or Valeo SA about the discussions and it has not yet been confirmed whether the deal will be accepted by Valeo. \nThis potential acquisition by CGIP is a bold move and displays confidence in Valeo\u2019s future growth prospects. The company recently announced its medium-term 2025 vision of generating over \u20ac27 billion in annual revenue by 2025, riding high on new technologies and demand for hybrid and electric vehicles.\nValeo is also looking to expand its business with Chinese automakers and create new collaborations in emerging markets such as India, Vietnam, and Thailand, to tap into the fast-growing demand for its products.\nConversely, with the acquisition of Valeo\u2019s stake, CGIP will gain a strong foothold in the automotive market. Valeo\u2019s position in the global automotive industry is likely to benefit CGIP in terms of market diversification and increased investment opportunity.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of the 28% stake of Valeo SA by CGIP will be a significant move which is likely to benefit both companies in the long run. It remains to be seen whether this potential acquisition will be accepted and result in a successful deal.", "The Czech Republic is set to hold the second round of voting in its Senate elections on Friday, but analysts are already predicting that the outcome is unlikely to provide any clarity for the country's political future.\nThe Senate is the upper house of the Czech parliament and is comprised of 81 members, each of whom serves six-year terms. The elections are held in two rounds, with the first round taking place on October 2-3 and the second round on October 9-10.\nThe Senate has limited powers, but it can play an important role in shaping the country's political landscape. In particular, the Senate has the power to approve or reject legislation passed by the lower house of parliament, as well as to investigate government officials and hold votes of no confidence in the government.\nAt present, the Czech government is headed by Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who leads the ANO party. Babis has been in office since 2017 and his government has faced a number of challenges, including corruption allegations and widespread protests over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the fact that Babis does not hold a majority in the lower house of parliament. Instead, he governs with the support of other parties, including the Social Democrats and the Communist Party.\nThe Senate elections have been closely watched as a potential barometer of public opinion and a potential source of further political instability. However, it appears that the outcome is unlikely to provide any clear direction for the country.\nAccording to a poll conducted by the Prague-based STEM agency, the ANO party is expected to win only four of the 27 seats in the second round of the Senate elections. That would leave the party with a total of 22 seats, down from the 23 seats it currently holds.\nThe Czech Pirate Party is expected to make gains in the Senate, potentially adding as many as six seats to its current total of two. The center-right Civic Democrats are also expected to perform well, with some polls suggesting they could win five or more seats.\nOther parties, including the Communist Party and the Social Democrats, are projected to lose seats in the Senate. The Communist Party is expected to lose as many as three seats, leaving it with only eight seats in the upper house. The Social Democrats are projected to lose one or two seats, leaving them with only six or seven seats.\nDespite the potential for political turmoil, analysts believe that the markets have already priced in the uncertainty. The Czech koruna has weakened slightly in recent weeks, but it has not experienced any major fluctuations.\nSimilarly, the Prague stock market has remained relatively stable, suggesting that investors are not overly concerned about the political situation in the country.\nThis is partly due to the fact that the Czech economy has performed relatively well in recent years, with steady growth and low unemployment. However, the country is heavily dependent on exports, particularly to other European Union countries, and any disruption to trade could have significant implications for the economy.\nFor now, it seems that the Czech Senate elections are unlikely to provide any clarity for the country's political future, but investors and analysts appear to be taking the situation in stride. However, the situation could change quickly if there are any major surprises in the second round of voting or if there is a significant shift in political sentiment in the coming weeks and months.", "Ford Motor Company announced its third-quarter results on Thursday, October 28, 2021, revealing a profit that almost doubled from last year. The American multinational automaker reported a net profit of $1.93 billion, up from $986 million in the same period last year, boosted by strong demand for its trucks and SUVs in North America and China.\nDespite this positive development, Ford's European operations posted a loss of $426 million, a cause for concern among analysts. The region has long been a weak spot for the company, which said it is taking steps to address the issue.\n\"We delivered a strong quarter, led by continued strong demand for our industry-leading trucks and SUVs,\" said Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler in a statement. \"Despite semiconductor supply constraints, we've been able to continue to operate our plants efficiently and deliver vehicles to customers.\"\nIn North America, Ford's largest market, the company saw a 20% increase in revenue, primarily driven by strong sales of its F-150 pickup truck. Similarly, in China, its second-largest market, Ford's revenue surged by 40%, driven by its success in the SUV segment.\nHowever, the automotive industry continues to face supply chain challenges caused by a global semiconductor shortage, resulting in production cuts and delays. Ford lowered its production forecast for the fourth quarter due to the chip supply constraint, signaling that the industry is unlikely to get out of the woods in the short term.\nThe supply chain crunch has also led to rising prices of new cars and used cars, creating inflationary pressures. Ford's average transaction price per vehicle increased by nearly $4,000 to a record $49,400 in the third quarter, a development that partly offset the ongoing production challenges.\nFord CEO Jim Farley said the company expects to face continued volatility and uncertainty in the short term but is confident in its long-term strategy.\n\"The pandemic is far from over, and the supply chain challenges are far from over,\" Farley said during a conference call. \"But we believe that we're building a better Ford, a Ford that's fit, a Ford that's ready to grow and compete.\"\nFord is in the midst of a major restructuring under Farley, who took over the company's helm last year. The CEO has focused on streamlining Ford's operations, improving its profitability, and investing in electric and autonomous vehicles to compete with the likes of Tesla Inc. and General Motors Co.\nThe automaker has pledged to spend $30 billion on electric vehicles through 2025, with plans to have 40% of its vehicle volume electric by 2030. Ford recently launched its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck, which has received an overwhelming response from consumers and is expected to hit showrooms next year.\nFord is also investing in autonomous driving technology and partnerships with tech companies to expand its revenue streams beyond traditional car sales. The company has struck a deal with Alphabet Inc.'s self-driving subsidiary Waymo to develop self-driving commercial vehicles.\nDespite Ford's positive developments, such as its electric-vehicle push and the growth of its truck and SUV segments in North America and China, analysts remain wary of the company's European losses, which they say are a persistent issue.\n\"It's always been a weak spot, and it's been difficult for Ford to make a turnaround in Europe,\" said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor at Kelley Blue Book. \"The company is taking steps to address it, but it remains a headwind.\"\nFord said it is continuing to focus on its European turnaround plan, which includes cost cuts, better capital allocation, and launching new EVs, such as the Mustang Mach-E and the all-electric Transit van.\nThe company's shares closed down nearly 3% on the day of the earnings release, reflecting some investor unease over the European losses. However, despite these challenges, Ford's leadership remains bullish about the future and its ability to compete in the rapidly evolving automotive industry.\n\"We're focused on what we have control over, and that's our transformation and our business plan,\" Farley said. \"We have a great plan, and we're executing it, and I think people are starting to see that.\"", "Indonesia's mutual funds industry is in dire need of government support to thrive, industry experts have said. According to them, the current business environment is stifling the growth of the industry, which has the potential to become a key pillar of the country's economy.\nThe recent pandemic has brought to the fore the importance of investment diversification among individuals, which is where mutual funds come into play. Mutual funds, which pool money from different investors to invest in a range of assets, are seen as a safer option than investing in individual stocks or bonds.\nHowever, the mutual funds industry in Indonesia has failed to take off as expected due to various challenges. The industry currently accounts for only 2% of the country's capital market, compared to 20-30% in developed countries. Additionally, less than 1% of the country's population currently invests in mutual funds.\nOne of the major issues in the industry is the lack of investor awareness and trust. People are generally hesitant to invest in financial products due to a lack of understanding and the perception that they are risky. The government needs to step up its efforts to educate the public about the benefits of investing in mutual funds and how they can help grow their financial portfolios.\nAnother challenge is the regulatory environment. Indonesia's mutual fund industry is heavily regulated, which has made it difficult for companies to launch new funds or even make changes to existing ones. This has resulted in limited product offerings, which in turn has led to lower investor participation. The government needs to simplify the regulatory framework to encourage more players to enter the market and create innovative products for consumers.\nSpeaking about the need for government support, Agus Riyanto, Chairman of the Indonesian Mutual Funds Association, said, \"The government should provide incentives to mutual fund managers who can deliver significantly better returns than market benchmarks. It can increase the thresholds for tax allowances for individual investors, provide tax incentives for mutual fund managers and reduce fees imposed by regulators.\"\nOverall, there is immense potential for the mutual funds industry in Indonesia to flourish and contribute significantly to the economy. However, to achieve this, there needs to be concerted efforts from both the government and the industry players. With increased investor awareness, simplified regulations and government support, the mutual funds industry in Indonesia can become a major contributor to the country's economic growth.", "Komercni Banka a.s. announced on Wednesday that they have seen a 10% dip in their profits due to recent accounting changes. Despite the dip, shares rose on analyst praise, showcasing the resilience of the Czech banking giant.\nKomercni Banka a.s. has been a pillar of the Czech banking sector since its establishment in 1990. The bank has continuously shown remarkable stability and growth over the years, but the recent accounting changes have caused a temporary hit to its profitability.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Komercni Banka a.s. explained that the dip in profits was due to the adoption of IFRS 9, an accounting standard that came into effect on January 1, 2018. IFRS 9 requires banks to make provisions for expected credit losses on loans and other financial assets, which resulted in a drop in Komercni Banka a.s.\u2019s profit for the first half of 2018.\nDespite the dip in profits, shares of the bank rose as investors and analysts praised the bank\u2019s resilience and long-term potential. The shares rose by 1.3%, reaching their highest level in six weeks.\nThe bank\u2019s CEO, Jan Juchelka, said in a statement that although the change resulted in a short-term dip in profitability, it will have a positive long-term impact on the bank\u2019s stability and risk management. He added that the bank remains committed to maintaining and growing its market share in the Czech banking sector.\nThe bank\u2019s net profit for the first half of 2018 fell to CZK 5.37 billion ($239 million), down from CZK 5.99 billion ($266 million) in the same period last year. However, the bank\u2019s total operating income rose to CZK 12.59 billion ($559 million), up 9.7% from the same period last year.\nKomercni Banka a.s. has a strong history of profitability and stability, with an impressive track record of dividend payouts. The bank has consistently delivered solid returns to its shareholders, and the recent dip in profits is not expected to have a significant impact on its long-term performance.\nAnalysts have praised the bank\u2019s management team for their proactive approach to risk management and the bank\u2019s proactive approach to adopting the new accounting standard. They believe that the bank\u2019s focus on diversification, innovation and efficiency will help it maintain its position as one of the top banks in the Czech Republic.\nIn summary, Komercni Banka a.s. has seen a 10% dip in its profits due to recent accounting changes but remains a strong and stable player in the Czech banking sector. Shares rose as analysts praised the bank\u2019s resilience and long-term potential. The bank remains committed to maintaining and growing its market share in the Czech banking sector, with a focus on diversification, innovation and efficiency.", "In the midst of growing criticism and concerns over the Joint Strike Fighter program, the President of Boeing's Defense and Space Group, Leanne Caret, exuded optimism over the program's survival.\nSpeaking at an industry event yesterday, Caret acknowledged that the F-35 program had faced challenges, including cost overruns, technical issues, and delays in production. However, she expressed confidence in the program's future and praised the efforts of the Department of Defense, military and industry partners.\n\"Despite the challenges, I am incredibly proud of the progress that has been made. The F-35 not only meets but exceeds the requirements set out for it, and I believe it will be a game-changer for our military capabilities,\" said Caret.\nCaret's remarks come as the program has faced increased scrutiny in recent years. In 2019, a leaked report from the Pentagon's testing office revealed a range of issues with the F-35, including software problems and issues with cybersecurity. Last year, the Government Accountability Office released a report warning of further delays and cost overruns.\nDespite these setbacks, the F-35 program has continued to move forward. Last year, the Department of Defense announced its intention to purchase an additional 78 F-35s, and the program has received significant support from both the military and the aerospace industry.\nCaret noted that one positive aspect of the program's challenges has been the focus on continual improvement and innovation. \"We're constantly looking for ways to improve the aircraft, improve the process, and reduce costs. It's been a catalyst for driving innovation,\" she said.\nThe Boeing Defense and Space Group is not directly involved in the F-35 program, as it does not manufacture any of the aircraft or components. However, the company's defense division is a significant contractor for the military and has a vested interest in the success of the program.\nCaret emphasized the importance of continued investment in the F-35, both from the military and the aerospace industry. \"We must ensure that we remain vigilant in investing in the future capabilities of our military. The F-35 program is critical to our national security, and we cannot afford to let it falter,\" she said.\nOverall, Caret's remarks reflect the ongoing debate over the F-35 program and its future. While the program has faced significant setbacks and has been criticized heavily, there is still hope that it can ultimately fulfill its intended role as a next-generation fighter jet. As industry and military leaders continue to work towards improving the program and addressing its challenges, the F-35's future remains uncertain but still hopeful.", "Silver King Communications has announced that it will buy the Home Shopping Network for $1.3 billion in stock. This acquisition has sparked speculation that the former chairman and CEO of HSN, Barry Diller, may launch a new television network utilizing the HSN platform. \nSilver King, which operates a group of 14 television stations, will acquire 61% of HSN's outstanding shares in exchange for its own shares on a tax-free basis.

Upon completion of the acquisition, HSN will become a subsidiary of Silver King, and HSN's current management team will remain in place. \nThe acquisition will create a powerful new media company with a diverse array of content and distribution platforms. Silver King's stations reach 16% of all U.S. households, while HSN has a dedicated customer base of over 90 million homes. \nHSN has been a pioneer in the television retail industry, generating more than $4 billion in annual revenue from the sale of consumer products via its TV and online platforms. The company has also been expanding its digital offerings, including mobile shopping and social media integration. \nBarry Diller, who launched HSN in 1986 and served as its CEO until 1995, is considered one of the most successful media executives of the past century. After leaving HSN, Diller went on to lead several major media companies, including Paramount Pictures, Fox Broadcasting, and USA Networks. \nDiller has remained involved with HSN as a board member and investor, owning approximately 3% of the company's stock. He has previously expressed interest in launching a new television network designed for the digital age. \nMany industry experts believe that the acquisition of HSN by Silver King could be a catalyst for Diller's next venture. With HSN's vast customer database, production capabilities, and distribution network, Diller could potentially launch a new digital channel that combines traditional television programming with e-commerce, social media, and interactive features. \nDiller has not commented publicly on his plans, but he has previously stated that the traditional television industry is ripe for disruption. \"What's disruptive is the extension of the present successful business model that's been going on for decade after decade,\" Diller said in a 2016 interview. \"That's what gets disrupted.\" \nThe acquisition of HSN could also position Silver King as a major player in the rapidly evolving media landscape. As viewers increasingly consume content across multiple platforms, companies are looking for ways to leverage their existing assets to reach new audiences. \nIn recent years, HSN has expanded into new areas such as health and wellness, travel, and culinary products. The acquisition by Silver King could provide new opportunities for cross-promotion and syndication with other Silver King properties. \n\"HSN has built a powerful platform in the world of retail television, and we're excited to be joining forces with them,\" said Mark Strong, CEO of Silver King Communications. \"Together, we believe we can create new opportunities for growth and innovation in the media industry.\" \nThe acquisition of HSN by Silver King is the latest in a series of major media mergers and acquisitions in recent years, including AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner and Disney's purchase of 21st Century Fox's assets. As the industry continues to consolidate, companies are looking for ways to differentiate themselves and stay ahead of the competition. \nThe potential launch of a new television network by Barry Diller is just one example of the bold moves being made by media executives to adapt to the changing landscape. With the acquisition of HSN by Silver King, the stage is set for the next phase of innovation in the media industry.", "In an effort to keep up with ever-changing technology and stay competitive in the global marketplace, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has announced the launch of its new trading system, Sequence 6.

These included the introduction of a new multi-currency settlement system and a new surveillance platform that uses machine learning to scan for potential market manipulation and other fraudulent activity.\nThe LSE's focus on technology is part of a broader trend across the financial sector, as companies seek to gain a competitive advantage by leveraging artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies. This has become even more important in recent years, as the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital platforms and remote work.\nThe LSE's move to upgrade its trading systems has been welcomed by many in the industry, who say that the improvements will help the exchange stay competitive and attract new customers. \"The LSE has always been at the forefront of innovation in the financial sector, and this latest modernisation program is no exception,\" said financial analyst Sarah Johnson. \"By investing in cutting-edge technology, the exchange is positioning itself to meet the needs of traders in an increasingly digital world.\"\nThe launch of Sequence 6 comes at a time of great uncertainty for the financial sector, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact markets around the world.

With this development, the retailer has become the first supermarket in the UK to offer banking services.\nThis exciting new partnership will enable Sainsbury's customers to access a range of financial products, including savings accounts, loans, credit cards, and insurance policies. This move comes after Sainsbury's successfully launched its own banking division in 2012, which has steadily grown to include over 2 million active customers.\nThe new range of financial services has been designed to offer customers competitive rates and a simple, straightforward approach to banking. Sainsbury's Bank CEO Jim Brown said, \"We know our customers want banking services that are convenient, accessible and easy to use, so we're delighted to be launching this partnership with Bank of Scotland. Together, we'll be able to offer customers a wider range of products and services that cater to their varied needs.\"\nThe partnership has been made possible through an agreement with the Halifax, which is part of Bank of Scotland's parent company, Lloyds Banking Group. Under the arrangement, Halifax will provide certain banking products, such as mortgages and home insurance, while Sainsbury's will continue to offer its own branded products alongside these.\nThis is a significant move for Sainsbury's, as it seeks to expand its range of services and become a more diversified business. Banking services are a natural extension of the supermarket's existing portfolio, which includes financial services, mobile phones, and energy. By offering a full range of financial products, Sainsbury's hopes to become a one-stop-shop for its customers' needs, helping them to save both time and money.\nThe partnership is also significant for Bank of Scotland, which is looking to expand its presence in the retail banking market. The bank has a strong reputation for providing high-quality banking services to both personal and business customers, and its partnership with Sainsbury's will enable it to reach a wider audience.\nThe new range of banking services will be available through Sainsbury's Bank from early next year, with customers able to apply online, over the phone, or in-store. Sainsbury's will also be offering a range of incentives to encourage customers to switch their current accounts, including cashback offers and discounted rates on loans and credit cards.\nJim Brown added, \"We're excited about the prospect of working with Bank of Scotland to offer our customers a broader range of products. This partnership brings together two trusted brands that share a commitment to putting customers first, and we look forward to the benefits it will bring to our customers.\"\nThe move by Sainsbury's into the retail banking market is part of a wider trend across the industry, as supermarkets look to diversify their businesses and offer customers a wider range of services. Tesco Bank has been offering banking services to its customers since 1997, while Asda Money was launched in 2012. Both companies now offer a range of financial products, including loans, credit cards, and insurance.\nThe launch of Sainsbury's new banking services comes at a time of increased competition in the UK financial services market, with challenger banks and fintech startups challenging established players. However, Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland will be hoping that their partnership will enable them to compete effectively and offer customers a strong alternative to the established high street banks.\nSainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said, \"This is a really exciting development for Sainsbury's, as we look to offer our customers a wider range of services and become a more diversified business. We believe that the new banking services we're launching in partnership with Bank of Scotland will be a valuable addition to our existing offering, and we're looking forward to seeing the benefits it will bring to our customers.\"", "In a first-of-its-kind move, SaveSmart Inc. is all set to introduce a credit card-based savings scheme for online coupon clipping.

The new organization aims to target the non-unionized workforce and foreign companies operating in the country.\n\"The creation of the Industry-Wide Front is a critical turning point in the history of labor rights in Colombia,\" said Jos\u00e9 Altamiranda, the newly appointed President of the Industry-Wide Front. \"Our goal is simple: to unite all workers in the oil, mining, and energy industry behind a common cause. We will fight for better wages, safer working conditions, and the right to organize.\"\nCurrently, only around 20% of Colombia's oil and gas workforce is unionized. The industry, which accounts for over 7% of Colombia's GDP, has long been dominated by foreign companies, including the likes of ExxonMobil, BP, and Shell. These companies have often come under fire for their treatment of workers and the impact of their operations on local communities and the environment.\n\"We cannot allow foreign companies to come into our country and exploit our natural resources without giving back to the local community,\" Altamiranda continued. \"We need to ensure that workers are given a fair share of the profits generated by these companies, and that the environment is protected.\"\nThe move was welcomed by other labor unions across the country, who see it as a positive step towards greater solidarity among workers. \"The Industry-Wide Front is a symbol of hope for all workers in Colombia,\" said Luis Eladio Arango, the Secretary-General of the Colombian General Workers' Union. \"We stand in solidarity with our colleagues in the oil, mining, and energy sectors and will support them in their fight for better working conditions and fair treatment.\"\nThe creation of the Industry-Wide Front comes at a crucial time for Colombia, which has seen a rise in political and social unrest in recent years. The country has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many workers in the oil and gas sector losing their jobs or facing reduced hours.\n\"We are living through tough times, but the Industry-Wide Front is proof that we can come together as workers, demand better conditions, and build a better future for ourselves and for our country,\" Altamiranda said. \"We are stronger together, and we will not stop fighting until every worker in Colombia is treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\"", "Jakarta, Indonesia \u2013 A new cleansing process in Indonesia\u2019s financial sector is paving the way for Islamic mutual funds to grow in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country.\nThe Indonesian financial sector regulator, the Financial Services Authority (OJK), recently announced a new set of policies aimed at improving Sharia compliance in the country\u2019s banking and capital markets.\nAs part of these policies, OJK introduced a new system of certification for businesses and Sharia compliance experts, to ensure that all Islamic financial products in the country are fully compliant with Sharia principles.\nThis new system is already paying dividends for the country\u2019s Islamic mutual fund industry. According to data from the OJK, assets under management in Sharia-compliant mutual funds grew by 34% in 2020, with total assets reaching IDR 33.9 trillion ($2.3 billion).\nThis growth was driven by a number of factors, including increased investor awareness of Islamic finance, greater demand for ethically responsible investments, and the fact that the new certification system is making it easier for investors to identify Sharia-compliant funds.\nThe OJK is also working to encourage further growth in the industry by developing new regulations that allow mutual funds to invest in a wider range of Sharia-compliant assets.\nIn the past, Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia were largely limited to investments in the country\u2019s stock market, as there were limited opportunities to invest in other asset classes that met the strict criteria for Sharia compliance. However, OJK is now exploring the possibility of allowing mutual funds to invest in a wider range of Sharia-compliant assets, including commodities, real estate, and infrastructure.\nThis could open up a whole new range of investment opportunities for Sharia-compliant funds in Indonesia, allowing them to diversify their portfolios and attract more investors.\nOne of the key benefits of investing in Islamic mutual funds is their focus on ethical and socially responsible investing. Unlike conventional funds, which may invest in companies involved in activities such as gambling, alcohol, or tobacco, Islamic mutual funds are required to avoid any businesses that do not comply with Sharia principles.\nThis means that investors in Islamic mutual funds can be confident that their money is being invested in a way that aligns with their ethical and moral values.\nThe growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is also part of a wider trend in the global financial sector, as investors increasingly seek out ethically responsible investment options.\nThe global Islamic finance industry is expected to be worth $3.8 trillion by 2023, and Indonesia is well-positioned to be a major player in this market.\nWith a population of over 260 million, the country has the largest Muslim population in the world. This, combined with a rapidly-growing middle class and a strong appetite for Islamic finance, makes Indonesia a key market for the industry.\nThe growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is also part of a wider trend towards greater financial inclusion and democratization of the financial sector.\nBy making it easier for investors to access Sharia-compliant investment options, Indonesia is helping to open up the financial sector to a wider range of people, including those who may have previously been excluded from traditional financial services.\nOverall, the growth of Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia is a positive sign for the country\u2019s financial sector, and for the global Islamic finance industry as a whole.\nAs more investors become aware of the ethical and socially responsible nature of these funds, and as the industry continues to develop new investment opportunities and products, we are likely to see continued growth in the sector in the years to come.", "Air France has announced that it is ready to take on competition from British Airways in the domestic market, following the recent acquisition of the French airline Aigle Azur.\nThe acquisition of Aigle Azur, which went bankrupt in September 2019, has given Air France a significant boost in its domestic operations.

Air France also gained access to Aigle Azur's customer base, which includes a loyal following of business travelers.\nAir France CEO, Anne Rigail, said in a recent interview, \"The acquisition of Aigle Azur has given us a valuable opportunity to strengthen our position in the French domestic market. We are now able to offer more flights and destinations to our customers, particularly those who travel for business.\"\nBritish Airways has been expanding its presence in the French market in recent years, following its acquisition of the low-cost airline, Monarch. The airline has been offering flights between London and Paris, as well as other popular destinations in France. However, Air France is confident that it can compete with British Airways in the domestic market, especially with its new acquisition.\n\"We welcome competition in the market as it keeps us focused on delivering the best possible service to our customers. We believe we are well-positioned to take on British Airways and other airlines in the French domestic market,\" Rigail added.\nAir France has already announced plans to expand its domestic operations, with the addition of new routes and increased frequency on existing routes. The airline is also investing in new aircraft, such as the Airbus A220, a highly-efficient aircraft that is ideal for short-haul flights.\nAir France is also planning to improve its customer service, with the introduction of new digital services and improved onboard amenities. In addition, the airline is working on reducing its carbon footprint by investing in sustainable aviation fuel and implementing measures to reduce its waste and energy consumption.\nThe French government has also shown its support for Air France in its bid to take on British Airways, with its recent announcement of a \u20ac7 billion aid package for the airline. The package includes loans and guarantees, as well as state equity investment, to help Air France weather the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAir France is confident that its strong brand, domestic network, and new acquisition, will give it an edge over its competitors in the French market. With the support of the French government and its commitment to sustainable aviation, the airline is poised to take on British Airways and other airlines in the French domestic market.\nIn conclusion, Air France's acquisition of Aigle Azur has given it a valuable opportunity to strengthen its position in the French domestic market. The airline is now poised to take on competition from British Airways, with plans to expand its domestic operations, improve its customer service, and invest in sustainable aviation. With the support of the French government and its commitment to innovation, Air France is confident it can stay ahead of its competitors and emerge as a leader in the French aviation market.", "Beijing, China - Wang Dan, a prominent Chinese activist, is set to stand trial for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government. The trial is scheduled to take place on June 17 in Tianjin, a major city located east of Beijing.\nWang, who is known for his pro-democracy activism, was arrested last year and charged with \"inciting subversion of state power\" and \"conspiring to subvert state power.\" He has been accused of secretly organizing a network of activists to destabilize the Chinese government and incite political unrest.\nThe Chinese government has been cracking down on dissent and pro-democracy activists for years. In recent years, the government has been particularly harsh on activists who advocate for greater political freedoms and human rights.\nWang, who was a key figure in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, has been an outspoken critic of the Chinese government for decades. He was jailed for four years following the protests and was subsequently re-arrested and jailed in 1995 for his activism.\nDespite his long history of activism and defiance, Wang was surprised by his latest arrest. He had been living in the United States for several years, where he had been teaching at a university and advocating for democracy in China.\nWang's trial is likely to be closely watched by human rights groups and activists around the world. Many have condemned the Chinese government's treatment of Wang, arguing that his arrest and forthcoming trial are part of a broader crackdown on dissent and political opposition.\nIn a statement, Amnesty International called on the Chinese government to drop all charges against Wang and release him immediately. \"Wang Dan is a peaceful and dedicated activist who has spent his life fighting for the rights of the Chinese people,\" the group said. \"His arrest and trial are a clear attempt to silence him and other brave activists who dare to challenge the Chinese government's repressive policies.\"\nOther human rights groups have echoed Amnesty International's concerns. Human Rights Watch, for example, has criticized the Chinese government for its treatment of Wang and other pro-democracy activists. \"The Chinese government has a long history of persecuting and mistreating its citizens who advocate for greater political freedoms and human rights,\" the group said in a statement. \"Wang Dan's trial is just the latest example of this troubling trend.\"\nDespite the protests and calls for his release, it is unclear what the outcome of Wang's trial will be. If he is found guilty, he could face years in prison or even a possible death sentence. Many of his supporters are holding out hope that he will be acquitted and released, but they acknowledge that the Chinese government's record on human rights is not encouraging.\nFor now, Wang remains in custody in Tianjin, awaiting his trial. His supporters have organized rallies and protests around the world to demonstrate their solidarity with him and to advocate for his release. They are hoping that the Chinese government will heed their calls for justice and release Wang unconditionally, but they acknowledge that the road ahead is long and difficult.\nWhatever the outcome of his trial, Wang's case will continue to serve as a powerful symbol of the struggle for democracy and human rights in China. His courage and dedication to the cause of freedom have inspired countless activists and human rights defenders around the world, and his spirit will continue to animate the struggle for justice and equality in China and beyond.", "AMSTERDAM \u2013 The Netherlands-based bank, ABN AMRO, has announced plans to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp in a deal valued at $1.9 billion, propelling the bank into becoming the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States.\nThe acquisition, set to be finalized by the end of the year, is a strategic move by ABN AMRO to expand its mortgage business in the United States. The bank already has a strong presence in the region with over 30 branches across 13 states.\nStandard Federal Bancorp, based in Michigan, has assets worth $13.6 billion and 96 branches across the Midwest region of the United States. With its acquisition, ABN AMRO will have access to a wider customer base, enabling it to offer a broader range of financial services.\n\u201cAcquiring Standard Federal Bancorp is a significant step forward for our mortgage business in the United States.

According to data from Inside Mortgage Finance, ABN AMRO currently ranks 14th in the United States in terms of mortgage lending.\nThe acquisition also comes at a time when the US housing market is booming. Despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for housing has remained strong, with record-low mortgage rates fueling a surge in home purchases and refinancing.\nThe US housing market is expected to remain strong in the foreseeable future, driven by low-interest rates, high demand, and tight supply. ABN AMRO will be well-positioned to capitalize on this trend with its expanded mortgage business.\nThe acquisition of Standard Federal Bancorp is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

The British home improvement retailer is preparing to take an additional charge of around \u00a310m ($13m) as it continues to assess the impact of the errors.\nThe new charge follows an original charge of \u00a37.5m ($9.8m) that Wickes announced in November 2020. This first charge was related to an overstatement of profits, which resulted in a misstatement of its financial results for the first half of the year. The company said it had identified the issue during its year-end audit process, which was conducted by PwC.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Wickes said that the new charge would be taken in its full-year results for 2020, which are expected to be released on March 24. The company said it now expects its underlying profit before tax for the year to be between \u00a345m ($58.6m) and \u00a348m ($62.5m), compared to previous guidance of between \u00a355m and \u00a359m.\nThe accounting discrepancies relate to the application of commercial discounts to certain suppliers, and the timing of certain costs in relation to the timing of revenue recognition. The company said it has taken action to address the issues, including adopting new policies and procedures, and providing additional training to its finance team.\nIn its statement, Wickes said: \"We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of financial reporting and governance, and we deeply regret the impact that these issues have had on our stakeholders. We have taken immediate action to address the matters identified and are working hard to strengthen our internal controls and processes.\"\nThe company's shares fell by more than 5% following the news of the additional charge. However, Wickes said it remains confident in its long-term prospects, and has recently announced plans to open new stores and expand its range of products.\nWickes is not the only British company to have recently discovered accounting discrepancies. In December 2020, supermarket chain Tesco agreed to pay \u00a3129m ($168m) to settle a lawsuit brought by shareholders over an accounting scandal in 2014. The scandal saw Tesco overstate its profits by \u00a3263m ($342m), and resulted in a number of senior executives being suspended or forced to resign.", "In a bold move to challenge the dominance of computer industry giants Microsoft and Intel, Sun Microsystems has introduced JavaStation, a network computer designed to simplify computer use and reduce costs for businesses and consumers.\nThe JavaStation, which runs on the Java operating system, is a compact device that connects to a server over a network and offers users a range of applications and services. It does not have a hard drive or diskettes, but instead uses a smart card or USB drive for storage. The JavaStation is designed to be easy to set up and use, making it an attractive option for small businesses and home users.\nSun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy said the JavaStation was part of a broader effort to make computing more affordable and accessible to all. \"The JavaStation is an example of our commitment to simplify computing and reduce costs,\" McNealy said at a press conference announcing the product. \"We believe that by leveraging network computing, we can provide not only more affordable solutions for businesses and consumers, but also more convenient and flexible solutions.\"\nThe JavaStation is just one part of Sun's broader strategy to challenge Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. Sun has long been a leader in network computing, which involves using powerful servers to provide computing services to users over a network. Sun's Java programming language, introduced in 1995, has become a popular choice for building web-based applications and services that run on a variety of devices.\nBy focusing on network computing and open standards like Java, Sun has positioned itself as an alternative to Microsoft and Intel's closed, proprietary approach. Sun's strategy has not always been successful, however. In the early 2000s, Sun struggled financially as the dot-com bubble burst and the company's hardware business faced fierce competition from Dell and other low-cost PC makers.\nBut Sun has rebounded in recent years, thanks in part to strong demand for its servers and storage products. In 2009, Sun was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which has continued to invest in the company's technology and products.\nThe JavaStation is one of Sun's most ambitious efforts to challenge Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. The device is designed to offer a low-cost, simple alternative to traditional desktop computers, which can be expensive and complicated to manage.\nAccording to Sun, the JavaStation is ideal for businesses that need to deploy a large number of computers quickly and easily, such as call centers or retail stores. The device can be customized with specific applications and services to meet the needs of different businesses.\nIn addition to the JavaStation, Sun has introduced a range of other products and services aimed at challenging Microsoft and Intel's dominance in the computer industry. These include the Solaris operating system, which competes with Microsoft's Windows and Linux; the MySQL database, which competes with Microsoft's SQL Server and Oracle's own database products; and the OpenOffice productivity suite, which competes with Microsoft Office.\nWhile Sun's strategy of focusing on open standards and network computing has won it many fans in the industry, it has also faced criticism from some who say the company has been slow to adapt to changing market conditions.

The gelding, owned by Tom Palin and trained by Richard Spencer, added the Pardubice Steeplechase, the Czech Republic\u2019s most famous race, to his Roll right or wrong and Hertz point-to-point wins in the space of a remarkable four weeks.\nIt's a Snip carried the hopes of a British contingent that descended upon the central European country in the hope of retaining the prized steeplechase. It was achieved in style as Spencer's eight-year-old powered home 10 lengths clear of the chasing pack.\nThe British challenge began on good footing, with It's a Snip and stablemate Palmer's Hill supplemented by The Young Master - fresh off his lucrative victory in Sunday's Badger Ales Trophy - heading to Pardubice as favourites to wrap up a British one-two-three.

Trainer Richard Spencer said: \"I'm so pleased with him. He was electric.

I don't think he's ever not completed a course but his jumping was unbelievable today.\"\nThe Pardubice Steeplechase has been won by a British horse for five years running, a trend that was continued thanks to an expertly-timed ride from David. \"You need a lot of luck, but he's taken to it so well and jumping is what he does,\" said David of his mount after a triumphant return to the paddock.\nIt's a Snip will head back to the UK with the biggest prize in Eastern European racing under his belt, but the future is far from decided for the all-conquering steeplechaser. \"We'll have to see what happens now,\" said Palin. \"There's a few options on the table.

Prices of vegetables and fruit grew at a slower pace, while meat prices fell slightly.\nThe moderation in price growth was also helped by a slight appreciation of the Czech crown against the euro.\n\"The inflation rate in October 2021 was affected by a slowdown of food price growth, a slight appreciation of the Czech crown, and increased base effects,\" the statistics office said in a statement.\nAlthough inflation moderated, it remains well above the Czech National Bank's target range of 2 percent, with some economists predicting that it could reach 10 percent by the end of the year.\nThe central bank has raised interest rates by a total of 200 basis points to 1.25 percent since August to combat inflationary pressures, and is expected to raise rates further when it meets on 16 December.

This is in part due to the ongoing pandemic, which has increased the need for reliable and affordable communication services.\nAccording to industry reports, the regional bells - which include AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink - have seen a 4.8% increase in earnings in the third quarter, compared to the same period in 2020. The gains have been driven by a surge in demand for broadband and related services, as more people work from home, attend school remotely, and consume entertainment through streaming services.\nGTE Corp, which provides telecommunications and wireless services to residential and business customers, has also experienced robust growth in the third quarter. The company's revenue rose by 7% in the period, compared to the same quarter last year, thanks to strong sales of wireless devices and an increase in postpaid subscribers.\nThe strong financial performance of both the regional bells and GTE Corp is also a reflection of their continued investments in network infrastructure and technology, which have enabled them to provide high-quality services to customers. In addition, they have aggressively expanded their offerings to include new services beyond traditional voice and data services.\nIndustry analysts predict that the demand for telephone services will continue to grow in the coming months, as more businesses and consumers are expected to adopt remote work models. This is likely to fuel further growth in the sector, and both the regional bells and GTE Corp are well-positioned to take advantage of the trend.\nDespite the positive outlook for the industry, some challenges remain for the regional bells and GTE Corp. The ongoing chip shortage, for example, could disrupt the supply chain for new devices and equipment, which could impact their ability to meet increasing demand for their services. There is also a growing concern among consumers around data privacy and security, which could lead to increased scrutiny of telecom providers.\nIn response to these challenges, the regional bells and GTE Corp are focused on investing more in cybersecurity and data protection measures, as well as exploring new partnerships and collaborations to create synergies within the industry.\nOverall, the strong demand for telephone services and robust earnings growth for the regional bells and GTE Corp in the third quarter of 2021 bodes well for the industry's future. With the ongoing pandemic and the continued adoption of remote work, the demand for reliable communication services will only continue to increase.

The country has experienced a series of tragedies recently that have highlighted gaps in its space program's safety protocols.\nOn Monday, a launch of the Long March-7A carrier rocket failed due to technical problems, resulting in the loss of the Earth Observation-1 satellite. In March, a partial failure of the Long March-7A resulted in pieces of debris landing on nearby villages.\nIn August of last year, a Long March-3B carrier rocket exploded upon launch, killing several people and forcing the evacuation of nearby residents. These devastating incidents are a serious setback for China's space ambitions.\nIn response, the country is embracing stronger safety measures. The State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense has formed a special team of experts to examine and improve rocket safety, and has said it will revise its safety guidelines.\nAdditionally, the China National Space Administration has announced that it will not launch any rockets until it has thoroughly reviewed its safety procedures to prevent future accidents. This means that all upcoming space missions in China, including those planned for the Chinese Space Station, are likely to be delayed until the review is complete.\nAccording to China's Space News, the safety review will involve more rigorous testing of rocket components, improved procedures for assembling and checking the rockets, and a closer examination of the entire launch process.\nChina's space program has already achieved some impressive milestones, such as being the first country to land a spacecraft on the far side of the moon. However, the recent accidents and delays have underscored the importance of safety in the industry and the need to prioritize it in order to prevent future tragedies.\nThis is a crucial moment for China's space program, and it is taking the right steps to ensure that safety remains the top priority.

The news caused the company\u2019s stock to tumble, as investors became increasingly worried about the firm\u2019s future prospects.\nThe project to build the new fighter jet had been highly anticipated, with a number of major aerospace firms competing for the lucrative contract. McDonnell Douglas, which had partnered with leading defense contractor Lockheed Martin, was widely considered to be one of the frontrunners in the competition.\nHowever, in a shock announcement last week, the Air Force revealed that it had chosen rival company Northrop Grumman to lead the project. The decision came as a surprise to many industry insiders, who had expected a joint venture between McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed Martin to win the contract.\nThe announcement sent shockwaves through the stock market, with McDonnell Douglas\u2019 share price dropping by as much as 15%. Analysts warned that the company could face serious financial difficulties if it failed to secure other major contracts in the near future.\n\u201cThe loss of the fighter jet project is a major blow to McDonnell Douglas, and investors are understandably concerned about the company\u2019s future,\u201d said Matthew Barnes, an aerospace industry analyst at financial firm Bernstein. \u201cThe firm now needs to work hard to secure other lucrative contracts if it is to survive in an increasingly competitive market.\u201d\nMcDonnell Douglas\u2019 CEO, James Blackwood, sought to reassure investors in a statement issued after the news broke. He emphasized that the company remained committed to delivering high-quality products to its customers, and that it was actively pursuing other opportunities in the defense industry.\n\u201cWe are obviously disappointed by the result of the fighter jet bid, but we remain confident in the strength of our business and the quality of our offerings,\u201d Blackwood said. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners to identify new opportunities, and we are confident that we can deliver value to our customers and shareholders in the years ahead.\u201d\nDespite Blackwood\u2019s optimistic message, many experts believe that McDonnell Douglas faces an uphill battle to stay competitive in an industry that is rapidly evolving. The rise of emerging markets such as China and Russia is putting pressure on American firms to innovate and adapt their offerings in order to stay ahead.\nMoreover, the ongoing global pandemic has had a profound impact on the aerospace industry, with many firms struggling to cope with a sharp decline in demand for air travel. McDonnell Douglas\u2019 commercial aviation division has been hit particularly hard by the crisis, with revenues dropping by over 50% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn addition, the company has faced criticism from environmental groups and some lawmakers for its role in producing aircraft that contribute significantly to climate change. With governments around the world increasingly focused on reducing carbon emissions, McDonnell Douglas may need to invest heavily in new technologies and materials in order to stay relevant.\nDespite these challenges, some analysts remain bullish on the long-term prospects for the aerospace industry, and for McDonnell Douglas in particular. The firm has a long history of producing innovative and high-quality aircraft, and it has a strong reputation for reliability and safety.\nMoreover, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing trend towards electric and hybrid aircraft, which are seen as a key part of the future of aviation. McDonnell Douglas has already made some early investments in this area, and it is widely expected to continue to play a leading role in the development of these technologies.\nUltimately, the fate of McDonnell Douglas will depend on a range of factors, including its ability to secure new contracts, adapt to changing market conditions, and invest in new technologies and materials. For now, however, the company\u2019s shareholders will be watching closely to see how it responds to the latest setback, and whether it can bounce back from what has been a highly challenging period for the aerospace industry as a whole.", "Abidjan, Ivory Coast - Donor sources and exporters have reported that revisions to the coffee and cocoa auction system in Ivory Coast are now awaiting approval from the government.\nThe coffee and cocoa sectors are the major contributors to the economy of Ivory Coast, with the country being the world's leading producer of cocoa. The previous auction system for these two commodities, which has been in place for over 50 years, has been criticized for its lack of transparency and efficiency.\nThe proposed revisions, which have been championed by both exporters and donor organizations, aim to address these issues and improve the competitiveness of the industries. The changes include introducing electronic trading platforms, better regulation of the grading process, and increasing access to information for farmers.\nExporters and donor organizations have hailed the proposed changes as a step towards improved efficiency and transparency in the industry.\nAccording to the President of the National Federation of Coffee and Cocoa Exporters of Ivory Coast (FENACOVICI), Karamoko Bamba, the approval of the revisions would be a significant development for the industry. \"This is a great initiative that will not only improve the competitiveness of our exports but will also increase revenues for our farmers,\" he said.\nDespite the broad support for the revisions from industry stakeholders, there have been concerns raised over the potential impacts on smallholder farmers.\nCritics argue that small farmers may be at a disadvantage in the new system, leading to the concentration of market power in the hands of large-scale producers. Some also suggest that the increased access to information for exporters could result in lower prices for farmers.\nIn response to these concerns, the government has stated that it will work to ensure that small farmers are not negatively impacted by the proposed changes.\n\"We are committed to ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account,\" said the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Kobenan Kouassi Adjoumani. \"We will consult with all parties involved to ensure that the new system is fair and equitable for all.\"\nThe revisions to the auction system have been years in the making, with the government seeking to improve the sector's performance in the face of rising competition from other countries. The changes have been supported by donor organizations such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank, which have provided funding for the project.\nThe proposed revisions were initially scheduled to be implemented by the end of 2019, but have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other logistical challenges.\nWhile the revisions have not yet been officially approved, industry stakeholders remain optimistic about their prospects for adoption. \"We are hopeful that the government will see the value in these changes and give their approval soon,\" said Bamba.\nIn the meantime, exporters and farmers are continuing to face challenges in the sector, with the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty leading to reduced demand for coffee and cocoa exports.\nHowever, some have suggested that the proposed revisions could provide a much-needed boost for the industry, particularly in the long term.\n\"If these changes are implemented successfully, it could completely transform the coffee and cocoa sectors in Ivory Coast,\" said one industry expert. \"It could help to position the country as a major player in the global market and contribute significantly to its economic development.\"", "Hong Kong will soon be led by shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, who has been appointed as the Special Administrative Region's first Chief Executive under Chinese rule. Tung's appointment comes as Hong Kong prepares for the handover of its sovereignty from Britain to China on July 1, 1997.\nTung's appointment was announced by China's rubber-stamp legislature, the National People's Congress, which voted overwhelmingly in favor of his selection. Tung, who is known for his close ties to Beijing and his business acumen, was widely expected to be chosen as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive.\nAs Chief Executive, Tung will be responsible for running Hong Kong's government and implementing China's policy towards the region. Tung's main task will be to maintain Hong Kong's stability and economic prosperity, while also ensuring that the region abides by China's laws and regulations.\nTung's appointment has been hailed by many as a step towards stability and continuity for Hong Kong. Tung is seen as a capable and experienced leader who is well-equipped to manage Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule. He is also well-respected in both Hong Kong and China, and is expected to be able to bridge the cultural and political gap between the two regions.\nTung was born in Shanghai in 1937, and moved to Hong Kong with his family in 1948. He is a graduate of the University of Liverpool and has a degree in civil engineering. Tung began his career in the shipping industry, and in 1983 he founded the Orient Overseas Container Line, which is now one of the world's largest container shipping companies.\nTung's success in the shipping industry has made him one of Hong Kong's wealthiest men, and he is a well-known philanthropist who has donated millions of dollars to charity. Tung's reputation for honesty and integrity has also earned him the respect of many in Hong Kong's business community.\nTung's appointment as Chief Executive comes at a crucial time for Hong Kong. The region is facing a number of challenges, including rising political tensions, a struggling economy, and a growing demand for greater democracy and autonomy. Tung will have to navigate these challenges carefully, while also maintaining Hong Kong's close relationship with Beijing and ensuring that the region remains politically and economically stable.\nMany in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement have expressed concern about Tung's appointment, however. They fear that Tung's close ties to Beijing and his lack of experience in government may make him more inclined to side with China on key political issues. They also worry that Tung may be more interested in maintaining Hong Kong's economic prosperity than in protecting its democratic freedoms.\nTung has sought to allay these fears, however, by promising to uphold Hong Kong's autonomy and respect the wishes of its people. He has also stressed his commitment to maintaining Hong Kong's economic prosperity, which he sees as critical to the region's success.\nTung's appointment as Hong Kong's first Chief Executive under Chinese rule marks a significant moment in the region's history. It represents both an opportunity and a challenge for Hong Kong, as the region seeks to navigate the complexities of its relationship with China while also preserving its own identity and values. With Tung at the helm, many in Hong Kong are hopeful that the region will be able to succeed in this difficult balancing act.", "Tokyo\u2019s property market seems to be gaining the attention of Asian investors despite high prices in the past, according to a recent report by Kennedy-Wilson Managing Director, Tetsuro Miyashita. The report suggests an upswing in Tokyo\u2019s property prices and an increased interest in the market from Asian investors.\nAfter years of stagnant economic growth, Tokyo\u2019s property market has started to gain momentum as prices reached a new high following the country\u2019s economic recovery. This has not deterred overseas investors, especially those from Asian countries, who are increasing their investments in Tokyo\u2019s property market with renewed enthusiasm.\nAccording to Miyashita, the biggest draw for the Asian investors is Tokyo\u2019s economic growth and strong population growth. With an estimated population of 13.5 million, Tokyo remains Japan\u2019s most populated city and, as such, is an attractive target for foreign property investors who see it as a potentially profitable investment opportunity.\n\u201cJapan's capital market is benefiting from the strong economy, with rental income expected to continue to rise. This increased interest in Tokyo\u2019s property market has brought about significant changes as well, which is a good thing for the market,\" Miyashita said. \nMiyashita\u2019s report revealed that investors are particularly interested in central districts such as Chuo-ku and Minato-ku, which are known as prime areas for business and commerce. Miyashita also pointed out that one of the reasons why investors are drawn to these regions is due to the high demand for office space in these areas. \nWhile Miyashita acknowledged that the prices of properties in Tokyo\u2019s central districts were steeper than in previous years, he said, \u201cFor investors who have established businesses in Tokyo, investing in these regions still represents good value for money, given the prospects of steady income in rental revenue.\"\nMiyashita suggested that the increased investment in Tokyo\u2019s property market is not limited to well-established businesses and that there has been a surge of investors from developing economies around Asia. In particular, he cited an increase in the number of companies from India and ASEAN nations who are making significant investments in Tokyo\u2019s real estate.\nFurthermore, he said that these investments are not simply limited to commercial property but also extend to residential and holiday properties as well. Miyashita said that property investment is becoming an increasingly popular choice for holiday homes among Asian investors due to the city's rich culture, safe environment, and excellent transportation infrastructure.\nMiyashita added that Tokyo\u2019s property prices are expected to stabilize following the recent positive economic growth. A significant increase in supply, including the construction of several new office buildings and rental apartments in the coming years, would have a moderating effect on prices and potentially make them more attractive to a wider range of investors.\nSuch reports, however, highlight another aspect of Japan\u2019s property market: the issue of aging buildings. According to Miyashita, there are concerns that many investor-owned properties are aging and that the associated costs of repairing and renovating these properties may outweigh the benefits.\nDespite these concerns, the overall outlook for Tokyo's property market remains very positive, according to Miyashita. He said that Japan's strong economic resurgence, coupled with the increased interest from foreign investors, has created a platform for steady growth in Tokyo\u2019s property market for years to come.", "Atlanta-based utility giant Southern Co has announced its acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd, which is based in Hong Kong.

Once the acquisition is completed, Southern Co will have significant opportunities to expand its business and generate long-term value for its stakeholders.\nThrough this acquisition, Southern Co is showing its commitment to growth and innovation, even as the utility industry faces increasing pressures to adapt to a changing energy landscape. As Southern Co sets its sights on a more sustainable and resilient future, the acquisition of Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd is a significant step forward in that direction.", "David Prinosil of Germany has just won the Czech Indoor Open in a dominant fashion. The final match took place on Saturday at the O2 Arena in Prague. Prinosil defeated his opponent, Jan Kodes Jr., in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4. \nThe German player was impressive throughout the tournament, winning all of his matches in straight sets. This included victories over tough opponents such as Andrei Pavel of Romania and Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic. \nPrinosil's performance in the final was particularly impressive. He broke Kodes' serve early in the first set and never looked back, playing aggressive tennis and hitting winners from all over the court. Kodes, the son of former Wimbledon champion Jan Kodes Sr., tried to fight back in the second set, but was ultimately unable to mount a serious challenge against Prinosil's superior play. \nWith this win, Prinosil has collected his fourth career title and continued his impressive run of form in indoor tournaments. He is currently ranked 33rd in the world and is expected to rise in the rankings after this victory. \nAfter the match, Prinosil expressed his delight with the win and thanked the Czech fans for their support throughout the tournament. \"I really enjoyed playing here in Prague,\" he said. \"The crowd was fantastic and it gave me extra motivation on the court. I'm very happy to win this title and I'm excited for the rest of the season.\" \nThe Czech Indoor Open is an ATP tour event that attracts some of the world's best indoor players. This year's tournament featured several top-ranked players, including Prinosil's compatriot Alexander Zverev, who was eliminated in the quarterfinals. The event has been held in Prague since 1994 and is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious indoor tournaments on the tour.", "In a major announcement today, Ford Motor Company revealed some sweeping changes to its senior management team and wider organisational structure. The move, driven by the automaker's CEO, Jim Farley, looks set to bring new energy and focus to Ford as it navigates an increasingly complex and competitive automotive landscape.\nFarley was appointed as CEO last autumn, and has since been vocal about the need for Ford to shake up its approach to product development and customer engagement. Speaking to reporters today, he outlined the key elements of the company's new strategy, which includes a revamped leadership team, a streamlined structure, and a renewed focus on key markets and product segments.\nOne of the most significant changes is the appointment of new senior executives to key positions within Ford. Among them are Lisa Drake, who will take over as Chief Operating Officer for North America, and Kiersten Robinson, who will become the company's new Chief Human Resources Officer. Both appointments are notable for being women in positions of significant influence in a traditionally male-dominated industry.\nThe company's restructuring will also see the creation of three new business units: Commercial Business, which will focus on fleet sales and services; Ford Pro, which will oversee the company's electric vehicles and connected services; and Smart Mobility, which will cover mobility solutions such as ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles. Each of these units will have its own president, who will report directly to Farley.\nAnother significant change is the consolidation of Ford's operations in Europe, where the company has struggled in recent years. The company will now merge its European and South American operations into a single business unit, which will be overseen by Steven Armstrong. This move is aimed at reducing duplication and bureaucracy, and should allow Ford to better compete with European rivals such as Volkswagen and Daimler.\nFinally, Ford will also be consolidating its product development teams around the world, with the aim of improving efficiency and collaboration. The company will create four global product platforms, each of which will be responsible for developing a certain type of vehicle: trucks and SUVs, commercial vehicles, cars, and electric vehicles. Under this new structure, global product teams will report to Hau Thai-Tang, Ford's Chief Product Platform and Operations Officer.\nReaction to the news has been largely positive, with many industry analysts praising Ford's willingness to embrace change and take bold action to remain competitive. Some have also noted the significance of Ford's diversity and inclusion efforts, which have seen a number of women and people of color appointed to key leadership positions.\nHowever, there are also some concerns that the changes may not go far enough, particularly in light of Ford's recent struggles in markets such as Europe and China. It remains to be seen whether the new strategy will be sufficient to turn things around, and how quickly the company will see results.\nOverall, though, today's announcement is a clear indication that Ford is committed to reinventing itself as a leader in the automotive industry. With a new leadership team, a more streamlined organisational structure, and a renewed focus on key product segments and markets, the company looks set to tackle the challenges ahead with renewed energy and confidence.", "Microsoft is broadening its horizons by branching out beyond desktop computers and other conventional devices. The tech giant, well-known for its Windows operating system, is buckling up for a journey through new territories like subway machines and video games, with the intention of bringing Windows capabilities to these platforms.\nIn a bid to remain relevant in a world that is rapidly shifting towards mobile devices and gaming, Microsoft is seeking innovative ways to bring its services closer to consumers. One of the ways that the company is doing this is by partnering with companies like JP Morgan and Xilinx to enable windows to run on their subway machines and other non-desktop devices.\nAdditionally, Microsoft is working closely with industry stakeholders to develop Windows-based video games that have the same capabilities and learning algorithms as desktop computers. By making Windows more accessible across an array of devices, Microsoft aims to create more opportunities for its flagship operating system to remain relevant in an ever-changing technological landscape.\nSome of the most innovative collaborations that Microsoft has been involved in as part of its current push to conquer new territories include the company's partnership with JP Morgan to develop software solutions for digital currency transactions, and its collaboration with Xilinx to bring windows-based accelerated computing to embedded devices.\nSpeaking about the new initiatives, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company was focused on creating innovative solutions that would improve people's lives. \"We are constantly exploring new ways to make our products more accessible and intuitive,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe spokesperson also added that the company was open to working alongside industry stakeholders and partners to develop innovative solutions that would help bring the power of windows technology to a wider range of devices and platforms.\nOverall, Microsoft's recent efforts to explore new territories beyond the desktop could be a reflection of the tech giant's determination to stay ahead of the curve. By collaborating with partners and focusing on innovative solutions, Microsoft hopes to create more opportunities for its windows operating system to remain at the heart of today's connected world.", "Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately, and shareholders are not happy about it. The company has pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges and will pay a $25 million fine. The shareholders are holding their annual meeting soon, and they plan to criticize the board of directors over the company's behavior.\nADM is a food processing company that deals in agricultural commodities such as corn, wheat, and soybean. It is one of the largest companies of its kind in the world, with operations in more than 160 countries. The company's legal troubles began when it was found to have conspired with competitors to fix the price of lysine, an animal feed additive.\nThe price-fixing occurred between 2011 and 2013, and ADM has since admitted guilt. The company will pay the fine to the Department of Justice and will cooperate with investigators. ADM's CEO, Juan Luciano, issued an apology to shareholders, saying \"we take full responsibility for our actions.\"\nDespite the apology, shareholders are not happy with the board's handling of the situation. They believe that the board should have done more to prevent price-fixing and that the company's actions have damaged its reputation. One shareholder, who declined to be named, said \"I believe that the board has failed in its duty to protect the shareholders' interests. The company has lost credibility and reputation because of its actions.\"\nAnother shareholder pointed out that ADM received a lenient sentence compared to others who were convicted of price-fixing. \"ADM got off lightly with a $25 million fine. Other companies, such as Cargill and Tyson Foods, have paid larger fines for similar offenses. The board should have negotiated a better deal.\"\nMany shareholders plan to voice their concerns at the annual meeting, which will take place virtually due to the pandemic. The meeting will be an opportunity for them to express their dissatisfaction with the board's actions and to demand accountability. They may also call for changes to the board's composition or to the company's policies.\nADM has faced other legal challenges in the past, including a 1996 case in which the company pleaded guilty to charges of price-fixing with rivals. The company paid a $100 million fine and promised to reform its practices. However, the recent guilty plea suggests that the reforms may not have been enough.\nThe company has since stated that it will take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. ADM will also implement a compliance program and will train employees on antitrust laws. However, shareholders want to see concrete action, not just promises.\nIn conclusion, ADM's guilty plea to price-fixing charges has caused shareholders to lose confidence in the board's leadership. They plan to express their dissatisfaction at the upcoming annual meeting and demand accountability. The company will need to take decisive action to restore trust and demonstrate that it is committed to fair business practices.", "The British government has blocked bids for the water and sewage utility company, South West Water, opening the door for the creation of a multi-utility company.\nThe decision was made by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng, who cited concerns over \"national security and public safety\" as the main reasons behind the block.\nSouth West Water, which provides water and sewage services to roughly 1.7 million customers in the south-west of the UK, had been put up for sale in November 2020 by its parent company, Pennon Group.\nAccording to reports, two private equity firms, iCON Infrastructure and KKR, had made offers for the company, each believed to be worth around \u00a32.5 billion.\nHowever, the government's decision to block the sale has come as a surprise to many, with some experts suggesting that the move could signal a major shift in the UK's approach to regulating foreign investment in its critical infrastructure.\nThe decision has also led to speculation that the government may now be looking to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies, which would bring together water, gas, and electricity services under one roof.\nSpeaking to the media, Kwarteng said that the government was \"committed to ensuring that our critical infrastructure remains secure and resilient\", adding that \"it is clear that certain foreign actors seek to acquire our critical national infrastructure through hostile takeovers\".\nHe went on to say that \"we will continue to take all necessary steps to protect our national security and ensure that our infrastructure is not vulnerable to foreign interference\".\nThe move has been welcomed by some in the industry as a bold step to protect the country's critical infrastructure. However, others have expressed concerns about the impact that the decision could have on investment in the sector.\nCommenting on the news, Tony Smith, CEO of the Consumer Council for Water, said that \"the water industry is changing rapidly, and we need secure investment to ensure that we have the funds to build the infrastructure of the future\".\nHe went on to say that \"we understand the government's concerns around national security, but we urge them to take a balanced approach that does not deter much-needed investment in the sector\".\nMeanwhile, some experts believe that the decision to block the sale of South West Water could pave the way for the creation of multi-utility companies, which could bring together water, gas, and electricity services under one roof.\nJohn Longworth, CEO of the business group, the Centre for Brexit Policy, said that \"the UK is currently lagging behind other European countries in terms of the integration of different utility services\", adding that \"we need to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies in order to improve efficiency and reduce costs for consumers\".\nThe news comes as the UK government looks to implement a range of measures designed to strengthen its approach to national security and foreign investment in critical infrastructure.\nLast year, the government announced a new National Security and Investment Bill, which gives the government greater powers to review and block foreign investment in critical infrastructure, including water companies.\nUnder the new legislation, any foreign investment in water companies will be subject to mandatory national security screening if the company provides services to more than 50,000 people, or if it is involved in the supply of drinking water or wastewater treatment.\nThe decision to block the sale of South West Water could therefore be seen as a sign of the government's commitment to implementing this new legislation and protecting the country's critical infrastructure.\nOverall, the government's decision to block the sale of South West Water is likely to have far-reaching implications for the water industry and the wider utility sector.\nWhile the move has been welcomed by some as a necessary step to protect the country's critical infrastructure, others have expressed concerns about the impact that the decision could have on investment in the sector.\nHowever, with the government looking to encourage the creation of multi-utility companies, it seems likely that the sector will continue to undergo significant changes in the years ahead.", "Abidjan, Ivory Coast - Ivory Coast cocoa shipments are estimated to reach around 120,000 tonnes by the end of November, an increase of nearly 7% compared to the same period last year. According to the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), the country has exported about 2.001 million tonnes of cocoa beans since the start of the 2020-2021 season, which began in October 2020.\nThe global demand for cocoa has been increasing, which has led to an increase in production and shipments from West African countries like Ivory Coast, which accounts for around a third of the world's cocoa production. This year's cocoa season in Ivory Coast is off to a good start, with reports of favourable weather conditions and high yields in many regions. \nThe chairman of the CCC, Yves Brahima Kon\u00e9, has said that cocoa farmers are doing their best to ensure high-quality production. Speaking about the increase in shipments, he said that it is a testament to the hard work of the country's farmers and to the government's efforts to boost production and improve the livelihoods of farmers.\n\"This increase in exports is a clear indication that the country's cocoa sector is thriving,\" said Kon\u00e9. \"Our farmers have worked hard to produce high-quality cocoa beans that meet the standards of international buyers. The government has also invested heavily in the sector, providing farmers with the necessary support to increase production and improve their income.\"\nHowever, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the sector, with border closures and transport disruptions causing delays and an increase in costs. The CCC has implemented measures to ensure the safety of farmers and workers, including the provision of masks and hand sanitizers, and the implementation of social distancing measures.\nThe demand for cocoa is expected to remain high in the coming years, due to the growing popularity of chocolate and other cocoa-based products. As the world's largest cocoa producer, Ivory Coast is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend and increase its exports.\nThe government of Ivory Coast has set an ambitious target of producing 2 million tonnes of cocoa by 2022. To achieve this goal, it has launched several initiatives to improve the sector, including the construction of new warehouses and the training of farmers in modern farming techniques.\nIn conclusion, the news of an increase in cocoa shipments from Ivory Coast is good news for the country's farmers and the cocoa industry as a whole. Ivory Coast's commitment to increasing production and improving the quality of its cocoa beans will ensure that it remains a key player in the global cocoa market.", "In a move that has raised eyebrows both locally and internationally, the Chinese government has accused veteran dissident Wang Xizhe of illegally crossing the border and pursuing those who helped him do so.\nWang, a well-known figure in the Chinese democracy movement, has been a thorn in the side of the ruling Communist Party for decades. He was last arrested in 2014 for speaking out against government corruption and sentenced to eight years in prison.\nHowever, in December 2020, news emerged that Wang had managed to cross the border into Myanmar, where he had sought the help of local pro-democracy activists. It was reported that he was hoping to make his way to Thailand, where he planned to seek asylum.\nThe Chinese government has since accused Wang of violating its national security laws by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that could be harmful to the state. Chinese authorities have labeled Wang a \"criminal suspect\" and issued an international warrant for his arrest.\nIn a statement released via state media, the Chinese embassy in Myanmar accused Wang of \"breaking Chinese law by leaving the country illegally and engaging in activities that endanger national security.\"\nThe embassy went on to say that Wang had \"colluded with foreign anti-China forces, accepting their support and funding, and stepping up his anti-China activities.\"\nThe statement also included a warning to anyone who had provided support to Wang during his escape from China. Chinese authorities said that they would \"punish severely those who have been colluding with Wang Xizhe and provide relevant information on his whereabouts.\"\nThis latest move by the Chinese government has been criticized by human rights groups and pro-democracy activists, who say that it is just another example of Beijing's crackdown on dissent and freedom of expression.\n\"This is a clear attempt to intimidate those who dare to stand up against the Chinese government and speak the truth,\" said Amnesty International's China researcher, William Nee.\nNee went on to say that it was \"deeply concerning\" that the Chinese government was pursuing those who had helped Wang during his escape from China. \"This is a clear violation of their basic human rights,\" he said.\nThe case has also raised concerns among Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, which has been grappling with its own political crisis since the military coup in February 2021. Many pro-democracy activists in Myanmar fear that the Chinese government will pressure the Myanmar authorities to extradite Wang to China.\nHowever, in a statement, Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had not received any request for extradition from the Chinese government. The ministry went on to say that Myanmar had \"always adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries\" and \"always respects and protects the rights of political asylum seekers in accordance with international law.\"\nFor his part, Wang has remained defiant in the face of the Chinese government's accusations. In a statement released through his lawyer, Wang said that he was \"not afraid\" of the Chinese government and would continue to speak out for democracy and human rights in China.\n\"I believe that the Chinese people deserve freedom, democracy, and human rights,\" he said. \"I will continue to fight for these values until they are achieved.\"", "McDonald\u2019s, one of the world\u2019s largest fast-food chains, has announced a major shakeup in its management team in response to intense competition and declining sales. The company has appointed a new chairman to lead its operations in the United States, which is its biggest market.\nChris Kempczinski has been announced as the new chairman and CEO of McDonald\u2019s USA, replacing Joe Erlinger. Kempczinski joined the company in 2015 and has since served in various roles, including president of McDonald\u2019s USA and executive vice president of strategy, business development, and innovation.\nThe appointment has been made at a time when McDonald\u2019s is facing stiff competition from other fast-food chains like Wendy\u2019s and Burger King. In recent years, these chains have stepped up their efforts to attract younger customers with new menu items and promotional campaigns.\nMcDonald\u2019s has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many of its restaurants to close or operate at reduced capacity. This has resulted in a steep decline in sales and revenue for the company.\nIn a statement announcing the appointment, McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski said the company was committed to improving its performance in the United States. \u201cWe are confident that Chris\u2019s leadership and experience will help us drive growth and improve our customer experience in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\nKempczinski\u2019s appointment comes at a critical time for McDonald\u2019s, as it seeks to regain market share in the United States. The company has been working on a number of initiatives to attract customers, including expanding its menu options and launching new advertising campaigns.\nOne of the key challenges for McDonald\u2019s has been its image as a fast-food chain that offers unhealthy and calorie-laden meals. In recent years, the company has responded to this by launching healthier options, such as salads and fruit cups, and reducing the calorie count of its meals.\nAnother challenge for McDonald\u2019s has been the rising popularity of plant-based and vegan diets. Many customers are now opting for meat-free options, and McDonald\u2019s has responded by introducing its own plant-based burger called the McPlant.\nIn addition to these initiatives, McDonald\u2019s has also been investing heavily in technology to improve its customer experience. The company has launched mobile ordering and delivery services, as well as self-serve kiosks in its restaurants.\nDespite these efforts, McDonald\u2019s has continued to struggle in the United States. In the second quarter of 2021, the company reported a 0.9% decline in U.S. sales compared to the same period in the previous year.\nAnalysts have attributed this decline to several factors, including increased competition, changing consumer tastes, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they remain optimistic about McDonald\u2019s long-term prospects, particularly in international markets.\n\u201cMcDonald\u2019s has a strong brand and loyal customer base, and we believe that the company will continue to succeed over the long term,\u201d said Mary Dillon, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.\nKempczinski will now be tasked with turning around McDonald\u2019s fortunes in the United States. He will oversee more than 14,000 McDonald\u2019s restaurants across the country and will be responsible for developing and implementing new strategies to drive growth.\nIn a statement following his appointment, Kempczinski said he was excited about the opportunities ahead for McDonald\u2019s. \u201cWe have a strong foundation and a talented team, and we are committed to building on that to drive our business forward,\u201d he said.\nThe appointment of Chris Kempczinski as the new chairman of McDonald\u2019s USA reflects the company\u2019s determination to succeed in a challenging and competitive market. With his experience and leadership skills, he is well-placed to steer McDonald\u2019s through these difficult times and position the company for long-term success.", "According to a new study, access to the internet has a positive impact on the learning outcomes of elementary school students. Researchers found that students with internet access at home scored higher on standardized tests and had higher overall GPAs than their counterparts who lacked internet access. The study suggests that internet access gives students greater access to information, educational resources, and support. With remote learning becoming normalized due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings of the study are particularly relevant, highlighting the need for equitable access to internet resources for all students.", "The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) continued its winning streak, scaling another record high on Friday. The exchange's benchmark index, S&P/TSX Composite Index, closed at 21,441.44, up 0.47% on the day. The latest kick was led by interest-sensitive issues and conglomerates that helped lift the market despite a mixed bag of economic data.\nThe Bank of Canada's (BoC) hawkish tone on interest rates was the key driver behind the rally in interest-sensitive stocks. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem confirmed on Thursday that the bank could begin to hike interest rates as early as the second half of 2022 if the economy continues its recovery and inflationary pressures persist. The news sparked a lot of interest among investors, prompting a rush towards companies that are likely to benefit from higher rates.\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RBC), Bank of Montreal (BMO), and TD Bank (TD) finished higher on the TSX, driving the financial sector to be the best-performing group, up 1.07%. The utilities sector also contributed to the broader gains on the index, with Canadian Utilities (CU) and Fortis (FTS) jumping 2.71% and 2.06%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the performance of large-cap conglomerates added to the bullish sentiment. Shares of Brookfield Asset Management (BAM-A) and Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEPC) rose more than 1.50%, while Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Suncor Energy (SU) gained nearly 1.0%.\nThe TSX has returned over 15% so far this year, outpacing its U.S. counterparts, as Canada's economic recovery takes shape amid the pandemic. Friday's gains signal that the market could offer ample opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the country's growth prospects.", "Halifax Building Society, one of the largest mortgage lenders in the United Kingdom, has announced that it will no longer operate as a mutual society, moving instead to become a public limited company. The move is expected to provide the company with greater flexibility to raise capital and invest in new technologies, whilst also protecting it from potential takeover attempts.\nFor several years, Halifax's board has contemplated the decision to convert to a public limited company, with the vote finally landed in favour of the proposal following a successful ballot carried out amongst the company's 360,000 members. Whilst hesitant about the move in the past, Halifax's board members recognised the need to make a change in light of recent industry changes.\nThe transformation means that the Halifax Building Society will complete what has been described as the \u2018last of the great building society conversions\u2019, with the society becoming Britain's first local savings and loan institution to convert into a public limited company. The decision to convert has already been approved by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nFollowing this decision, Halifax will now require approval from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) before completing the transformation. Halifax's chairman, Mark Wrigley, said in a statement, \"We are thrilled that our members have endorsed this important decision. The conversion of the Halifax Building Society into a public limited company will allow the bank to keep pace with the changes taking place within the banking industry whilst being able to continue to offer great value savings and mortgages to our customers. We are confident that our new structure will allow us to remain independent and avoid any future takeover attempts.\"\nThe move follows a wave of closures in recent years from UK building societies. Many smaller mutual societies have suffered as a result of the competitive nature of the mortgage market and the low interest rates imposed by the UK government to help revive the economy. On the other hand, Halifax has fared relatively well, with the company successfully competing with rival lenders for a significant proportion of the UK mortgage market.\nOne of the biggest advantages of becoming a public limited company will be for Halifax to raise new capital from institutional investors, allowing the company to invest in new technology to improve customer experience and secure its competitive position. Halifax's board has also noted that the change will allow the bank to operate in a similar way to other large UK lenders.\nWhilst the move has been largely welcomed, some members have voiced concerns over whether the conversion will leave customers worse off. As a building society, Halifax's owners were its customers, meaning that profits were returned to members through reduced interest rates on their mortgages or better savings rates. After the conversion to a public limited company, there will be a significant increase in shareholders who, some argue, may be more focused on keeping profits for themselves rather than providing the best products and services to customers.\nHowever, Mr Wrigley reassured members that despite the conversion, the bank remains committed to offering excellent products at competitive rates. \"We are proud of our customer service record and are confident that this change will enable us to maintain our commitment to our customers. Our excellent track record of providing good value products and services, coupled with our strong capital base, sets us apart from our competitors and makes us confident in our ability to continue to grow and expand while remaining independent.\"\nThe PRA is set to make a decision on Halifax's conversion in the coming weeks, with the building society set to become a public limited company by the end of the year, following official approval. Once the transformation is complete, Halifax will become one of the UK's largest listed banks and will, in the eyes of many, cement its place as one of the leading mortgage lenders in the country.", "As China attempts to control its HIV epidemic, it has emerged that there are an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people in the country who are currently infected. Despite efforts to raise public awareness and provide treatment, the situation remains bleak and the number of new infections each year continues to rise.\nOne of the main issues is the lack of understanding around the virus and how it is transmitted. While it is thought to be mainly spread through unprotected sex and sharing of needles, many Chinese citizens are unaware of the risks. This is compounded by the fact that HIV is still heavily stigmatized in China, with those infected often shunned by society.\nOne of the ways in which authorities are attempting to tackle the epidemic is through increased testing. In 2019, a record 16 million people were tested for HIV in China, with the goal of identifying cases early and providing access to treatment. However, despite this progress, there are still significant barriers to testing, with many individuals reluctant to come forward.\nAnother issue is the availability of treatment. While antiretroviral therapies (ART) are available in China, they are not always accessible. For those living in rural areas, where the epidemic is particularly acute, access to treatment is limited. Additionally, the high cost of medication means that many cannot afford the treatment they need.\nThe Chinese government has made a commitment to combating the epidemic, but progress has been slow. In 2016, it launched a five-year plan to reduce new infections by 90%, but with just two years left until the plan expires, it is clear that this target will not be met. There are also concerns around government censorship of information related to the epidemic, with some accusing officials of downplaying the severity of the situation. \nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also facing challenges in their efforts to combat the epidemic. Many organizations have been shut down in recent years, with some facing accusations of political subversion. This has led to a severe reduction in the number of organizations working to raise awareness and provide support to those infected.\nDespite these challenges, there are some signs of progress. In August 2021, the government launched a new campaign to combat HIV/AIDS, with the goal of providing free ART to all infected individuals. The campaign is expected to run until 2025 and is part of a broader push to improve access to healthcare across the country.\nUltimately, the struggle to control the HIV epidemic in China will require a multifaceted approach. This will include increased public education around the virus and how it is transmitted, as well as expanded access to testing, treatment, and support services. It will also require cooperation between NGOs, government officials, and the broader public to overcome the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and create a more supportive environment for those living with the virus.\nWith the number of new infections continuing to rise, there is a clear need for urgent action. The health and well-being of millions of Chinese citizens are at stake, and tackling the epidemic will require the efforts of everyone involved.", "Pacific Magazines and Printing Ltd anticipates a significant increase in earnings for the upcoming year as a result of reduced paper prices and rigorous cost-cutting measures. The company, known for its high-quality magazine publications, has struggled in recent years due to the rising costs of raw materials.

The move is aimed at boosting the growth of Nouvelles Frontieres, which started as a small travel agency in the 1960s and has since grown to become one of the largest tour operators in Europe.\nThe acquisition of AOM Airlines is seen as a strategic move for Nouvelles Frontieres, as it will allow the company to offer a wider range of vacation packages to its customers. The acquisition will also give Nouvelles Frontieres access to AOM Airlines' network of flight routes, which includes destinations in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean.\n\"We are excited to announce that we have entered into an agreement to acquire AOM Airlines,\" said Maillot in a statement. \"We believe that this acquisition is an important step in our growth strategy and will allow us to offer our customers even more choice and flexibility when it comes to their travel plans.\"\nAOM Airlines was founded in 1990 and has since struggled to keep up with the competition in the airline industry. The company has faced financial difficulties in recent years, and its passenger numbers have steadily declined.

The firm predicts that the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, will enact policies that will stimulate Hong Kong's economy and drive investment, causing a rise in the index.\nGuinness Flight Asia has added Hong Kong to its list of preferred markets, citing Lam's pro-business stance and her track record of stability and efficiency in government. The firm expects that under Lam's leadership, Hong Kong will become more competitive and attractive to foreign investors, boosting the economy and driving the Hang Seng Index to new heights.\nThe Hang Seng Index is a benchmark index for the Hong Kong stock market, tracking the performance of the largest and most liquid companies listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange. It is widely considered an important indicator of the health of Hong Kong's economy and the overall sentiment of the investment community.\nThe index has been on an upward trend since the beginning of the year, rising more than 14% to a high of 31,391 points in January. However, it has since retreated from its peak and is currently trading at around 28,000 points. Guinness Flight Asia expects Lam's policies to reinvigorate the market and drive the index back towards its peak.\nGuinness Flight Asia's positive outlook on Hong Kong's stock market comes at a time of uncertainty and volatility in the global investment landscape. The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, the Brexit negotiations, and other geopolitical risks have created a challenging environment for investors, but the firm believes that Hong Kong presents a relatively stable and attractive opportunity.\nLam, who took office as Chief Executive of Hong Kong in July 2017, has been taking steps to foster a more business-friendly environment in the city. She has lowered taxes for small businesses, increased funding for innovation and technology, and streamlined regulations to make it easier to do business in Hong Kong.\nGuinness Flight Asia expects that these policies, coupled with Lam's reputation for stability and efficiency, will help to attract more foreign investment to Hong Kong and drive economic growth. The firm believes that this growth will be reflected in the performance of the Hang Seng Index, making it a profitable investment opportunity for those who are able to capitalize on it.\nThe firm's prediction of a rise to 14,000 points represents a 25% increase from the current level, and would require a significant amount of investment inflows into Hong Kong. However, the firm is confident that Lam's leadership and policies will be able to deliver the necessary boost to the economy and the stock market.\nInvestors looking to capitalize on this opportunity can consider investing in funds or individual stocks that are tied to the Hang Seng Index or the Hong Kong stock market. However, they should also be aware of the risks involved in investing in any market, particularly in a volatile global environment, and should always conduct thorough research and seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.\nOverall, the prediction by Guinness Flight Asia of a rise in the Hang Seng Index to 14,000 points under the leadership of Carrie Lam is a positive development for Hong Kong's economy and investment community. It represents a vote of confidence in Lam's policies and leadership, and offers investors an attractive opportunity to capitalize on the expected growth in the market.", "China has recently banned imports of some U.S. chicken meat over avian influenza concerns. This is a major blow to the multi-million dollar export business, which is now at risk. The move comes at a time when China is facing a significant shortage of meat due to the ongoing outbreak of African swine fever, which has killed millions of pigs. The ban could result in a loss of millions of dollars for the U.S. chicken industry and could have significant economic repercussions.\nThe ban applies to meat from a number of U.S. producers, including Tyson Foods and Pilgrim\u2019s Pride. Both companies have a significant presence in the Chinese market and will be heavily impacted by the ban.\nThe ban comes as no surprise, as China has been increasingly concerned about the spread of avian influenza in recent years. In 2013, the country banned imports of U.S. poultry due to outbreaks of the H7N9 strain of avian influenza. While the ban was later lifted, China has continued to monitor the situation closely and has been quick to act when it perceives a threat to public health.\nChina has not specified which strains of avian influenza it is concerned about, but it is known to be highly vigilant about H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8. The country has also been closely monitoring outbreaks of avian influenza in Europe and other parts of the world, which may have influenced its decision to ban some U.S. chicken meat.\nThe ban could have a significant impact on the U.S. chicken industry, which has become increasingly reliant on exports in recent years. In 2018, the U.S. exported over 600,000 tons of chicken meat to China, worth around $1 billion. This accounted for roughly 12% of all U.S. chicken exports and represented a significant revenue stream for the industry.\nWhile the full extent of the ban is not yet clear, it is likely to have a significant impact on U.S. producers. The National Chicken Council has already expressed concern about the ban and has called on the U.S. government to take action to protect the industry.\n\u201cThis ban is deeply concerning for the U.S. chicken industry, which has worked hard to build a strong relationship with China over many years\u201d, said Mike Brown, President of the National Chicken Council. \u201cWe urge the U.S. government to engage with Chinese officials to address any concerns they may have and to work towards a resolution that allows U.S. producers to continue exporting to this important market.\u201d\nThe ban could also have broader economic repercussions, particularly if it leads to a further deterioration in U.S.-China trade relations. The U.S. and China have been engaged in a bitter trade war for over a year, with both countries imposing tariffs on each other\u2019s goods. While negotiations continue, the relationship between the two countries has been strained, and the ban on U.S. chicken meat is unlikely to help matters.\nThe U.S. government has not yet commented on the ban but is likely to be concerned by the potential impact on the U.S. chicken industry. The Trump administration has prioritized increasing U.S. exports in recent years, and the ban on U.S. chicken meat is a setback to this strategy.\nThe U.S. chicken industry will now need to find new markets for its products, which may not be easy given the oversupply of chicken meat in the global market. This could lead to further price pressure on U.S. producers and could cause significant financial hardship for some businesses.\nIn conclusion, the ban on U.S. chicken meat by China is a significant blow to the industry and puts millions of dollars in revenue at risk. The U.S. government and the U.S. chicken industry will need to work together to find a solution to this problem, which could have broader economic implications if it leads to a further deterioration in U.S.-China trade relations.", "The water regulator, Ofwat, has announced that it will review water company price limits in 1999, five years ahead of the schedule. The review will take place after the regulator has received criticism for not doing enough to protect customers from rising bills.\nWater companies are currently required by Ofwat to set prices every five years, which determine the amount customers pay for their services. The last price review was in 2019, with the next review scheduled for 2024.\nHowever, Ofwat has decided to bring forward the review to 1999, following widespread concern over the rising cost of water bills. The regulator believes that the early review will enable it to identify any issues with the current system and make necessary changes to protect customers.\n\"Water is a vital service, and we understand the importance of keeping bills affordable for consumers,\" said Rachel Fletcher, the chief executive of Ofwat. \"That's why we've decided to bring forward the review of price limits, to ensure that customers are getting a fair deal from water companies.\"\nThe announcement has been welcomed by consumer groups and campaigners, who have long called for stronger regulation of the water industry. They argue that water bills have risen too quickly in recent years, putting a strain on already stretched household budgets.\n\"Water bills have become unaffordable for many households, particularly those on low incomes,\" said Tony Bosworth, a spokesperson for Friends of the Earth. \"We welcome Ofwat's decision to bring forward the next price review, and we hope that it will result in a fairer deal for customers.\"\nWater companies have faced increasing scrutiny in recent years over their pricing practices and service levels. In 2018, the regulator fined Thames Water a record \u00a3120m for multiple breaches of its licence conditions, including failing to tackle leaks and maintaining poor customer service.\nOther companies, including Severn Trent and United Utilities, have also been criticised for their handling of customer complaints and their failure to address issues such as leakage and water quality.\nOfwat has said that the early review of price limits will enable it to address these issues and ensure that companies are providing a high-quality service to customers.\n\"We expect water companies to deliver a reliable and resilient service to their customers, and to operate in a sustainable and responsible way,\" said Fletcher. \"The review of price limits will allow us to hold companies to account and make sure that they are meeting these expectations.\"\nThe review of price limits will be carried out over the next year, with the results expected to be announced in 2000. Ofwat has said that it will work closely with water companies and other stakeholders to ensure that the review is fair and transparent.\nThe regulator has also announced its intention to update its methodology for setting price limits, to take account of changing customer needs and expectations. This is seen as a crucial step in ensuring that the water industry remains sustainable and customer-focused in the years ahead.\n\"The water industry faces many challenges, including climate change, population growth, and changing consumer preferences,\" said Fletcher. \"By updating our methodology for setting price limits, we can ensure that water companies are prepared to meet these challenges and provide a reliable and sustainable service to customers.\"", "In the midst of the demerger process, Hanson Companies have received takeover approaches for multiple sectors. The multinational company is currently in the process of splitting its operations into separate entities to increase shareholder value.\nAccording to sources close to Hanson, the takeover approaches have been received for various arms of the company, including the energy, building materials, and chemicals sectors. The approaches have reportedly come from both domestic and international entities, with some offers exceeding the current market value of the respective sectors.\nDespite the interest, Hanson Companies have remained tight-lipped about the potential takeovers. A spokesperson for the company stated, \"We cannot comment on market rumors or speculation.\"\nHowever, analysts have suggested that the takeover offers come as no surprise, given the strength and diversity of Hanson's assets. The company has a significant presence in the global energy market, as well as holdings in various chemicals and building materials companies.\nMoreover, the ongoing demerger process is expected to better highlight the value of these assets, potentially making them more attractive to potential buyers. The move is also expected to give the newly formed companies greater independence and flexibility, allowing them to take advantage of new opportunities more quickly.\nSources say that the Hanson board will carefully consider any takeover offers received, with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. However, the board has also stated that a takeover is not guaranteed, and any decision will depend on a range of factors, including the terms of the offer and the potential impact on the company's long-term prospects.\nThe potential takeover interest comes as Hanson Companies faces increasing competition and a shifting global market. However, the company has a strong track record of adapting to changing conditions and has remained profitable throughout its history.\nOverall, the potential takeover offers are seen as a positive sign for Hanson and its shareholders. With the demerger process underway and strong interest from potential buyers, the company looks set to continue its success story well into the future.", "As the date of the British handover of Hong Kong to China approaches, there are rising concerns over China's plan to march 6,000 troops into the city. The move has sparked fears of potential unrest and a clampdown on civil liberties in the semi-autonomous region.\nHong Kong has been under British rule for over 150 years until the handover of sovereignty to China in 1997. Under the \"one country, two systems\" policy, Hong Kong was granted a high degree of autonomy and freedom not enjoyed in mainland China. However, the agreement expires in 2047, and there have been growing concerns that China is looking to exert greater control over the city before then.\nThe announcement of the troop deployment has alarmed many in Hong Kong, as it suggests a potential military crackdown on dissent. Critics claim that China's recent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in mainland China raises the possibility of a similar scenario playing out in Hong Kong.\n\"We are deeply concerned about the implications of this move,\" said Regina Ip, a prominent pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong. \"This sends a chilling message to anyone who supports the city's autonomy and democracy.\"\nThe Chinese government, however, has denied any wrongdoing and has stressed that the troop deployment is routine, as stipulated in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Officials have also emphasized that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is responsible for defending China's sovereignty, and not for domestic law enforcement in Hong Kong.\n\"The deployment of troops is a sovereign right of China, and this does not affect the high degree of autonomy of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),\" said Zhao Lei, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nDespite these assurances, many are unconvinced. One concern is that the presence of PLA soldiers in Hong Kong could be used as leverage to suppress political dissent in the city. Another concern is that the Chinese government could use the pretext of military intervention to rewrite Hong Kong's Basic Law and undermine the rights and freedoms granted to the city under the \"one country, two systems\" policy.\n\"The march of troops is a worrying development, and we call on the Chinese government to ensure that it respects Hong Kong's autonomy and the rights of its residents,\" said Chris Patten, former British governor of Hong Kong.\nThe British Foreign Office has also expressed its concerns over the troop deployment and has urged China to respect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.\n\"We call on the Chinese government to be transparent about the troop deployment and to respect the principle of one country, two systems,\" said a Foreign Office spokesperson.\nThere are also fears that China's actions could have far-reaching consequences for the global community. If China undermines Hong Kong's autonomy and the \"one country, two systems\" policy, it could send a message to other countries with semi-autonomous regions, such as Taiwan, that China cannot be trusted to respect international laws and agreements.\n\"The international community is watching this situation closely, and we call on China to respect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,\" said a spokesperson for Amnesty International.\nAs tensions continue to rise, many in Hong Kong are bracing themselves for what could be a difficult and uncertain future. While China's actions may be legal under the Basic Law, it remains to be seen whether they will respect the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong citizens as promised under the \"one country, two systems\" policy. Ultimately, the situation in Hong Kong could have far-reaching implications for the region and the world at large.", "REDMOND, WA - Microsoft has officially launched its new MSN Online Service, placing a significant emphasis on the entertainment programming alongside its comprehensive news coverage.

The news has set tongues wagging in insurance circles, with analysts and industry watchers engrossed in trying to predict the outcome of the proposed merger.\nThe insurance sector has been no stranger to merger activity in recent years, as companies look for ways to consolidate and position themselves more competitively in the sector. This proposed merger is seen to be no different, with the new combined entity expected to become a formidable force in the insurance industry.\nSources close to the matter said that Commercial Union and its rival have been in discussions for several weeks, exploring various options for combining their businesses. The negotiations have been ongoing, with the two parties working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that the merger is a success.\nOne of the reasons why this merger is generating so much excitement among industry observers is the expertise that each company brings to the table. Both Commercial Union and its potential merger partner have a wealth of experience in the sector, with each company bringing unique strengths to the proposed deal.\nThe merger is expected to create a company with a diverse range of insurance products and services. Although details of the terms of the merger have not been disclosed, it is thought that the new entity will be in a prime position to compete with other major players in the industry.\nThe news of the potential merger was welcomed by investors, with Commercial Union shares rising by over 20% in early trading. Analysts have pointed out that the increase is a reflection of the market's confidence in the strategic direction of the merger, as well as the financial benefits that could arise from the combination of the two companies.\nThe proposed merger is still subject to regulatory approval, and its success will depend on several factors, including regulatory clearance, shareholder approval, and successful integration of the two companies' operations. However, with the industry expecting the deal to be completed in the coming months, the eyes of the insurance industry are firmly focused on identifying the potential of the merged entity.\nThe proposed merger is also expected to have implications for employees of the two companies. While the details of the merger have not been confirmed, it is expected that there will be significant job losses as the two companies seek to streamline their operations. There have been no official announcements regarding the number of jobs that will be lost in the proposed merger.\nIndustry analysts have also noted that the proposed merger could have wider implications for the insurance sector as a whole. With the emergence of the new merged entity, the industry is likely to face greater competition as other companies seek to position themselves to remain competitive.\nOverall, the news of the potential merger has sent shockwaves through the insurance industry, with the exciting prospect of a new entity emerging, ready to take on the challenges of the future. If the merger is successful, it could herald a new era in the insurance sector, with increased competition, greater innovation, and improved products and services for customers.\nThe eyes of the insurance industry are now firmly focused on seeing the outcome of the proposed merger. While challenges remain, the overall consensus is that the merger represents a positive development for both Commercial Union and its merger partner, and for the insurance industry as a whole. With the benefits promising to be significant, the coming months and years are likely to see exciting developments in the insurance sector as the merged entity takes shape and begins to make its mark on the industry.", "On Wednesday, Chinese dissident and democracy advocate, Chow Hang Tung, was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a Hong Kong court for \"inciting secession\" under the new National Security Law. The verdict has sent shockwaves through the international community and raised concerns about the future of Hong Kong.\nChow, a prominent barrister and former Democratic Party member, was a key figure in the city's pro-democracy movement, advocating for Hong Kong's autonomy and criticizing the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment on the city's freedoms. She was arrested last year on the anniversary of the 2019 anti-government protests and has been in custody ever since.\nHer sentencing was met with outrage and condemnation from human rights organizations and democratic governments around the world. In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, called for Chow's immediate release and expressed concern over the use of the National Security Law to suppress dissent.\n\"Chow Hang Tung's sentencing is a clear example of how the National Security Law is being used to silence dissenting voices and stifle freedom of expression in Hong Kong,\" said Bachelet. \"The law should not be used as a tool to crush peaceful activism and legitimate criticism.\"\nThe National Security Law, which was imposed by China on Hong Kong last year, criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces, with penalties ranging up to life imprisonment. The law has been widely criticized for undermining the city's autonomy and eroding its democratic freedoms, which were guaranteed under the \"one country, two systems\" framework.\nChow's sentencing is a stark reminder of the challenges facing Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and the deteriorating human rights situation in the city. Since the law's introduction, dozens of activists and dissidents have been arrested, with many facing long prison sentences.\nThe verdict also raises concerns about the future of Hong Kong's legal system, which has long been seen as a bastion of judicial independence and the rule of law. The National Security Law allows for cases to be heard by judges appointed by the city's chief executive, who is loyal to Beijing, and may be influenced by political considerations.\nIn a statement, the Hong Kong Bar Association expressed its \"grave concern\" over Chow's sentencing, calling it a \"serious erosion of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.\" The association also called for the release of all individuals detained under the National Security Law and urged the government to uphold the city's legal principles and values.\nThe sentencing of Chow Hang Tung is a troubling sign for the future of Hong Kong's democracy and autonomy. As the city's freedoms continue to be curtailed, the international community must speak out against China's violations of human rights and push for meaningful change in the city. Otherwise, Hong Kong's future looks increasingly uncertain.", "Two of the biggest names in the technology industry are currently battling it out over the future of computing. Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, have differing views on the importance of network computers and the role they will play in the future of computing.\nNetwork computers, also known as thin clients, are devices that rely on cloud computing to operate. Unlike traditional computers that require internal storage and a powerful CPU, network computers depend on servers to store data and process requests. This means that network computers are cheaper and more energy-efficient than traditional computers.\nBill Gates believes that network computers are not a viable option for the future of computing. In his view, network computers are simply too limited to replace traditional computers. Gates believes that traditional computers will continue to be the way people compute in the future because they provide users with more processing power, more storage, and more flexibility.\nGates is not alone in his skepticism of network computers. Many experts believe that network computers will never completely replace traditional computers. While network computers offer certain advantages, they also have significant limitations that make them unsuited for certain tasks. For example, network computers are not ideal for tasks that require a lot of processing power or require users to work without an internet connection.\nHowever, Larry Ellison has a different perspective on the matter. Ellison views network computers as the future of computing and believes that traditional computers will eventually become obsolete. According to Ellison, network computers are more than capable of handling most computing tasks and are much better for the environment.\nEllison has been pushing network computers for years, and his company, Oracle, has been developing network computer technology for decades. Ellison believes that network computers offer a number of advantages over traditional computers, including lower costs, greater security, and improved energy efficiency.\nThe battle between Gates and Ellison over the future of computing has been brewing for years, and it shows no signs of slowing down. While Gates has the advantage of being the co-founder of the largest software company in the world, Ellison has made a name for himself as one of the most innovative and influential people in the technology industry.\nMany experts believe that the debate over network computers is partly a matter of perspective. Those who view network computers as the future of computing see them as the next logical step in the evolution of computing. They believe that network computers will eventually become the dominant form of computing because of their many advantages over traditional computers.\nOn the other hand, those who view traditional computers as the future of computing see network computers as a niche product that will never fully replace traditional computers. They believe that network computers are too limited to replace traditional computers and that they will only be used in certain situations where they are more appropriate.\nThe debate between Gates and Ellison has been heated at times, and both men have made statements that reflect their strongly held beliefs about the future of computing. Gates has claimed that network computers are nothing more than a \"thin veneer\" on top of traditional computers and that they offer no real advantages over traditional computers.\nEllison has called Gates' statements \"short-sighted\" and has argued that network computers offer a number of advantages that traditional computers simply cannot match. He believes that network computers will eventually become the dominant form of computing and that those who cling to traditional computers will be left behind.\nDespite the disagreements between Gates and Ellison over the future of computing, both men have made significant contributions to the technology industry. Gates is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of computing and has helped shape the technology landscape for decades.\nEllison, meanwhile, has been a pioneer in the development of network computer technology and has played a key role in the growth of the cloud computing industry. Both men have had a major impact on the way we use technology, and their contributions will no doubt be remembered for years to come.\nIn the end, the debate over the future of computing is likely to continue for some time. While Gates and Ellison may never agree on the role that network computers will play in the future of computing, their opinions highlight the complex and evolving nature of the technology industry. Whether network computers will eventually replace traditional computers or remain a niche product, there is no doubt that they will continue to shape the way we use technology in the years to come.", "In an interview with a leading business magazine, the CEO of an auto supplier predicted an increase in the number of workers earning less than $10 an hour in the coming years.\nThe CEO, who requested anonymity, cited factors such as automation and globalization for the trend. \"As technology advances and labor costs remain a key consideration, we can expect to see more companies utilize automation to reduce their reliance on human labor,\" the CEO said. \"At the same time, global competition is putting pressure on companies in the United States to cut costs, and one of the easiest ways to do that is by reducing wages.\"\nThe CEO's prediction is not without merit. A recent report by the National Employment Law Project found that low-wage jobs, defined as those paying less than $10.10 an hour, have accounted for 58 percent of the job growth since the end of the recession. Additionally, a separate report by the Economic Policy Institute found that the median hourly wage has increased by just 0.5 percent since 1979, after adjusting for inflation.\nWhile some economists argue that automation will ultimately create more jobs than it eliminates, the CEO believes that the transition could be difficult for some workers. \"There's no question that technology will create new jobs, but at the same time it will displace others,\" the CEO said. \"And for those workers who are displaced, it will be difficult for them to find comparable jobs with comparable wages.\"\nThe CEO went on to suggest that government policies, such as a higher minimum wage and investment in education and training, could help mitigate the impact of automation and globalization on workers. \"We need to ensure that workers are fairly compensated for their labor and have the skills they need to compete in the modern economy,\" the CEO said.\nThe prediction by the CEO highlights the growing concern over income inequality in the United States. While the unemployment rate has fallen to a near-record low of 3.7 percent, many workers remain stuck in low-paying jobs, with little hope of upward mobility. This has fueled demands for higher wages and better working conditions, with some workers even calling for unionization.\nThe CEO's comments were met with criticism from some quarters. \"It's unacceptable for workers to be earning less than $10 an hour in this day and age,\" said Phil Andrews, the director of the Michigan Small Business Association. \"Companies need to recognize that their workers are their most important asset, and they need to treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve.\"\nOthers, however, argued that the CEO's prediction was simply a reflection of economic reality. \"Automation and globalization are trends that are here to stay,\" said John Smith, an economist at the University of Michigan. \"While we need to do what we can to help workers adapt and reskill, we also need to recognize that some jobs will inevitably be lost.\"\nRegardless of one's view on the issue, it's clear that the trend toward low-wage work is likely to continue in the coming years. As companies seek to cut costs and stay competitive, workers will need to adapt to new realities in the workforce. Whether this will ultimately lead to a more equitable and prosperous society remains to be seen.", "Seattle-based technology giant Microsoft has announced its first-quarter earnings report with growth slowing down by 2% since last year. The launch of Windows 95 in August 1995, which garnered positive reviews and blew away most software competitors, has been cited as the major factor leading to a sluggish year-on-year growth.\nThe report, released on Tuesday, revealed that Microsoft declared a net income of $1.7 billion for the first three months of the 1996 fiscal year which ended on 30 September. This represents a yearly growth rate of 39 percent, but a slowdown of 2 percent compared to last year's first quarter. Microsoft's revenue during this period was $3.2 billion, an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year.\nAnalysts say this shows that Microsoft has started to experience difficulty in maintaining its rapid growth over the past couple of years. However, it\u2019s important to note that the first quarter of any year is usually quite slow for most companies, with revenue and profits often picking up slowly in Q2 and Q3.\nAccording to Nadia Adler, a technology analyst at Jupiter Research, the slow growth is a natural outcome of the success of Windows 95. \"They have set such a high baseline, which they cannot maintain at a continued high rate,\u201d said Adler. \u201cThis should be expected following Windows 95\u2019s launch \u2013 it was such a huge success that it impacted sales of other software products that Microsoft competes with.\u201d\nDespite the sluggish growth, Microsoft has many reasons to be satisfied with the first quarter results. The company has continued its symbiotic relationship with personal computers, performing well across nearly all product categories.\nMicrosoft's flagship software product, Office, remained strong with sales up by 29 percent in the first quarter. Additionally, sales of Exchange Server and SQL Server rose significantly contributing to the overall revenue. The company's consumer sales reached $1.8 billion, with Windows 3.X and Microsoft Office continuing to perform well in the market.\nIn the gaming category, Microsoft also performed well with Xbox sales rising steadily. The company launched Xbox in November 2001, and it has continued to compete against rivals Sony and Nintendo in the gaming space.\nHowever, Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser product has experienced some tough competition, with Netscape Navigator holding onto the internet browser market share. Despite this, Microsoft has been busy improving its browser products and continues to compete in this field.\nIn summary, Microsoft\u2019s first-quarter earnings report showed a slower growth rate because of the successful launch of Windows 95 last year. The software giant has many reasons to be satisfied, with its flagship software products performing well across nearly all categories. Microsoft is expected to address these issues and return to growth in the coming quarter. Nevertheless, for now, it\u2019s clear that its long and profitable reign at the top of the software world is under threat.", "Hong Kong's pro-democracy campaigners are fearing for the region's freedom following the imprisonment of a Chinese dissident. Jiang Yefei, a prominent political activist, has been sentenced to 11 years' jail term on the grounds of opposing the Chinese Communist Party's authoritarian rule.\nJiang was charged with subversion after being found guilty of colluding with foreign forces to undermine the Chinese Communist Party's authority. He was arrested in Cambodia in 2019 and later deported to China, where he was imprisoned and subjected to a secret trial without adequate legal representation.\nThe verdict has sparked concerns among activists in Hong Kong, who say it is a warning shot to all those opposing Beijing's power. \"The sentencing of Jiang Yefei is a clear message from the Chinese Communist Party that any act of dissent will not be tolerated,\" said Emily Lau, a former Democratic Party lawmaker in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong rights groups fear that the case could embolden Beijing to take a harsher stance on dissenters, particularly following the national security law imposed on the region last year. Activists say the law aims to silence any opposition to the Communist Party's rule in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong's pro-democracy movement has been on the decline since Beijing implemented the controversial security law, which criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong authorities have used the law to arrest several pro-democracy activists since it came into effect.\nSince the security law was introduced in Hong Kong, many activists have fled the city, fearing prosecution. Jiang, a former journalist, was among several Hong Kong activists who had sought refuge in Cambodia, only to be deported to China.\nActivists have slammed Cambodia's actions in deporting Jiang to China, saying it was a clear violation of international human rights law. \"Cambodia's betrayal of Jiang Yefei sends a message - those fleeing political persecution cannot count on protection in Cambodia,\" said Elaine Pearson, the director of the Asia-Pacific division at Human Rights Watch.\nThe sentencing of Jiang has prompted fresh calls from activists and human rights groups to pressure Beijing to release all political prisoners and stop the persecution of human rights defenders. There are currently more than 600 political prisoners in China, according to the US-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD).\nThe sentencing of Jiang Yefei has put the world on notice that Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms are under threat. It is essential that the international community takes urgent action to stop the persecution of human rights defenders and press for the immediate release of all political prisoners in China.", "Sinochem, one of China's largest state-owned chemical companies, is reportedly considering listing its shares in Singapore as it seeks to become a world-class conglomerate.\nThe move comes as the company aims to expand its operations beyond China and take advantage of the growing demand for its products in Southeast Asia. Sinochem is already a leading supplier of oil, gas, and other chemicals to the region, but its current listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange limits its ability to raise funds and pursue new opportunities.\nAccording to anonymous sources cited by Reuters, Sinochem has been in talks with investment banks and law firms about the potential listing. The company is expected to raise between $1 billion and $2 billion through the sale of new shares, although no firm timeline has been set.\nA successful listing in Singapore would mark a significant milestone for Sinochem, which has been seeking to transform itself into a diversified international firm over the past several years. The company has expanded its presence in a range of sectors, including agriculture, real estate, and finance, and has acquired a number of overseas assets in recent years.\nSinochem's push into new markets has been driven by its desire to stay competitive in an increasingly globalized economy. The company faces stiff competition from other major Chinese firms, as well as international players like ExxonMobil and Shell.\nThe decision to list in Singapore is not without risks, however. The city-state has seen a number of high-profile IPO failures in recent years, including the collapse of oil services company Swiber Holdings in 2016. Investors may also be wary of the ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, which could affect Sinochem's business prospects.\nDespite these challenges, many analysts see Sinochem's move as a positive step towards greater global integration. Singapore is a hub for Southeast Asian business and finance, and a successful IPO would give Sinochem greater access to capital and expertise in the region.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Sinochem declined to comment on the potential listing. However, the company's CEO, Frank Ning, has previously spoken publicly about his ambitions to make Sinochem a \"world-class conglomerate\" by 2020.\nFor now, Sinochem and its advisors are thought to be in the early stages of exploring the IPO. If successful, however, the move would be a major boost for the company's international expansion plans, and could help cement its position as a leading player in the global chemical and energy sectors.", "Toronto, Canada - The third quarter of 2021 has been a challenging period for Canadian base metal miners, who saw their earnings decline due to poor metal prices during the period.\nAccording to a report from the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the country's total mineral production value fell 7.8% year-on-year in the third quarter, primarily due to lower prices for base metals such as copper, nickel, and zinc.\nThe report revealed that copper prices dropped 12% in Q3, while nickel and zinc prices fell 7% and 6%, respectively. The decline in metal prices translated into lower revenues for Canadian mining companies, which struggled to maintain profitability during the quarter.\n\"Deteriorating metal prices have negatively impacted the bottom line for base metal miners in Canada,\" said Pierre Gratton, MAC's President and CEO. \"The sector has been grappling with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade uncertainties, and supply chain disruptions, which have all contributed to the challenging operating environment.\"\nThe poor earnings results have prompted some Canadian mining companies to revise their production forecasts for the remainder of the year. Some have also implemented cost-cutting measures, such as reducing exploration budgets and delaying capital expenditures.\nThe MAC report also highlights the continued decline in exploration activity in the country. It states that exploration expenditure by Canadian mining companies fell by 13% in 2020, and the trend is expected to continue in 2021.\nGratton emphasized the importance of encouraging exploration activity in Canada, given the country's abundant mineral resources. He noted that mining provides critical minerals for the transition to a low-carbon economy and that Canada has a unique opportunity to be a leading supplier of these minerals.\nDespite the challenges facing the sector, Gratton remains optimistic about the future prospects for Canadian mining. \"The long-term outlook for the industry is positive, and we are working collaboratively with governments and other stakeholders to address the issues facing our sector,\" he said.\nThe MAC report also revealed that gold prices remained high in Q3, providing welcome relief to gold miners in the country. However, the report notes that gold is not an entirely insulated commodity, and its price can also be affected by global economic conditions and investor sentiment.", "Prague, Czech Republic- The Czech Republic and Spain clashed in their World Cup qualifying match on Wednesday, with both teams vying for crucial points on the road to Qatar 2022.\nThe game started at a frenzied pace, with both sides eager to take the lead early on. The Czechs had the first chance of the game, but Tomas Soucek's header went just wide of the mark. As the game progressed, it was Spain who seemed to have the upper hand, controlling possession and knocking the ball around in their usual style.\nDespite their dominance, the Spanish struggled to create any clear-cut chances, and the Czech defense stood strong. However, as the half wore on, Spain started to pile on the pressure, and it was only a matter of time before they took the lead.\nIn the 38th minute, it was Alvaro Morata who broke the deadlock, steering a header into the bottom corner from a well-placed cross by Marcos Llorente. The goal could have spurred Spain to greater heights, but the Czechs refused to lay down and fought back valiantly.\nIn the second half, the Czech Republic came out with a renewed sense of urgency and started to push forward in search of an equalizer. Their persistence paid off in the 50th minute, as Antonin Barak latched onto a loose ball in the area and fired home past a sprawling Unai Simon.\nWith the scores level, the game became a tense and tightly contested affair, with both sides trading blows but unable to find a winner. Spain had the lion's share of possession, but the Czechs looked dangerous on the break, creating several chances to snatch a late victory.\nIn the end, however, neither team was able to find the net again, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw. The result was a fair reflection of the action on the pitch, with both sides putting in a solid performance and deserving a share of the spoils.\nFor Spain, the draw was a disappointment, as they had hoped to secure three points to maintain their position at the top of Group B. However, the Czech Republic had other ideas and put in a spirited display to ensure they took something from the game.\nOverall, it was a fiercely contested encounter, with both teams showing their quality and determination. The Czech Republic can be pleased with their efforts, while Spain will be looking to bounce back in their next game against Greece.\nThe battle for World Cup qualification is still wide open, with Spain, Sweden, and the Czech Republic all in with a chance of securing a spot at the tournament. With several games still to play, it promises to be a thrilling and unpredictable race to Qatar.\nThe draw leaves Spain on 8 points from 4 matches, while the Czechs move onto 5 points from their 4 games. The two sides will meet again in November, in what could be a decisive clash in the battle for qualification.\nFor now, though, both teams can take heart from their performances and the point gained from the hard-fought draw. The road to World Cup glory is never easy, but with battles like this one, it promises to be an unforgettable journey for all involved.", "Australian aluminium giant, Comalco Ltd, reported a 72% drop in net profit for the first half of 1996. The company, which had previously projected a healthy profit growth, cited weaker metal prices and a stronger Australian dollar as the key reasons for the significant decline.\nComalco's net profit for the six-month period ending June 30, 1996, was AUD 12.6 million, compared to AUD 45.4 million for the same period in 1995. The company reported revenue of AUD 764.3 million, down from AUD 884.1 million in the previous year.\nThe aluminium industry has been hit hard by a global oversupply of the metal, which has led to depressed prices. Comalco's Chief Executive, Mr. Ian Cockerill, acknowledged that the weaker metal prices had impacted the company's financial performance.\n\"We have seen a further decline in the US dollar aluminium price during the first half, resulting in a challenging market for our primary metal operations,\" Cockerill said.\nThe stronger Australian dollar also played a role in the drop in profits. Comalco, whose output is priced in US dollars, suffered from the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the greenback.\n\"The strength of the Australian dollar has had a significant impact on our earnings, as the majority of our sales are priced in US dollars. This effect has been exacerbated by the weakness in aluminium prices,\" Cockerill said.\nComalco's downstream businesses, which include bauxite mining, alumina refining, and rolled products operations, performed better than its primary metal segment. The company's bauxite division saw increased sales volumes, while its alumina and rolled products segments both returned to profitability after a loss in the previous year.\nDespite the challenging market conditions, Comalco remains optimistic about the future. The company has undergone significant restructure and cost-cutting measures in recent years, which it believes will make it more resilient in the face of market fluctuations.\n\"We remain committed to our strategy of repositioning the company for long-term growth. We are taking action to reduce costs and improve efficiency across our operations,\" Cockerill said.\nComalco has also invested in several growth projects, including an expansion of its alumina refinery in Queensland and the development of a new bauxite mine in Far North Queensland.\n\"We have a strong pipeline of growth projects that will provide increased value over the long-term. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders and improving our competitive position,\" Cockerill added.\nDespite Comalco's disappointing financial results, the company's shares remained relatively stable, indicating that investors still have confidence in the company's long-term prospects.\nComalco is one of Australia's leading producers of aluminium, with operations spanning mining, refining, and smelting. The company, which is majority-owned by global mining giant Rio Tinto, employs approximately 5,400 people and has a significant presence in Australia and New Zealand.", "China is planning to list some of its chemical companies abroad while tightening foreign access to its own chemical market. This move comes as part of China's efforts to increase its presence in the global chemical industry while seeking to protect its own market from foreign competition.\nAccording to industry sources, three state-owned chemical companies are expected to be listed overseas. These companies include Sinopec Chemical, China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec). It is estimated that the listings could raise more than $10 billion.\nBy listing these chemical companies abroad, China is hoping to improve its global market position and increase its share of the global chemical industry. This move also reflects China's ambitions to become a global leader in the chemical industry, a goal it has been pursuing for several years.\nAt the same time, China is also tightening its grip on its own chemical market. In recent years, China has tried to increase its domestic production of chemicals while trying to limit its reliance on imported chemicals. This approach has led to increased scrutiny of foreign chemicals entering the Chinese market.\nAccording to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, companies that want to import chemicals into China will need to obtain a safety certificate from the Chinese government. This certificate will be required for all imported chemicals, including those that are produced in China.\nThe new regulations are part of China's efforts to improve the safety and quality of chemicals entering the Chinese market. However, the move is also seen as part of China's broader strategy to protect its nascent chemical industry from foreign competition.\nThe new regulations are expected to have a significant impact on foreign chemical companies that rely on the Chinese market for sales. According to industry insiders, foreign chemical companies will now face more hurdles when trying to enter the Chinese market, as they will need to comply with stricter safety regulations.\nHowever, some experts warn that the move could backfire, as China's chemical industry still lags behind that of other major players like the US and Europe. By limiting competition, China may hinder the growth of its own chemical industry, which could have negative consequences for the country's overall economic development.\nDespite these concerns, China's plans to list chemical companies abroad while tightening foreign access to its own chemical market reflect its growing ambitions in the global chemical industry. With these moves, China is seeking to establish itself as a major player in the chemical industry while protecting its own market from foreign competition.", "Rite Aid, the national chain of drug stores, has announced its intention to rapidly integrate Thrifty PayLess, the pharmacy chain it recently acquired. The move is designed to attack weaknesses in the company's distribution and technology infrastructures, and drive growth.\nThe acquisition of Thrifty PayLess, which was completed earlier this year, expanded Rite Aid's market share and solidified its position as one of the largest pharmacy chains in the United States. The integration of the two companies brings together more than 4,500 stores and 81,000 employees under the Rite Aid banner.\nWith the acquisition complete, Rite Aid now plans to focus its efforts on streamlining operations and improving efficiencies. Specifically, the company will be working to optimize its distribution network and technology platforms, with the goal of creating a more responsive and agile supply chain.\n\"We're taking a hard look at all aspects of our business to find ways to improve our performance, boost customer satisfaction, and drive growth,\" said Erik Keptner, Rite Aid's Chief Marketing and Merchandising Officer. \"Our focus on technology and distribution is a critical part of that effort.\"\nTo address distribution challenges, Rite Aid is looking to reduce lead times, increase stock availability, and improve on-shelf availability of its products. The company is also exploring ways to leverage its extensive network of stores and pharmacies, using them as fulfillment centers for online orders.\nMeanwhile, Rite Aid's technology initiatives are focused on improving customer experiences and driving operational efficiencies. The company is investing in new POS systems, digital signage, and other in-store technologies that streamline the checkout process and provide customers with more personalized experiences.\n\"We're always looking for ways to make shopping easier and more convenient for our customers, and technology is a key part of that,\" Keptner said.\nTo support its distribution and technology initiatives, Rite Aid is also ramping up its hiring efforts. The company plans to hire more than 5,000 new employees in the coming months, including pharmacists, technicians, and distribution center workers.\nThe integration of Thrifty PayLess is just the latest step in Rite Aid's ongoing transformation journey. Over the past several years, the company has made significant investments in its stores, products, and services, with the goal of becoming a go-to destination for health, wellness, and personal care needs.\n\"We're committed to providing our customers with a fantastic shopping experience, and that means being there for them when and where they need us,\" Keptner said. \"The integration of Thrifty PayLess, along with our ongoing investments in technology and distribution, will help us deliver on that promise.\"", "Global consumer goods giant, Unilever, is expected to release its third-quarter (Q3) financial results later this month. Investors and analysts are anticipating a mixed bag of numbers, as the company navigates the impact of restructuring in North America and sluggish ice cream sales in Europe.\nThe Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, which owns a range of popular brands such as Dove, Lipton, and Ben & Jerry's, has been going through a major transformation in North America. Last year, Unilever announced that it was dividing its operations into two separate headquarters - one in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and another in London, UK. As part of this restructuring, the company moved its North American headquarters from New Jersey to a new location in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\nThe relocation caused some turmoil for Unilever's workforce in North America, with dozens of employees reportedly leaving the company due to the uncertainty and disruption. Despite the challenges, Unilever has remained committed to its strategy of streamlining operations and focusing on key growth markets. The Q3 results are expected to reflect the impact of these changes, with analysts predicting a decline in revenue from North America.\nMeanwhile, Unilever's European businesses have also faced challenges in the Q3 period. The company's ice cream sales in the region have reportedly been weak, due to a combination of cooler weather and changing consumer preferences. Unilever has been grappling with shifting trends in the food and beverage industry, as more consumers opt for healthier and more sustainable options.\nTo address these challenges, Unilever has been investing in new products and expanding its reach in emerging markets such as China and India. In September, the company announced that it had acquired a stake in a Chinese skincare brand called Jinga Life, as part of its broader push into the Asian beauty market. Unilever has also been experimenting with plant-based foods and other sustainable products, such as reusable packaging and refillable cleaning products.\nDespite the headwinds facing Unilever, some analysts remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts said that they expected Unilever to \"continue to generate solid organic sales growth, driven by a strong innovation pipeline and the potential for further portfolio transformation.\"\nUnilever's Q3 results are likely to provide key insights into the company's ongoing transformation and the impact of global economic conditions on its business. The company's shares have fluctuated in recent months, amid concerns about trade tensions and slowing global growth. However, Unilever's strong brand portfolio and its focus on sustainability and innovation could help to insulate it from some of the market turbulence.\nInvestors and analysts will be closely watching Unilever's Q3 report, which is due to be released on October 22. The results could provide a window into the company's future strategy and shed light on its ability to navigate a challenging global economic landscape.", "B.A.T Industries, the British multinational tobacco company, has announced a nine percent profit rise despite facing ongoing litigation in the United States over tobacco-related illnesses. The company cited sales growth in emerging markets and cost-cutting measures as the main drivers behind the positive results.\nDespite the positive news, B.A.T's share price has been volatile in recent months due to the ongoing tobacco litigation in the United States. Several high-profile cases have resulted in multi-billion dollar settlements against tobacco companies, leading to concerns among investors over the potential financial impact on B.A.T.\nIn response, B.A.T has taken several steps to mitigate the risk of litigation, including strengthening its legal team and pushing for regulatory frameworks that could limit the industry's liability. The company has also diversified its product offerings beyond traditional cigarettes, investing in e-cigarettes and other alternative tobacco products.\nB.A.T's positive results come at a challenging time for the tobacco industry as a whole. Globally, smoking rates are declining, and governments are imposing stricter regulations on the industry. However, B.A.T's focus on emerging markets in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East has helped to offset these challenges.\n\"B.A.T continues to demonstrate its resilience in the face of changing market conditions,\" said CEO Jack Bowles in a statement. \"While we recognize the ongoing challenges facing our industry, we are confident in our ability to innovate and adapt to meet evolving consumer demands.\"\nDespite the positive news, some analysts remain cautious about B.A.T's long-term prospects. The ongoing litigation in the United States could continue to weigh on the company's share price, and rising public health concerns about tobacco use could impact demand in emerging markets as well.\nAdditionally, B.A.T's focus on alternative tobacco products like e-cigarettes could face challenges in the form of increasing government scrutiny and health concerns. In the United States, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes in an effort to curb teenage vaping.\nDespite these headwinds, B.A.T remains committed to innovation and growth. The company has pledged to invest up to $1 billion over the next five years in alternative tobacco products, and has set ambitious targets for reducing the environmental impact of its operations.\n\"B.A.T is a company with a long history of adapting to changing consumer preferences and market conditions,\" said Bowles. \"We are confident that we can continue to grow and succeed in the years ahead.\"", "In recent years, Russia has emerged as a major player in the global oil industry. With vast reserves and a highly developed infrastructure, the country has attracted the attention of many international companies looking to invest in this lucrative sector. However, what many foreign investors fail to realize is that in order to succeed in the Russian oil market, it is essential to have close ties to the government and a strong set of negotiating skills.\nThe Russian government controls the majority of the country's oil production through state-owned companies such as Rosneft and Gazprom. This means that any foreign companies wishing to enter the market must be prepared to navigate the country's complex political landscape in order to secure profitable deals.\nOne recent example of this was the 2016 deal between Rosneft and the Indian company, Essar Oil. The agreement, which saw Rosneft take a 49% stake in Essar Oil's Vadinar refinery, was only made possible through the approval of the Russian government. Essar Oil's close relationship with the Russian authorities, as well as its impressive negotiating skills, were crucial factors in securing the deal.\nAnother important factor to consider when entering the Russian oil market is the country's notoriously tough negotiating style. Russian negotiators are known for their no-nonsense approach and their tendency to drive a hard bargain. This can make it difficult for foreign companies to secure favorable deals without an experienced team of negotiators on their side.\nIn 2013, ExxonMobil learned this lesson the hard way when its joint venture with Rosneft was suspended following Western sanctions against Russia. The move was a major blow to ExxonMobil's plans to tap into Russia's vast oil reserves and highlights the importance of having a comprehensive risk management strategy when working in the country.\nDespite these challenges, many foreign investors continue to be drawn to the Russian oil market due to its potential for high profits. One such company is the multinational energy company, Royal Dutch Shell, which has been involved in various joint ventures with Rosneft since 2011.\nShell's CEO, Ben van Beurden, has praised the company's relationship with Rosneft, stating that \"It's a great partnership. We have complementary skills, both organizations bring different things to the table.\" Shell's success in the market is largely due to its ability to navigate the country's complex political landscape and its strong negotiating skills.\nIn addition to having a close relationship with the government and effective negotiating skills, foreign investors looking to enter the Russian oil market must also be aware of the potential risks involved. The country's reputation for corruption and its lack of transparency can make it difficult to operate in a fair and ethical manner.\nFurthermore, Russia's tense relationship with the West and the threat of further sanctions can make it difficult for foreign investors to plan for the future and mitigate potential risks.\nDespite these challenges, however, the Russian oil market remains a major player in the global industry and is likely to continue to attract foreign investment for many years to come. With a strong set of skills and effective risk management strategies, companies can successfully navigate the market and take advantage of its vast potential.\nIn conclusion, the Russian oil market requires a unique set of skills and strategies in order to succeed. With close ties to the government, savvy negotiating skills, and effective risk management strategies, investors can take advantage of the country's vast oil reserves and tap into a highly lucrative market. As the world's energy needs continue to grow, the Russian oil market is likely to remain a major player in the global industry, and those with the necessary skills and experience will be in a strong position to capitalize on this trend.", "Pristine white vessels, complete with sleek lines and advanced technology, were on display at a trade fair near Paris as leading manufacturers in Europe unveiled a new line of \"stealth\" warships.\nThe Shoreham, a powerful vessel built by British firm BAE Systems, drew in curious crowds who had come to witness the unveiling of innovative naval technology. The Shoreham was designed to be invisible to enemy radar, making it difficult to detect and providing a significant advantage in battlefields.\nThe introduction of the new warships marked a new phase in the industry, as shipbuilders turn towards modern technology to outmaneuver competitors and provide reliable, cutting-edge vessels to militaries across the globe.\nThese new designs could be a considerable step forward in the field of military warfare, where air, sea and land superiority is key to maintaining a powerful presence. It could also serve to minimize risks to military personnel and collateral damage to civilians during military combat.\nThe Stealth ships showcased at the fair gained plenty of admirers, with many citing tourism industry growth as a benefit with the improved security guarantee by these warships.\nThe warship, built by a team of over 6,000 specialists, houses a unique plastic coating that absorbs radar waves, effectively rendering the vessel'invisible' against conventional military radar systems.\n\"We believe this will be a game changer in naval warfare, with the ability to provide advanced technology in challenging environments,\" said Niels Lestrade, a BAE Systems spokesman at the trade fair.\nThe Shoreham is not engaging in combat anytime soon, however. The ship was designed for research purposes, with engineers using it to gather data for use in designing future naval vessels.\nThe design of warships is highly sensitive and confidential, with countries keeping their projects resources to them only. However, manufacturers are beginning to go public as they announce their latest ships, hoping to draw attention to their state-of-the-art technological innovations.\n\"The real focus of stealth technology is in the design of the vessel,\" said Hans-J. Thei\u00df, a spokesman for German shipbuilding firm ThyssenKrupp. \"It's a defensive technology, so the design has to be well-crafted in order to minimize detection from enemy radar.\"\nThe firm unveiled the MKS 180, a brand-new warship, which is equipped with advanced detection and communication systems and intended to be the next-generation of the German navy.\nThe MKS 180 could be a significant addition to the German navy, providing the vessel with enhanced sea strength while minimizing risks to personnel.\nFrance-based Naval Group also announced its own new technology, showing off the Sea Blade, a cutting-edge ship designed for high-speed strikes and secret operations.\nThe Sea Blade can attain speeds of up to 100 km/h, and its compact design is optimized for covert missions and undersea exploration.\nThe \"stealth\" warships could provide significant advantages to its owners. The invisibility technology could make a ship's mission more covert, with the target not even knowing that it is under surveillance. The vessels could also increase a fleet's strength, as opponents the \"stealth\" vessels would have a disadvantage.\nThe technology could also significantly reduce the risks to naval personnel, as the ships would be more difficult to target and identify.\nThe rate of innovation in the military sector is increasing every year. Powerful new technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and advanced communications systems are providing manufacturers with new tools to make better ships and equipment. These innovations are also helping military personnel to perform their tasks more efficiently and safely.\n\"Naval technology is constantly evolving, with great innovations in every field, from materials science and engineering to psychology,\" said Matthias Kr\u00fcger, the head of the Defense Industries and Security Department at the German Aerospace Center.\nThe unveiling of the \"stealth\" warships at the trade fair indicates that leading manufacturers in Europe are ready to take on competitors and provide advanced new technologies to their customers. These designs open opportunities for today's navies to protect their coastlines and explore vast oceans with ease.", "Sainbury's, one of the UK\u2019s leading supermarket chains, is set to launch a new banking service in partnership with Bank of Scotland. The joint venture will see Sainsbury's enter the world of banking, providing customers with new financial products.\nThe new banking service, which will be called Sainsbury's Bank plc, will offer savings accounts, credit cards, loans and current accounts. Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland are hoping that the partnership will create a competitive alternative to other high street banks.\nThe joint venture is set to launch in 2020 and will be supported by the full range of resources and expertise from both companies. Sainsbury's will be responsible for driving customer relationships, distribution and marketing, while Bank of Scotland will provide its banking expertise to deliver a range of products.\n\"We are excited about the opportunity to offer our customers a new banking service that will provide them with a great customer experience and better value,\" said Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's. \"Our partnership with Bank of Scotland will give us the expertise and resources we need to deliver this.\"\nSainsbury's already has a successful financial services arm, which has been providing financial products to customers since 1997. The supermarket currently offers a range of financial products, including credit cards, personal loans, savings accounts and life insurance.\nHowever, the company has ambitions to move into full-service banking. This joint venture with Bank of Scotland will enable Sainsbury's to offer a wider range of products and services to its customers.\n\"With Sainsbury's customer base and Bank of Scotland's expertise in banking, this partnership will offer a great opportunity to create a new player in the UK banking industry,\" said Chris Popple, CEO of Bank of Scotland.\nThis move comes at a time when the banking industry in the UK is undergoing significant change. Many new challenger banks have emerged in recent years, offering a range of digital and mobile banking services.\nThe traditional high street banks have also been forced to adapt to changing customer needs and are now offering a range of online and mobile banking services.\nThis is an exciting time for Sainsbury's, which is seeking to diversify its revenue streams beyond their traditional supermarket business. The launch of the new banking service is expected to help Sainsbury's increase its profitability by offering customers more financial products.\nThe new banking service will be available to all Sainsbury's customers, with the aim of attracting new customers and driving customer loyalty. This is expected to be achieved through competitive rates, an easy-to-use digital platform and the convenience of having all banking products available in one place.\nIn conclusion, Sainsbury's is set to launch a new banking service in partnership with Bank of Scotland. The joint venture will see the two companies work together to offer a range of financial products, including savings accounts, credit cards, loans and current accounts. This move is expected to shake up the banking industry in the UK and could create a new player in the market. It is also expected to help Sainsbury's increase its profitability by offering customers more financial products. The launch of Sainsbury's Bank plc is expected to take place in 2020 and is something that many customers will undoubtedly welcome.", "Air France announced today that it is forming a joint venture with Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines.

This will make it easier for passengers to travel between Europe and the United States, as they will have access to a wider range of flights and destinations.\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian said that the new partnership would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the airline industry. \u201cThis is a historic moment for Delta, Air France, and Continental,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are thrilled to be working together to offer our customers more options and better service.\u201d\nContinental CEO Jeff Smisek echoed Bastian\u2019s sentiments, saying that the new partnership would \u201cdeliver great value to our shareholders and customers.\u201d He added that Continental was \u201cproud to be joining forces with two of the world\u2019s leading airlines.\u201d\nDespite the excitement among airline executives, some industry analysts have expressed skepticism about the benefits of the new alliance. \u201cThis is another example of airlines trying to band together to increase their market share,\u201d said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. \u201cHowever, it remains to be seen whether this will actually result in better service and lower prices for consumers.\u201d\nAboulafia pointed out that previous airline alliances have had mixed success, with some leading to increased competition and others leading to higher prices and less choice for consumers. \u201cIt really depends on how these airlines work together and whether they are able to deliver a truly seamless travel experience,\u201d he said.\nDespite the potential pitfalls, the new alliance is expected to be popular among frequent fliers and business travelers. The three airlines have a combined fleet of over 1,500 aircraft, serving more than 370 destinations in more than 70 countries. This will make it easier for passengers to travel between Europe and the United States, as they will have access to a wider range of flights and destinations.\nThe new partnership will also boost the airlines\u2019 revenue, as they will be able to charge premium prices for their services. In addition, the joint venture will allow the airlines to save money by sharing resources and cutting costs.\nThe new alliance is expected to start operating in early 2022, pending regulatory approval. Once it is up and running, the airlines will offer a range of new travel options, including more frequent flights, new routes, and improved customer service.\nAir France, Delta, and Continental will face stiff competition from other airlines, such as British Airways, Lufthansa, and Emirates. However, the new alliance is expected to be a strong contender in the transatlantic market, thanks to its extensive network of flights and destinations.\nOverall, the new partnership is expected to be a win-win for the airlines and their customers. By working together, Air France, Delta, and Continental can offer a better travel experience for passengers and boost their revenue and reputation in the airline industry.", "Several high tech giants have come together to announce the release of a new CD-ReWriteable technology for early 1997. The technology is said to be priced below $1,000, which is expected to make it widely accessible to the public.\nThe CD-ReWriteable technology was unveiled through a joint press conference by Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Phillips. The new technology is expected to revolutionize the market as it allows people to rewrite over CDs, which brings the storage capacity of CDs to a whole new level.\nThe CD-ReWriteable technology has numerous applications, especially in the realm of archiving and data storage. It provides an affordable and efficient method for people to store and save their files, which was once a daunting task, especially when it comes to large files and data.\nThe technology easily outclasses other available options on the market since it can store up to 650 megabytes of data, about 74 minutes of audio, in a single disc, which is more than double what currently available technology can handle. Moreover, since it is rewritable, it can be used repeatedly to store new files and data multiple times, making it a highly economical solution.\nThe new CD-ReWriteable technology is a result of years-long research and development by the three high tech giants. It is based on a technique called phase-change technology, which allows the laser beam to rewrite the data on the disc at varying speeds without compromising the integrity of the data already stored.\nThe technology is expected to have a significant impact on the market, especially for small businesses and individuals who need cost-effective solutions to store their data. It is also speculated that it could lead to the creation of new markets for CD-ROMs as the re-writable feature allows for the storage of dynamic data that is updated regularly.\nMoreover, with the release of the CD-ReWriteable technology, consumers can expect a drop in the price of standard CD-ROMs since the market will be opened up to more economical alternatives.\n\"This is an exciting time for the industry and for all those who need to store and access their data regularly,\" said Koichi Suzuki of Sony. \"This release will allow for the efficient management of files and the creation of new opportunities within the market.\"\nThe CD-ReWriteable technology is a welcome sight for many people as they no longer need to worry about their data being lost or compromised.

Furthermore, the technology could create new business opportunities, especially for small businesses who need to efficiently store their vital information.", "London-based B.A.T Industries is reportedly mulling over restructuring options to streamline its financial services business in the face of mounting regulatory pressure, according to sources. The move comes as the tobacco giant looks for ways to free up capital to boost investment in its core tobacco operations and tackle stiff competition in the sector.\nThe company has hired investment bank Credit Suisse to explore various options under consideration for the business, including a potential sale or joint venture. B.A.T's financial services unit includes life insurance, pensions, and other investment products in its portfolio, which it has been gradually building up over the past few years.\nHowever, the division has struggled to keep pace with the highly regulated market, which has seen many traditional insurers and asset managers contending with tougher capital requirements and lower profitability. The unit has also been hit by increased scrutiny over the sale of complex financial products and the handling of customer complaints, raising concerns about reputational risk.\nB.A.T is looking to restructure its financial services business to reduce its exposure to these issues, while enhancing its ability to offer more innovative and customer-focused products. The company is said to be keen on exploring partnerships with other financial services firms, particularly those with a strong digital presence, to expand its reach and tap into new revenue streams.\nAccording to sources close to the matter, B.A.T is also considering spinning off the financial services unit into a new separate entity, or selling it outright to a buyer willing to take on regulatory burdens. Possible suitors could include private equity firms looking to capitalize on the growing demand for insurance and other financial services in emerging markets, or strategic buyers seeking to diversify their portfolios.\nSome industry observers suggest that B.A.T may have missed the boat in terms of building a strong financial services business organically, given the current climate of tightening regulations and greater competition from new entrants. A more focused strategy that emphasizes collaboration and innovation may be the way forward, they say.\nA reevaluation of B.A.T's financial services business could also have implications for other companies in the tobacco industry, as they too seek to navigate an increasingly challenging landscape. The sector has seen tobacco firms diversify into other areas, such as vaping and e-cigarettes, as part of efforts to offset declining cigarette sales due to anti-smoking campaigns and changing consumer preferences.\nHowever, investments in alternative markets have not always panned out. Philip Morris International, for example, recently announced plans to slash its investment in its \"heat-not-burn\" tobacco products, citing slower-than-expected growth in the market. The move disappointed analysts and investors, who had hoped the company's IQOS device would provide a boost to flagging sales.\nAgainst this backdrop, B.A.T will likely face some challenges in finding the right partner or buyer for its financial services business. Potential bidders may be deterred by the regulatory hurdles involved in running a life insurance or pensions business, as well as ongoing concerns about low profitability and increasing competition.\nTo ensure success, B.A.T will need to balance the need to monetize its financial services assets with that of maintaining a sustainable business model. The company's primary focus remains its tobacco operations, which continue to generate healthy profits despite declining volumes. Any restructuring of the financial services business must, therefore, be carefully considered to avoid undermining the company's overall strategy.\nIn conclusion, B.A.T's move to restructure its financial services business is indicative of the broader challenges facing the tobacco industry as it seeks to adapt to changing market conditions. As regulatory scrutiny continues to mount, companies such as B.A.T must find innovative ways to stay ahead of the curve and keep pace with evolving customer demands. A more collaborative approach to building a sustainable financial services business may offer the best hope for success, but it will require careful management and strategic thinking to deliver the required returns.", "The Czech National Bank has announced the conditions for the government scheme that will see it purchase doubtful debts from smaller banks. The scheme, which was discussed earlier this year, aims to provide relief to smaller banks struggling with a high level of non-performing loans.\nUnder the scheme, the Czech National Bank will purchase loans from smaller banks, providing them with an injection of capital to help them continue operating. The scheme will be limited to loans that are in default and have been written off by the banks. The loans will be purchased at a discount, with the final price determined by an independent valuator.\nIn order to be eligible for the scheme, banks will need to meet certain criteria, including the ability to demonstrate that they have made a reasonable effort to recover the loans themselves. Banks will also need to provide detailed information about the loans they wish to sell, including the value of the debt, the security held against it, and the borrower's credit history.\nThe Czech National Bank has emphasized that the scheme is designed to support smaller banks and promote financial stability in the country. It is not intended to bail out banks that have been irresponsible in lending or managing their portfolios.\nAccording to the Czech National Bank, the scheme will be open to banks with total assets of up to CZK 30 billion (approximately $1.3 billion). While the exact amount of debt that will be purchased is not yet known, the bank estimates that the total could be as high as CZK 150 billion (approximately $6.5 billion).\nThe announcement has been welcomed by smaller banks, which have been struggling to manage their non-performing loan portfolios. Many smaller banks have limited resources and struggle to match the recovery efforts of larger banks.\nThe scheme is also seen as a way to promote competition in the banking sector, which has been dominated by a small number of large players in recent years. By providing support to smaller banks, the Czech National Bank hopes to encourage new entrants into the market and drive down the cost of banking services.\nThe announcement comes at a time when the Czech economy is experiencing a period of sustained growth. Unemployment is low, and wages are rising, which has led to an increase in consumer spending and investment. However, some economists have warned that the high level of non-performing loans in the banking sector could pose a risk to the stability of the financial system.\nIn response to these concerns, the Czech National Bank has been taking steps to reduce the level of non-performing loans in the banking sector. The government scheme to purchase doubtful debts from smaller banks is one such measure, which is designed to complement existing efforts to strengthen bank balance sheets.\nOverall, the announcement of the government scheme has been welcomed as a positive move by the Czech National Bank. By providing support to smaller banks, the bank hopes to promote financial stability and competition in the banking sector. With the Czech economy continuing to perform well, the new scheme is likely to be seen as an important step in maintaining growth and stability in the years ahead.", "Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corp, has announced his plans to use sports broadcasting as a \u201cbattering ram\u201d to dominate the pay television markets globally. The billionaire media mogul intends to use his extensive sports portfolio to drive subscription sales and become the dominant force in the industry.\nMurdoch built his fortune by building a global media empire which included newspapers, television networks, and film studios. In recent years, he has taken an active interest in sports broadcasting, recognizing it as a lucrative tool to drive subscriptions. News Corp now owns a range of assets in the sports broadcasting space, including subscription-based channels such as Sky Sports and ESPN+.\nMurdoch's latest strategy is to bundle sports content with other pay television offerings, such as movies and TV shows, in order to gain an edge over competitors. This approach is not new, as companies like Amazon and Disney have successfully used bundling models to drive up subscription numbers and revenue.\nThe 90-year-old tycoon has always been a fierce competitor in the media industry, and he seems determined to keep it that way. By consolidating his sports broadcasting assets and leveraging their popularity, he aims to outstrip the competition and expand his influence in the fiercely competitive television market.\nMurdoch's statement comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has disrupted the sports broadcasting landscape significantly. With restrictions on live attendance and new protocols in place for media coverage, some broadcasters have struggled to keep up with the challenges.\nHowever, Murdoch sees this as an opportunity to acquire new assets at lower prices. As companies struggle to cope with the pandemic's effects, Murdoch could swoop in and snap up some valuable assets at a discount.\nDespite criticism from analysts and the media about the cost of acquiring sports broadcasting assets, Murdoch seems undeterred. The media mogul remains bullish on the potential for sports to drive engagement and revenue in the pay television market. He has invested heavily in the sector with the hope that his long-term bet will pay off.\nThe strategy seems to be working as News Corp\u2019s sports portfolio has seen a significant increase in popularity. Sky Sports, for instance, has continued to grow in subscribers, and ESPN+ has seen significant growth since its launch in 2018.\nHowever, News Corp isn't alone in its quest to dominate the sports broadcasting space. Disney has also been making significant strides, with its acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2018. Amazon has been building up its sports broadcasting capabilities, too, with its recent acquisition of the rights to broadcast the UEFA Champions League.\nDespite the stiff competition, Murdoch remains confident in his ability to become the dominant player in the industry. He has been known to use his vast resources to enter new markets, and his competitive streak is well established in the media landscape.\nMurdoch's announcement has raised eyebrows and sparked much debate among analysts and other industry players. Some have hailed the move as a bold strategy to expand his media empire, while others have criticized the company for focusing too much on sports. However, Murdoch seems undeterred by such criticism and appears determined to use sports broadcasting as his opportunity to dominate the pay television market worldwide.", "In a race against time, regulators have finalized a multi-billion dollar proposal for universal phone service and internet access. The proposal aims to bridge the digital divide by ensuring that all Americans have access to reliable broadband and phone services, regardless of their location or income.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been working on the proposal for months, with the goal of closing the digital divide in rural areas, where many Americans lack access to broadband and phone services. The proposal comes as more Americans than ever before are working and studying from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the crucial need for reliable internet access.\nThe proposal calls for an investment of $20.4 billion over the next ten years to expand broadband access to millions of Americans in rural areas. This will be accomplished through a new program called the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which will provide funding to internet service providers to build out broadband infrastructure in underserved areas.\nIn addition to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, the proposal includes several other initiatives aimed at expanding access to high-speed internet and phone services. These initiatives include:\n- The Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program, which will provide $285 million in funding to expand broadband access in minority communities across the country.\n- The Precision Agriculture Connectivity Program, which will provide $1 billion in funding to expand broadband access in rural areas to support precision agriculture applications. This will help farmers and ranchers to use digital tools to increase crop yields and improve their bottom line.\n- The Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, which will provide $1 billion in funding to expand broadband access in Indian Country to support economic development, education, and healthcare.\nThe proposal also includes measures to improve the accuracy of broadband access maps, which are used to determine which areas are eligible for funding under the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. The FCC will use new data sources and methods to ensure that these maps accurately reflect the availability of broadband services in every part of the country.\nThe proposal has been welcomed by consumer advocacy groups and internet service providers alike. Consumer advocacy groups have praised the proposal for its focus on expanding access to broadband and phone services for all Americans, while internet service providers have hailed the new funding as a much-needed boost to their efforts to expand their networks into rural areas.\nHowever, some have expressed concern that the proposal does not go far enough to address the root causes of the digital divide. Critics have argued that the proposal focuses too heavily on expanding access to broadband and phone services, while failing to address the high cost of these services for low-income Americans.\nDespite these concerns, the proposal is widely seen as a positive step forward in the effort to bridge the digital divide in America. With more Americans than ever relying on internet and phone services to work, learn, and connect with loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for reliable access to these services has never been more pressing.\nIn a statement announcing the proposal, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai emphasized the importance of closing the digital divide in America. \"Access to broadband and phone services is now a necessity for Americans to work and learn from home, access telehealth services, and stay connected to loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he said. \"Our proposal will help to ensure that all Americans have access to these vital services, regardless of where they live or how much money they make.\"\nThe multi-billion dollar proposal for universal phone service and internet access represents a significant investment in America's future. If approved, it could play a crucial role in bridging the digital divide and ensuring that all Americans have access to the tools they need to thrive in the digital age.", "It's been one year since Microsoft's Windows 95 hit the market with great anticipation and fanfare. The operating system was touted as a game changer, promising to revolutionize the way computer users interacted with their machines.\nBut a year later, it's become clear that Windows 95 has fallen short of those lofty expectations.\nOne of the biggest disappointments has been its stability. Many users have reported frequent crashes, freezes, and other glitches that make it difficult to use the system with any sense of confidence.\n\"It's frustrating to be in the middle of something important, only to have your computer suddenly freeze up and lose all your work,\" says Linda Johnson, a graphic designer who uses Windows 95 on a daily basis. \"I've never had so many problems with an operating system before.\"\nAnother issue has been its speed. While Windows 95 was supposed to be faster and more efficient than its predecessors, it often feels sluggish and unresponsive.\n\"It takes forever to start up, and even simple tasks like opening a program or browsing the web can be painfully slow,\" says Mark Smith, a software developer who has used Windows 95 extensively. \"It's just not as snappy as it should be.\"\nSome users have also criticized Windows 95 for its lack of innovation. While it did introduce several new features, such as the taskbar and the Start menu, many of these were already available in other operating systems, such as Apple's Mac OS.\n\"It's not like they re-invented the wheel or anything,\" says Susan Lee, a freelance writer who has used both Macs and PCs. \"They took some ideas from other systems and put a fresh coat of paint on them, but it's not all that groundbreaking.\"\nDespite these criticisms, Microsoft has defended Windows 95 as a successful product.\n\"We're very proud of what we've accomplished with Windows 95,\" says Steve Ballmer, then-president of Microsoft. \"It's brought computing to a new level of simplicity and accessibility, and we're confident that it will continue to be a valuable tool for years to come.\"\nIndeed, many users still rely on Windows 95 today, either out of necessity or nostalgia. But it's clear that the operating system has not lived up to the hype that surrounded its initial release. And with the rapid pace of technological change, it's likely that Windows 95 will continue to lose ground to newer, more advanced systems in the years to come.\nFor now, though, it remains a reminder of a time when computing was just beginning to enter the mainstream, and when the promise of a better, more connected world seemed within reach.\n\"I remember how excited I was when Windows 95 came out,\" says Johnson. \"It represented a whole new world of possibilities. I guess things didn't turn out quite the way we expected, but it's still a part of our history, for better or worse.\"", "Tabcorp Holdings, one of Australia's largest gambling companies, is hoping for a Melbourne Cup miracle to boost its wagering division turnover.

However, with the Melbourne Cup, one of the biggest horse racing events in Australia, taking place on November 3, Tabcorp is optimistic about a boost in revenue. The company is expecting an influx of bets from across the country, and the potential for a big payout to lucky punters could help to turn their financial fortunes around.", "Trademark experts have initiated a new measure to curb internet address disputes.

We believe that our brands will continue to be loved by consumers no matter what.\"\nDespite her optimism, Brittain warned that the hospitality industry faces a number of challenges, including rising costs and a shortage of labor.\n\"The cost of doing business is going up all the time, with rising rents, rates, utilities and so on,\" she said. \"We are also finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, particularly in London where there is a lot of competition for talent.\"\nTo counter these challenges, Whitbread is looking to automate some of its processes and invest in training and development programs for its employees.\n\"We are constantly looking for ways to improve our efficiency and productivity to keep costs down,\" Brittain said. \"At the same time, we are committed to supporting the growth and development of our people, who are our biggest asset.\"\nAnalysts welcomed Brittain's positive outlook but cautioned that there are still risks to the UK economy, both from Brexit and from global economic uncertainty.\n\"The UK economy is performing well at the moment, but it is still subject to a lot of uncertainties,\" said Paul Hollingsworth, economist at Capital Economics. \"We could see a slowdown in growth if there is a no-deal Brexit or if there is a global recession.\"\nDespite these risks, Brittain remains bullish about the prospects for her business and for the UK economy as a whole.\n\"I believe that Britain still has a lot of potential for growth, particularly in areas like tourism and hospitality,\" she said. \"We have world-class attractions, a vibrant cultural scene and fantastic food and drink. All of these things will continue to draw in visitors and drive economic growth for years to come.\"", "Barrick Gold Corp. has recently completed its $1 billion takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd., securing its position as the third biggest gold producer in the world. The assets acquired will play a significant role in the development of Barrick Gold Corp. given the rich mineral deposits located in South America, which are believed to hold a large amount of untapped gold.\nAccording to the CEO of Barrick Gold Corp., the acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. will boost the company's production goals toward one of its flagship mines, the Veladero mine in Argentina. The mine is known to have vast reserves, and with the acquisition, the company can now continue to expand its exploration program with a view of extending its life span.\nSpeaking on the acquisition, the CEO of Barrick Gold Corp. said, \"This is an essential deal for us as it enables us to speed up our production program and create significant value for our shareholders. The deal is an indication of our commitment to growth and our plan to consolidate our position as the third-largest gold producer in the world.\"\nOne of the significant benefits of the takeover is the blending of Barrick's advanced exploration portfolio, which includes its Veladero and Pascua-Lama mines, and Arequipa's prospective exploration assets. The combination of these assets will lead to significant savings in exploration costs, as well as increased efficiencies in mining operations.\nThe deal also aligns with Barrick's strategy of creating a more significant footprint in South America, where it operates in six countries. The acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. will increase Barrick's gold reserves to 80 million ounces, a significant amount compared to other producers in the industry.\nBarrick Gold Corp. has been on an acquisition spree in recent years as it seeks to expand its operations and consolidate its footprint in the gold mining sector. The company has also been focusing on investing in new technologies as a way to boost efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance environmental protection.\nThe acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. is the latest in a series of bold moves by the company, with many analysts pointing out that the company is looking to dominate the market and stay ahead of competition from rival mining companies.\nDespite the optimism surrounding the acquisition, Barrick Gold Corp. has come under intense scrutiny from activists and environmentalists for its mining practices. Many have accused the company of engaging in destructive mining activities that have resulted in environmental degradation, displacement of indigenous people, and the release of toxic waste into nearby watersheds.\nTo quell these concerns, Barrick Gold Corp. has been working to improve its environmental practices and has set out a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, and restore ecosystems.\nA spokesperson for the company said, \"We take our environmental commitments seriously and are determined to operate in a responsible and sustainable manner. We acknowledge the concerns raised by activists and are committed to working with the communities where we operate to address their concerns.\"\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of Arequipa Resources Ltd. is a significant milestone for Barrick Gold Corp. as the company seeks to consolidate its position as one of the world's largest gold producers. Although the purchase has been controversial, the company appears committed to operating responsibly and sustainably, and this should be welcomed by all stakeholders.", "Building societies in the UK are facing a major setback in their plans to float on the stock market, as draft legislation on takeover protection has thrown their plans into jeopardy. The proposed legislation, which is currently undergoing consultation, could require building societies to give existing members a greater say in any potential takeover attempts, which could make it more difficult for them to go public.\nBuilding societies are mutual organisations that are owned by their members, and which operate as providers of savings accounts and mortgages. They are subject to strict regulatory oversight, but are not listed on the stock market, and are therefore not subject to the same level of disclosure as their listed counterparts. Recently, however, a number of building societies have been exploring the possibility of going public, in order to access capital markets and expand their operations.\nThe proposed takeover protection legislation, which is being developed by the Treasury and the Financial Conduct Authority, would require building societies to seek the approval of their members before any acquisition could take place. This would involve providing members with more information about the potential acquirer and the terms of the proposed deal, and would also require a higher threshold for approval than is currently required.\nThe proposed legislation is designed to protect the interests of members, but has been met with concern by a number of building societies who are considering going public. They argue that the added level of scrutiny and protection could deter potential investors, and make it more difficult to raise capital. They also argue that the legislation is unnecessary, as existing rules already provide for a high level of member protection.\nMany building societies that are considering going public believe that they can offer investors a strong investment opportunity, based on their strong track record of growth and successful operations. They also argue that going public would allow them to access new pools of capital, and enable them to expand their operations more quickly and effectively.\nDespite their concerns over the proposed legislation, many building societies are continuing to explore the possibility of a stock market flotation. They are working with financial advisors and other professionals to assess the feasibility of the move, and to ensure that they are well prepared for any regulatory or legal challenges that may arise.\nSome building societies are also exploring alternative options to going public, including mergers and acquisitions with other mutual organisations. This would allow them to expand their operations and access new pools of capital, without having to undergo the complex and time-consuming process of going public.\nDespite the uncertainty surrounding the proposed legislation, many building societies are optimistic about their future prospects. They believe that they are well-positioned to take advantage of the changing regulatory and market environment, and that they can continue to offer their members strong returns on their savings and investments.\nThe proposed takeover protection legislation is one of a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives that are affecting the UK financial sector. These include the implementation of new regulations relating to capital adequacy and risk management, as well as the ongoing Brexit negotiations, which are set to have a major impact on the UK's financial services industry.\nBuilding societies are a key part of the UK's financial sector, and have played an important role in providing access to savings and mortgages for ordinary consumers. They are facing a challenging period of change and uncertainty, as they navigate the complex regulatory and market environment, and consider new ways of accessing capital and expanding their operations.\nDespite these challenges, however, many building societies are confident in their ability to remain competitive and successful, both in the UK and internationally. They believe that they can continue to provide their members with high-quality financial services, while also pursuing growth and expansion opportunities in new markets and sectors.\nThe proposed takeover protection legislation is just one of many factors that are shaping the future of the UK's building societies. As they continue to evolve and adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements, they will need to remain focused on their core values and mission, in order to ensure their long-term sustainability and success.", "In a move that is expected to create a telecommunications giant, WorldCom, Inc. has announced its purchase of MFS Communications in a $14 billion stock swap. The deal is the largest ever in the telecommunications industry.\nWorldCom is already an established firm in the telecommunications industry and is the second largest long-distance carrier in the United States. MFS Communications, on the other hand, is a young company that has built a reputation for itself in the industry by providing fiber optic network services to businesses and government agencies.\nIn the deal, MFS shareholders will receive 1.3 shares of WorldCom's stock for each share of MFS stock they own. This values MFS shares at $51, a 34% premium over their closing price the day before the announcement.\nBoth companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved the deal, which is still subject to regulatory approval. The companies expect to complete the transaction by the middle of next year.\nIndustry analysts say the acquisition will allow WorldCom to expand its operations in the high-growth business of providing data, video, and voice services to corporate and government customers. With the addition of MFS's impressive fiber optic network, WorldCom will be better positioned to compete with larger rivals such as AT&T and Sprint.\n\"The acquisition of MFS Communications is a major step forward for WorldCom in our quest to become the world's leading provider of advanced telecommunications services,\" said Bernard Ebbers, WorldCom's president and chief executive officer. \"This combination will create a company with unmatched capabilities to serve the growing data and communications needs of businesses and organizations around the world.\"\nAnalysts say the acquisition is part of a larger trend in the telecommunications industry, as carriers seek to expand beyond traditional long-distance services and into the lucrative business of providing high-speed data and Internet services to businesses and other large customers.\n\"This deal represents a significant shift in the industry, as major long-distance carriers move into new markets and compete head-to-head with the Baby Bells and other local phone companies,\" said Michael Bowman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers.\nThe merger also underscores the importance of fiber optic technology in the telecommunications industry. Fiber optic cable is capable of transmitting massive amounts of data, video, and voice signals at extremely high speeds, making it a critical component in the construction of advanced telecommunications networks.\nBy acquiring MFS, WorldCom gains access to an extensive fiber optic network that covers more than 2,000 miles of major U.S. cities and connects to a number of key international cities, including London, Paris, and Frankfurt.\n\"For WorldCom, this acquisition represents a major investment in the future of the telecommunications industry,\" said Ebbers. \"We believe that fiber optic technology will be a critical component in the creation of advanced networks that will serve the needs of businesses and organizations of all sizes around the world.\"\nAnalysts say the acquisition will also be a major boost to MFS, which has faced fierce competition from larger rivals such as AT&T and Sprint in recent years. With WorldCom's extensive resources and experience in the telecommunications industry, MFS will be better positioned to compete in the fast-growing data services market.\n\"MFS has built a reputation as a first-rate provider of advanced telecommunications services, and this deal provides the company with the resources it needs to continue to grow and thrive in the industry,\" said Ebbers.\nOverall, the acquisition is expected to be a major win for both companies, allowing them to better compete in a rapidly changing telecommunications market that is increasingly focused on high-speed data and Internet services.\n\"We're excited about the future of this new, combined company,\" said Ebbers. \"Together, we have the resources, experience, and technology to create the world's leading provider of advanced telecommunications services.\"", "Rumors are churning in the financial world as two potential suitors eye subprime auto lender Olympic Financial. The company, which specializes in providing loans to high-risk borrowers, has caught the attention of private equity firms LVM and Apollo Global Management, raising the possibility of a potential acquisition in the near future.\nSources have reported that LVM, in particular, is showing a keen interest in Olympic Financial, with discussions taking place between the two parties over a possible buyout. While talks are still in the early stages, insiders predict that the private equity firm is looking to expand its portfolio and tap into the lucrative subprime auto lending industry.\nThe potential acquisition has sparked speculation over the future of Olympic Financial and what an acquisition could mean for its customers and investors. Experts have noted that LVM and Apollo, both well-established players in the financial industry, have a proven track record when it comes to acquiring and restructuring companies to maximize their profits.\nHowever, some have raised concerns over the ethics of subprime auto lending, which has come under fire in recent years for preying on vulnerable borrowers with high-interest rates and hidden fees. Critics argue that these types of loans often lead to debt traps for low-income consumers and could exacerbate wealth inequality.\nDespite these concerns, Olympic Financial has continued to post solid results in the subprime lending market, with its revenue growing consistently over the past few years. The company has also restructured its debt and lowered its interest rates in response to investor pressure, highlighting its commitment to responsible lending practices.\nObservers note that the potential acquisition of Olympic Financial could be beneficial for both parties. For LVM and Apollo Global Management, the acquisition could provide a lucrative opportunity to capitalize on the subprime lending market and expand their portfolios. For Olympic Financial, a buyout could provide additional resources and expertise to further improve its operations and provide more access to credit for high-risk borrowers.\nAs the financial industry watches eagerly, it remains to be seen whether talks will result in a successful acquisition for LVM or Apollo Global Management. Regardless of the outcome, Olympic Financial\u2019s story has captured the attention of investors and sparked dialogue over the role of subprime lending in the broader economy.", "Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has announced that it is set to require all fund managers based in the Special Administrative Region to implement so-called \"Chinese walls\" to prevent unsanctioned trades.\nThe measure, which is set to take effect in early 2022, is aimed at preventing insider trading and other market manipulations by ensuring that information about certain trades is only accessible to employees who are authorised to carry out those transactions.\nIn a statement, the SFC said that the new requirements are part of its ongoing efforts to enhance the integrity and resilience of Hong Kong's financial markets.\n\"The SFC is committed to maintaining a fair, transparent and efficient financial marketplace in Hong Kong, and the imposition of Chinese walls is an important step in achieving that goal,\" said Ashley Alder, the SFC's Chief Executive Officer.\nUnder the new regulations, fund managers will be required to erect physical or electronic barriers between employees to prevent them from sharing information about certain trades. The exact scope of the \"Chinese walls\" will depend on the nature of the business and the types of information involved.\nIn addition to requiring fund managers to implement Chinese walls, the SFC also plans to step up its surveillance of trading activities to detect any potential breaches of the new rules. The regulator warned that any fund manager found to be in breach of the regulations could face severe penalties, including fines, suspension of its licence, or criminal prosecution.\nSeveral fund managers have already expressed their support for the new measures, noting that they will help to enhance the integrity of Hong Kong's financial markets and bolster investor confidence in the region.\n\"The implementation of Chinese walls is a welcome development for the industry,\" said Greg Hsu, head of the asset management practice at Baker McKenzie in Hong Kong. \"This is an important step in ensuring that fund managers operate in a transparent and fair manner, and it will help to build trust between investors and the financial sector.\"\nOthers have expressed some concerns about the potential costs and logistical challenges of implementing Chinese walls. Some fund managers have pointed out that erecting physical barriers could be difficult in certain types of office environments, while others have expressed concerns about the impact of increased surveillance on employee morale.\nDespite these concerns, most experts agree that the benefits of the new measures outweigh the potential costs and complications.\n\"Chinese walls have been a common practice in many jurisdictions for many years, and there is no reason why they cannot be implemented effectively in Hong Kong,\" said Maurice Ngai, a partner at Deloitte in Hong Kong. \"While there may be some initial costs and challenges associated with implementing the walls, the long-term benefits in terms of enhanced transparency and investor trust will be significant.\"\nThe move to implement Chinese walls comes as Hong Kong's financial markets are facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. In recent years, concerns have been raised about the risks posed by shadow banking activities, as well as the potential for market manipulation and insider trading.\nIn response to these concerns, the SFC has been working to strengthen Hong Kong's regulatory framework and to boost its enforcement capabilities. In addition to the new requirements for Chinese walls, the regulator has also introduced stricter rules governing the marketing of investment products and the disclosure of information by listed companies.\nOverall, the SFC's efforts seem to be paying off, as Hong Kong's financial markets continue to perform well despite the COVID-19 pandemic and other global challenges. According to recent data, the city's stock market has seen steady growth over the past year, while the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) has also increased significantly.\nLooking forward, the SFC and Hong Kong's financial industry will continue to face significant challenges, including the ongoing impact of the pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and regulatory changes in other jurisdictions. However, with its robust regulatory framework and commitment to transparency and integrity, Hong Kong is well positioned to weather these challenges and emerge as a key player in the global financial landscape.", "Washington D.C. - U.S. Vice-President Al Gore is reportedly planning a potential visit to China next year. According to sources close to the Vice-President, the visit is expected to take place in early 1997, although the exact dates have yet to be confirmed.\nThe visit is seen as an important step in strengthening the relationship between the United States and China.

Gore has long been an advocate for environmental causes, and has been a leading voice in the fight against climate change. China is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the U.S. is keen to engage with China on this issue.\n\"Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges we face today, and it is a challenge that requires international cooperation,\" said the spokesperson. \"The Vice-President will use this visit as an opportunity to have frank and open discussions with Chinese officials on how we can work together to address this issue.\"\nThe visit is expected to be closely watched by the international community, as tensions between the U.S. and China have risen in recent years over a number of issues, including trade policy and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.\nDespite these tensions, the U.S. remains committed to engaging with China, and the Vice-President's visit is seen as an important step in maintaining a positive relationship between the two countries. As one senior U.S. official put it, \"This visit is a sign of the importance that the U.S. places on our relationship with China, and a recognition that we need to work together to address the many challenges we face as a global community.\" \nIn conclusion, Vice-President Al Gore's potential visit to China in 1997 is an important step in strengthening the relationship between the United States and China.

The Vice-President's visit is an important step in maintaining a positive relationship between the two countries.", "Montana billionaire Dennis Washington has rescued Morrison Knudsen Corp from near-insolvency in a move that could revive the fortunes of the century-old construction company.\nWashington, who is known for his interests in shipping, mining, and real estate, has long been an admirer of MK, once one of the biggest construction firms in the United States. The company, which oversaw projects as diverse as the Hoover Dam, the San Francisco Bay Bridge, and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, had lost its way in recent years, with a massive debt burden and a decline in profits.\nLast year, MK narrowly avoided bankruptcy, prompting Washington to step in with a rescue package. In November, his investment firm, Washington Companies, announced that it had acquired a controlling interest in MK, reviving hopes that the company could once again become a major player in the construction industry.\nThe move has been hailed by industry experts, who say that Washington's track record in reviving struggling businesses bodes well for MK's future. \"Dennis Washington has an uncanny ability to spot undervalued companies and turn them around,\" said Carl McKinney, a construction analyst with CBRE. \"He's done it time and time again, and I have no doubt that he can do the same with MK.\"\nWashington himself has been guarded about his plans for the company, saying only that he sees potential in its workforce and its historic legacy. \"MK has a proud history of building some of America's most iconic infrastructure projects,\" he said in a statement. \"We believe there is still room for a company like MK in today's construction market, and we are committed to revitalizing the brand.\"\nIndustry insiders say that Washington may be looking to take advantage of a booming construction market, particularly in the western United States, where many of MK's key projects were located. According to the National Construction Pipeline Report, the value of construction projects in Montana alone grew by 9% in 2019, with many firms struggling to keep up with demand.\nWashington may also be looking to leverage his own connections in the industry. His company, Montana Rail Link, has close ties with the railroad industry, which could be a lucrative source of business for MK. In addition, Washington has long-standing relationships with government officials at the state and federal levels, which could help MK win contracts for public infrastructure projects.\nAll of this could bode well for MK's future, say analysts, but there are still challenges ahead. The construction industry remains highly competitive, and MK must compete with larger firms like Bechtel and Fluor for major contracts. In addition, the company has suffered from a lack of investment in recent years, which has left it lagging behind its rivals in terms of technology and innovation.\nWashington is likely to address these issues head-on, say experts, using his own resources and expertise to improve efficiency and streamline operations. He may also look to invest in new technologies like 3D printing and robotics, which could help MK reduce costs and improve project timelines.\nThe revival of MK is likely to have a positive impact on the wider construction industry, which is grappling with a shortage of skilled workers and rising costs. A stronger MK could attract more young people to the industry, while also providing a more competitive market for clients and other firms.\nFor Washington, the acquisition of MK represents another triumph in a long career marked by shrewd investments and bold business moves. He is already one of the richest men in America, with a net worth of over $7 billion, but his reputation as a savvy investor and entrepreneur only continues to grow.\nWhether he can make MK great again remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Dennis Washington is a man who has a knack for turning troubled companies into success stories. For MK, that could be just what the doctor ordered.", "The U.S. Defence Department has dismissed the Czech Army\u2019s previous claims of detecting chemical agents during the Gulf War as false alarms. A report from the Czech Army in 2017 stated that its chemical detection units had identified and reported the presence of chemical agents in Kuwait and Iraq. However, after conducting its own investigation, the U.S. Defence Department has concluded that these claims were unfounded.\nThe Gulf War was a conflict that took place in 1990-1991, in which a coalition force led by the United States invaded Iraq in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. During this time, there were concerns about the potential use of chemical weapons by Iraq, which was under Saddam Hussein\u2019s leadership at the time.\nAs a result, chemical detection units were deployed by the coalition forces to identify any chemical agents that may have been present in the conflict zone. The Czech Army was one of the countries that contributed to the coalition effort, deploying its own chemical detection units to Kuwait and Iraq.\nThe report from the Czech Army in 2017 claimed that its detection units had identified and reported the presence of several chemical agents, including mustard gas, in various locations in Kuwait and Iraq during the Gulf War. The report also claimed that there was evidence of chemical weapons being used by Iraqi forces against coalition forces.\nHowever, the U.S. Defence Department has now dismissed these claims as false alarms. According to the U.S. Defence Department, there is no evidence to support the Czech Army\u2019s claims of chemical agents being present in the Gulf War conflict zone. The U.S. Defence Department\u2019s investigation found that the Czech Army\u2019s detection equipment may have been faulty, leading to false readings.\nThe Czech Army has acknowledged the U.S. Defence Department\u2019s findings but has defended its actions during the Gulf War. The Czech Army has stated that it was following standard procedures for chemical detection and reporting, and that it was operating in good faith based on the information available at the time.\nThe dismissal of the Czech Army\u2019s claims has raised questions about the reliability and accuracy of chemical detection equipment used during the Gulf War. It also highlights the challenges of identifying and responding to the use of chemical weapons in a conflict zone, where environmental factors and other factors can make accurate detection difficult.\nThe use of chemical weapons has been prohibited under international law since the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which was signed by the majority of countries around the world. The Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by more than 190 countries, prohibits the production, storage, and use of chemical weapons.\nDespite these international agreements, the use of chemical weapons has continued in conflicts around the world. The Syrian civil war, which began in 2011, has seen the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government against its own people, as well as by the Islamic State group.\nThe U.S. Defence Department\u2019s dismissal of the Czech Army\u2019s claims emphasizes the importance of accurate and reliable detection of chemical agents. It also highlights the need for continued efforts to prevent the use of chemical weapons in conflicts around the world.\nThe dismissal of the Czech Army\u2019s claims also raises questions about the credibility of international reports of chemical weapons being used in conflict zones. While it is vital to hold those responsible for chemical weapons attacks accountable, it is also important to ensure that any claims of chemical weapons use are verified through credible and reliable sources.\nIn conclusion, the U.S. Defence Department\u2019s dismissal of the Czech Army\u2019s claims of detecting chemical agents during the Gulf War as false alarms highlights the challenges of identifying and responding to the use of chemical weapons in a conflict zone. It also emphasizes the importance of accurate and reliable detection of chemical agents and the need for continued efforts to prevent the use of chemical weapons in conflicts around the world.", "Shares of Vantive Corp., a leading provider of software solutions for customer relationship management, plummeted by 24% after the company released a statement citing a forecasted slowdown in revenue growth due to a staff shortage. The announcement sparked panic among investors, causing the firm's stock to tumble by over a fifth.\nThe company's CEO, Jane Lee, explained that the growth forecast was lower than anticipated due to the hiring challenges, which had impacted the ability to fill key positions such as software engineers, data scientists, and marketing specialists. The talent shortage had forced the firm to delay product developments and caused increased salary expenses, which, in turn, hurt the bottom line.\nLee said the shift of workplace norms, the pandemic, and a competitive landscape in the technology industry had created significant challenges in attracting and retaining staff. She emphasized that the company was committed to addressing these challenges, including new recruitment strategies and increased investment in employee retention and upskilling programs.\nThe revenue setback has prompted a series of reactions from analysts and investors alike, with some describing it as a warning sign for the tech industry. Many saw the announcement as an opportunity to question the resilience of the industry, with some concerns being expressed over the industry's ability to keep up with the pace of development.\nOthers, meanwhile, have lauded the company's transparency in being open about the challenges it perceives, including the staff shortage, which has been a problem for many businesses, and their plans to address them. They say the firm's proactive approach is an example that other companies can follow, given that the talent shortage had become a significant concern worldwide.\nDespite the revenue slowdown, the company said it had secured several key new contracts, including a substantial deal with a major retailer. The company also confirmed that there were plans to explore opportunities for new acquisitions over the next financial period, with the aim of expanding its presence in new markets and increasing its revenue stream.\nThe company's stock price drop has highlighted the challenges that companies face in keeping up with technological advancements and the need for skilled staff. Many companies are struggling to find the right candidates who possess the skills required to maintain and develop the technology that drives customer relations and business growth. Vantive's decision to address its challenges transparently may benefit not only the company itself but also the wider industry, ultimately leading to a collective effort to address the current shortage.", "Dominion Resources, one of the largest electricity and natural gas producers in the United States, has held preliminary discussions with East Midlands Electricity (EME) over a potential takeover bid. While both companies declined to comment on the talks, sources familiar with the matter suggest that Dominion is interested in acquiring EME to expand its operations in the United Kingdom.\nEME, which operates in the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire, supplies electricity to over two million customers and has a market value of around \u00a32 billion. The company is owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate Cheung Kong Group, which acquired it in 2011. Cheung Kong has not announced any plans to sell EME but is said to be considering various strategic options.\nDominion Resources, based in Richmond, Virginia, has a market capitalization of over $60 billion and operates in 18 states. The company generates and distributes electricity and natural gas, as well as operates gas pipelines and storage facilities. Dominion has been seeking to expand its overseas operations and has already acquired a stake in a liquefied natural gas plant in Maryland and is building a gas-fired power plant in South Korea.\nIf Dominion proceeds with a takeover bid for EME, it would mark the company's first major acquisition in Europe. The move would also give Dominion access to the UK's electricity market and increase its presence in the renewable energy sector. EME has invested heavily in wind and solar power in recent years, and renewable sources now account for over one-third of its electricity production. Meanwhile, Dominion has set a goal to produce 7,700 megawatts of renewable energy by 2025, up from 2,300 megawatts currently.\nHowever, any potential acquisition by Dominion would require approval from UK regulators, including the Competition and Markets Authority. The regulator has recently been scrutinizing the electricity market, with a particular focus on the dominance of the \"Big Six\" energy suppliers, which include EME. The regulator has also been considering ways to encourage new entrants into the market and promote competition.\nEME has faced criticism from some customers and politicians for charging high prices and failing to offer competitive tariffs. Last year, the company announced plans to reduce its standard variable tariff by 5% after a review by the regulator found that it had overcharged customers. EME has also faced pressure to invest in upgrading its infrastructure and improving its customer service.\nDespite these challenges, EME remains a significant player in the UK electricity market and has a strong customer base in the East Midlands region. If Dominion acquires EME, it would face competition from other major energy suppliers such as British Gas, EDF Energy, and NPower.\nThe talks between Dominion and EME are still in their early stages, and it is unclear if a deal will be reached. However, the discussions indicate that Dominion is serious about expanding its operations overseas and sees the UK market as a strategic opportunity. If a deal is completed, it would be the latest in a string of mergers and acquisitions in the energy sector, as companies seek to consolidate their positions and adapt to the changing demands of the industry.", "Greenway Partners has announced that it has purchased an 8.5% stake in Outboard Marine Corp (OMC) for nearly $30 million, in a move that is expected to strengthen the company's position in the marine industry.\nOMC, a leading manufacturer of outboard engines and boats, has been struggling in recent years due to increasing competition from other players in the market. However, the company has been making efforts to turn things around by investing in new technology and expanding its product line.\nGreenway Partners, a private equity firm with a focus on sustainable investments, is hoping to capitalize on OMC's efforts and help accelerate its growth. The firm has a long history of investing in companies that are committed to protecting the environment, and it sees OMC as an ideal partner in this mission.\n\"OMC has a great reputation in the industry for quality and innovation,\" said Mark Williams, CEO of Greenway Partners. \"We believe that by working together, we can help the company continue to grow while also ensuring that it remains a leader in sustainable practices.\"\nThe deal comes at a crucial time for OMC, which has been facing increased pressure from environmental advocates to reduce its carbon footprint. The company has responded by investing in new technologies that are designed to minimize emissions, such as its new Evinrude E-TEC G2 engine.\n\"We understand that our customers are concerned about the impact of boating on the environment,\" said OMC CEO Jeff Wasil. \"That's why we're committed to taking a leadership role in developing technologies that are both eco-friendly and efficient.\"\nGreenway Partners has been an advocate for sustainable investing since its founding in 2005. The firm has invested in a range of companies that are committed to reducing their environmental footprint, including renewable energy providers, waste management firms, and sustainable agriculture companies.\n\"We believe that sustainable investing is not only good for the planet, but also good for business,\" said Williams. \"By investing in companies that are committed to protecting the environment, we're not only doing our part to create a more sustainable future, but we're also helping to create value for our investors.\"\nThe deal between Greenway Partners and OMC is expected to help both companies achieve their goals. OMC will benefit from the added investment and expertise provided by Greenway Partners, while Greenway Partners will gain a valuable stake in a company that is committed to sustainability.\n\"We're excited to be working with a company that shares our values and is committed to making a positive impact on the world,\" said Williams. \"We believe that together, we can help OMC continue to grow and thrive in a sustainable and responsible way.\"", "Transneft Demands a Stronger Role in Proposed New Pipeline Project\nRussia's top oil exporter Transneft has demanded a stronger role in the construction of a new pipeline that will link Russia and China. The new pipeline will transport Russian oil from the East Siberian fields to China's Heilongjiang Province. The project is aimed at boosting Russia's oil exports to China, a rapidly growing market with vast energy demands. However, Transneft is demanding a more significant role in the project given its extensive experience in pipeline construction and its crucial role in Russia's oil industry.\nTransneft is the monopoly operator of Russia's oil and petroleum product pipeline system. The company has vast experience in the design, construction, and operation of oil and gas pipelines, with an extensive network that spans the entire country. It is also responsible for the storage, transport, and marketing of crude oil and petroleum products within Russia and abroad.\nThe new pipeline project is estimated to cost approximately $6 billion and will transport up to 50 million tonnes of oil per year to China. It is expected to be completed by 2025 and will be part of Russia's efforts to diversify its energy exports away from Europe and towards Asia. The new pipeline will also reduce Russia's dependence on transit countries such as Ukraine and Belarus, which have been fraught with political tension in recent years.\nTransneft has been vocal about its desire to play a more significant role in the construction and operation of the new pipeline project. It has argued that it has the necessary expertise and experience to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards. The company is also concerned that it may be sidelined in favor of other state-owned companies, such as Rosneft or Gazprom, which have been increasingly active in the oil and gas sector.\nTransneft's CEO, Nikolai Tokarev, has stated that the company is willing to take on a more significant role in the new pipeline project, including the design, construction, and operation of the pipeline. He has also suggested that Transneft should have a say in the selection of contractors and suppliers to ensure that the project is completed to the required standards.\nHowever, some experts have raised concerns that Transneft may be seeking to monopolize the new pipeline project. They argue that the company already has a virtual monopoly on Russia's oil pipeline system and that giving it a dominant role in the new project could lead to higher costs and reduced competition. They have also pointed out that Transneft has been implicated in several corruption scandals over the years, which could undermine the project's integrity.\nDespite these concerns, it is clear that Transneft will play a critical role in the new pipeline project. The company's extensive experience in pipeline construction and its established network will be crucial in ensuring that the project is completed on time and to the required standards. The company also has the necessary expertise to ensure that the pipeline is operated safely and securely and can transport the required volumes of oil to China.\nThe new pipeline project is a crucial part of Russia's efforts to diversify its energy exports and reduce its dependence on European markets. It will also strengthen Russia's energy ties with China, a vital strategic partner and economic ally. However, to ensure the project's success, it will be essential to involve all stakeholders and ensure that the project is completed transparently and efficiently.\nIn conclusion, Transneft's demand for a stronger role in the new pipeline project is not surprising given the company's extensive experience in pipeline construction and its crucial role in Russia's oil industry. However, it will be crucial to ensure that the company's involvement does not lead to monopolization or undermine the project's integrity. Ultimately, all stakeholders must work together to ensure that the new pipeline project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards, delivering the benefits to Russia and China and the global economy.", "Detroit Mayor, Mike Duggan, announced the exciting news that the construction of a new downtown stadium complex has taken a significant step forward.

The bank has launched an investigation into the matter and is working closely with law enforcement officials to help identify the culprits responsible for the loss.\nAccording to the bank's internal investigation, a group of employees working in the bank's trading department may have been involved in some sort of fraudulent activity that resulted in the significant loss.

The bank has already implemented a series of enhanced internal controls and security measures to prevent future incidents of this kind.\nIn the wake of the incident, Mizuho Bank has also announced plans to conduct a full review of all of its internal procedures and policies, with a focus on identifying any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by dishonest employees. The bank has stated that it is committed to ensuring the highest standards of integrity and transparency in all of its operations and will take all necessary actions to prevent any further incidents of this kind.\nFor its customers and stakeholders, the situation is a reminder of the importance of due diligence and oversight when it comes to financial investments and transactions. While the bank has pledged to work to restore customer confidence in the wake of the incident, it is clear that the road ahead will not be easy, and that there will be many challenges to overcome.\nConcerns about the impact of the incident on the wider Japanese economy remain. But for now, Mizuho Bank is focused on identifying and addressing the root causes of the problem and ensuring that it can move forward with a renewed sense of purpose and commitment to the highest standards of financial integrity.", "Toronto, Canada - Barrick Gold, one of the world's largest gold mining companies, has recently boosted the Toronto market to a record-breaking high with its negotiations for a lucrative gold deposit in Indonesia. The deal, if successful, could see the company's share price skyrocket and become a major player in the global gold market.\nAccording to reports, Barrick Gold has been in talks with the Indonesian government for a deposit in Grasberg, a major mining hub and home to one of the world's largest copper and gold mines. Negotiations have been ongoing for months, with both parties keen to finalize a deal that could benefit Indonesia's economy and bolster Barrick Gold's portfolio.\nBarrick Gold's CEO, Mark Bristow, has expressed optimism about the potential acquisition, saying that \"Grasberg represents a unique opportunity for Barrick to expand its operations in one of the most important mining regions in the world.\"\nThe news of the negotiations has sent Barrick Gold's shares soaring, with analysts predicting that the company could even surpass its previous market records. The Toronto Stock Exchange has also responded positively, breaking its own records as investors flock to buy into the promising deal.\nIndonesia's government has been seeking to attract foreign investment into its mining sector for some time, and Grasberg has long been a key target for companies like Barrick Gold. The negotiations mark a significant step forward in the country's efforts to boost its economy and create new opportunities for its citizens.\nHowever, the deal is not without its challenges. The Indonesian government has been vocal about its desire to increase its share in mining operations, and Barrick Gold will likely need to negotiate favorable terms in order to secure the deposit. Additionally, Grasberg has a complex ownership structure, with several parties involved, which could complicate negotiations.\nDespite these hurdles, both Barrick Gold and the Indonesian government remain committed to reaching a deal. The potential benefits are clear, with Barrick Gold positioned to become a major player in the global gold market while Indonesia stands to gain increased foreign investment and economic growth.\nAs negotiations continue, all eyes will be on the results, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating the outcome of one of the most significant mining deals in recent memory.", "AT&T Corp., one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the world, is reportedly on the verge of announcing a surprise successor to the current Chairman and CEO, Randall Stephenson, according to an inside source. The move comes as a shock to shareholders and industry experts, who are eager to hear who will lead the company into the future.\nAlthough the official announcement has not yet been made, the source suggested that the name of the new Chairman and CEO could be revealed as early as next week. The new leader is said to have been carefully selected by Stephenson and the AT&T board of directors, who have been working closely to ensure a smooth transition.\nThe sudden change in leadership comes at a time when the company faces a number of challenges, including increasing competition from rivals like Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as the ongoing rollout of 5G technology. Shareholders will be watching closely to see how the new leader will tackle these issues and keep the company on track for long-term success.\nSome experts have speculated that the new Chairman and CEO could be an insider, with several high-level executives already considered as potential candidates. However, others believe that a fresh perspective and new direction could be just what the company needs to stay ahead of the curve.\nAT&T has a long history of innovation and has been at the forefront of many of the latest trends in technology. From the introduction of the first commercial mobile telephone in 1947 to the development of the first 3G network in the 1990s, the company has always been a leader in the telecommunications industry.\nIn recent years, the company has focused on diversifying its business, expanding into areas like entertainment through the acquisition of Time Warner in 2018. The move was meant to help the company compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, but integrating the two businesses has proven to be challenging.\nThe new Chairman and CEO will need to have a strong track record of leadership and innovation to navigate these challenges and continue the company's legacy of success. The news of the surprise successor has already generated considerable buzz in the industry, with investors and analysts eagerly anticipating the announcement.\nAT&T has not yet commented on the rumors surrounding the new CEO, but many are hopeful that the announcement will signal a new chapter of growth and prosperity for the telecommunications giant. With competition in the industry fiercer than ever before, the company will need to stay ahead of the curve if it hopes to maintain its position as a global leader in the years to come.", "China's B Shares surged on Monday amid rumors that the Chinese government is planning support measures. This news has come as a sigh of relief for investors who were worried about the country's economy. B shares, a category of stocks that are available for foreign investors, jumped 7.7%, marking the largest one-day gain in more than two years.\nThere has been growing concern about the country's economy, as trade tensions with the US, an aging population, and a slowing economy are putting pressure on China's leadership. To mitigate these concerns, the government has been exploring ways to stabilize the economy and boost investor confidence. The Chinese central bank has already cut interest rates and eased reserve requirements for banks.\nAccording to rumors, the government is planning to announce new support measures, focusing on infrastructure and increasing liquidity in the market. This news has led to a surge in B shares, with investors buying up stocks in anticipation of the market's next moves.\nThe surge in B shares follows a series of major disappointments in the IPO market, where several high-profile companies, including smartphone maker Xiaomi and Tencent-backed WeDoctor, failed to meet expectations. In the wake of these disappointments, investors have been turning to B shares as an alternative investment option.\nChina's B share market, which is largely restricted to foreign investors, is often seen as a barometer of confidence in the Chinese economy, and the latest surge in B shares has been seen as a positive sign for the country's future.\nDespite the positive sentiment, some financial experts advise caution in buying B shares. They argue that the stock market's upward trend in China is largely driven by policy initiatives rather than economic fundamentals. This means that while short-term gains may be possible, investors must remain cautious about long-term investment decisions.\nDespite these warnings, many investors remain bullish on China's potential to break new ground in the global economy. This is driven in part by the country's large population, strong middle class, and rapidly developing tech sector.\nOverall, the surge in B shares on Monday is seen as a positive sign for China's economy. The government's support measures, combined with a growing tech sector and a strong middle class, make China an attractive investment opportunity for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. While caution is still advised, those looking to invest in China's economy are likely to be rewarded in the long-term.", "Hong Kong freight forwarders have warned that air cargo rates from the transpacific route could increase by up to 20%. The warning comes as airlines plan to increase their capacity from China's mainland to North America, resulting in a shortage of available cargo space.\nThere are many factors that could contribute to the increase of rates. The ongoing trade war between the United States and China has led to higher tariffs on goods such as electronics and textiles, which drives up demand for air freight. In addition, the pandemic has caused many airlines to suspend their operations, leading to a decrease in overall capacity and an increase in demand for air cargo.\nThe rise in prices could have a major impact on the supply chain industry and could cause an increase in costs for retailers and customers. It is important for businesses to monitor the situation closely and look for alternative methods of shipping to avoid possible disruptions in the supply chain.", "Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, is experiencing a slow in cocoa arrivals due to delayed export financing. The delay in financing has affected the country's cocoa sector, causing anxiety among key stakeholders and players as they await the government's decision on licences and marketing rates.\nOver the years, Ivory Coast's cocoa sector has been plagued by numerous challenges, such as low productivity, smuggling, and the use of child labor. However, in recent times, the sector has been hit with a new challenge- delayed export financing.\nExport financing is critical to the sector as it facilitates the shipment of cocoa beans to global markets. Without it, cocoa buyers face difficulties in purchasing the beans, and the sector loses out on potential revenue and foreign exchange.\nAccording to industry players, the delay in export financing has resulted in a reduction in cocoa arrivals at the ports, with some farmers opting to store their beans instead of selling them. This, in turn, affects the government's ability to price the beans and determine the marketing rates.\nAs the sector awaits the government's decision on licences and marketing rates, players fear that the delay in export financing will further compound the challenges faced by the sector.\nFarmers, for example, are worried that the delay will result in a drop in the price of cocoa beans, thus affecting their income. They have called on the government to expedite the decision-making process to enable them to plan effectively.\nIn response, the government has assured stakeholders that it is working on a solution to the delayed export financing. Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development have reiterated the government's commitment to ensuring that the sector operates optimally, calling on all players to exercise patience.\nMany industry players have expressed optimism that the government's intervention will restore confidence in the sector and enable cocoa farmers to go about their business without fear of financial losses.\nInternational cocoa buyers have also weighed in on the situation, urging the government to address the challenges facing the sector urgently. They emphasized that the delay in export financing affects not only the farmers but also the global supply chain.\nWhile the government's decision on licensing and marketing rates will undoubtedly have far-reaching effects on the sector, the delay in export financing is a more pressing issue for key players. The government, therefore, needs to address the issue urgently to avoid further disruptions to the sector.\nIt is worth noting that Ivory Coast's cocoa sector plays a critical role in the country's economy, employing millions of people and accounting for a significant portion of the country's foreign exchange earnings. As such, the government needs to take adequate measures to ensure its growth and sustainability.\nIn conclusion, the delay in export financing is a significant challenge facing Ivory Coast's cocoa sector, with potential economic consequences. As the government deliberates on licensing and marketing rates, it needs to address the issue urgently to restore confidence in the sector and enable farmers to continue harvesting and selling their beans without undue delays.", "Silver King, the parent company of HSN (Home Shopping Network), has acquired the popular home shopping network in a stock-swap deal worth $1.27 billion. The move is aimed at expanding the company's reach into the world of broadcast television and establishing itself as a major player in the home-shopping industry.\nThe deal, which was finalized earlier this week, will see HSN become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver King. The acquisition gives Silver King access to HSN's vast customer base of 90 million households across the United States, as well as its established distribution networks and relationships with major vendors.\nThe move is part of a broader strategy by Silver King to expand its presence in the broadcast TV market, where it is already a leading player. The company owns a number of TV stations across the country and has long been involved in the production and distribution of programming.\nAccording to a statement released by the company, Silver King sees HSN as a \"perfect fit\" for its existing operations. The statement suggests that the two companies will work closely together going forward to create new programming and expand their reach into new markets.\n\"We believe that with the combined resources of Silver King and HSN, we can create a powerful new force in the world of broadcast television,\" said Silver King CEO Michael E. Fuchs in the statement. \"We are excited about the potential for this merger and look forward to working together to deliver innovative new programming to viewers across the country.\"\nThe merger comes at a time of rapid growth for the home-shopping industry, which has seen a surge in popularity in recent years as consumers have shifted to online and mobile shopping. HSN, which was founded in 1985, has been at the forefront of this trend, with a range of innovative programming and a focus on high-quality products.\nThe company's CEO, Mindy Grossman, expressed her excitement about the merger in a statement, saying that it \"represents a compelling opportunity for both companies to build on their respective strengths and create a powerful new force in the industry.\"\nAs part of the deal, HSN shareholders will receive shares of Silver King stock in exchange for their shares of HSN. The exact terms of the exchange will be determined in the coming weeks, but it is expected to be completed in the near future.\nThe acquisition is subject to approval by both companies' boards of directors, as well as any necessary regulatory approvals. The two companies have said they expect to complete the deal by the end of the year.", "In a move that is set to hinder foreign investors in the Russian oil sector, parliamentarians in Russia have called for the rejection of proposed legislation that would allow production-sharing agreements for oil reserves in the country. The move follows the recent passing of the bill by the Russian cabinet, which was seen by many as a bold attempt to attract foreign investment in the country's oil sector.\nThe proposed legislation was designed to create a framework for investment in large-scale exploration and development of oil reserves in Russia, allowing foreign companies to participate in joint ventures with Russian state-owned enterprises. Under the bill, foreign companies could invest in projects to explore and extract oil and natural gas in a share of the profits, with the Russian government owning the resource.\nProponents of the bill argue that it would help to diversify the economy and reduce Russia's dependence on oil exports. It was also seen as a way to attract foreign investment, which has been declining in recent years due to sanctions and political risks.\nHowever, the bill has met with stiff opposition from some quarters, with critics claiming that it would undermine the country's sovereignty and hand over control of its resources to foreign investors. The Russian parliamentarians who have called for the bill's rejection claim that it would be detrimental to the country's interests.\nSpeaking on the issue, the head of the parliamentary energy committee, Pavel Zavalniy, argued that the bill would result in the loss of control over oil and gas reserves, and that it could open the way for foreign powers to exert influence over the country's energy sector. He also questioned the need for the legislation at a time when oil prices are low and global demand for the resource is declining.\n\"The adoption of this bill is a direct threat to the sovereignty and national security of Russia,\" he said. \"We do not need to give away our resources to anyone, especially foreign investors who have shown time and again that they are not reliable partners.\"\nForeign companies have also expressed their concerns about the proposed legislation. In a statement released by the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, businesses expressed their disappointment at the rejection of the production-sharing agreement model, and urged the Russian government to reconsider the bill before it is ratified.\n\"We believe that the production-sharing agreement model is the best way to attract foreign investment to the Russian oil sector,\" the statement said. \"By rejecting this model, the Russian government is sending a strong message to foreign investors that they are not welcome in the country.\"\nThe move by the Russian parliamentarians to reject the legislation is likely to be seen as a blow to foreign investors who were hoping to tap into Russia's vast oil reserves. It is also likely to raise questions about the future of investment in the country's oil sector, which has been hit hard by sanctions and political tensions in recent years.\nDespite the challenges facing foreign investors in Russia, some have managed to carve out a niche in the country's oil sector. Companies such as BP, ExxonMobil and Total have all invested heavily in Russia, despite the risks.\nHowever, with the rejection of the production-sharing agreement model, it remains to be seen if these companies will continue to take an interest in the country's oil sector. It is also unclear what the impact will be on Russia's economy, which is heavily reliant on oil exports, and which has been struggling to grow in recent years.\nFor now, it seems that the debate over the proposed legislation will continue, with supporters and opponents continuing to argue over the best way to develop Russia's oil sector. What is clear, however, is that the decision by parliamentarians to reject the bill marks another setback for foreign investors hoping to stake a claim in Russia's vast energy reserves.", "California-based technology company, HP, has launched a new printer that has been dubbed \"revolutionary\". The device, known as the \"Mopier\", is being pitched as a challenger to copier giants like Xerox. HP hopes to shake up the printing industry by offering businesses a more efficient, cost-effective way to produce large-scale printouts.\nThe Mopier, which stands for \"Multifunctional Original Printer\", goes beyond a traditional printer's capabilities. It can not only print documents but also scan and copy them. What makes this device truly unique is that it can print out multiple copies of a document without the need for a separate copier. HP claims that this feature makes the Mopier the world's first true \"mopier\".\nAccording to HP, the Mopier can produce up to 250 pages per minute, making it faster than most conventional copiers. What's more, it uses less energy and requires less maintenance. With its advanced features and speed, the Mopier could revolutionize the way businesses produce and distribute their print materials.\nThe Mopier also boasts a range of security features. It supports secure printing, where a password is required to release the print job, and there are multiple layers of authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive documents. HP has also built-in features that detect and prevent any potential security breaches.\nThe printer is designed to work seamlessly with HP's range of software and hardware products. This means that businesses can easily integrate the Mopier into their existing workflows, creating a more streamlined and efficient process. HP also offers a range of support services to help businesses get the most out of their Mopier printer.\nHP's decision to enter the copier market is a bold move. Copier giant Xerox dominates the market, with a 38% share, according to IDC. However, HP believes that the Mopier printer has the potential to disrupt the copier industry. While copiers are still in demand for certain tasks, such as producing large volumes of prints quickly, the Mopier provides a viable alternative that offers greater flexibility and cost savings.\nWhile the Mopier is not the first printer/copier hybrid on the market, it is the first device that can print large volumes of documents without the need for a separate copier. This is an exciting new development that could help businesses save time and money.\nThe Mopier is available for purchase now from HP's website and authorized resellers. Prices start at $9,999 for the base model and go up from there depending on the configuration. While this may seem expensive, HP believes that the long-term cost savings will be significant. Businesses that produce large volumes of print materials could see a return on their investment in just a few months.\nOverall, the launch of the Mopier is an exciting development in the printing industry. It offers businesses a more efficient, cost-effective way to produce large-scale printouts. With its advanced features, speed, and security, the Mopier could help HP challenge copier giants like Xerox. It will be interesting to see how the market responds to this new device, but for now, the future of printing looks brighter than ever.", "In a historic move, the Federal Reserve has voted to allow banks to expand into the securities industry. The decision comes after years of debate and lobbying by financial institutions seeking to expand their portfolios.\nThe move is expected to have far-reaching implications for the financial industry as banks will now be able to offer greater investment opportunities to their customers. It also marks a major shift in the regulatory landscape, as the Federal Reserve has traditionally been skeptical of allowing banks to engage in risky investment activities.\nThe decision was not without controversy, however, as some critics have raised concerns about the potential for banks to engage in risky behavior. They argue that allowing banks to expand into the securities industry could lead to another financial crisis, similar to the one that occurred in 2008.\nDespite these concerns, the Federal Reserve ultimately decided that the benefits of expanding into the securities industry outweighed the risks. In a statement released after the vote, the Federal Reserve said that it believes that banks can manage the risks associated with securities activities effectively.\n\u201cWe believe that allowing banks to expand into the securities industry will promote greater competition and innovation in the financial sector while also providing consumers with more investment options,\u201d the statement read.\nThe decision was met with mixed reactions in the financial industry. Some banks hailed it as a major victory, saying that it will allow them to better serve their customers while also helping to diversify their portfolios.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a game-changer for our industry,\u201d said John Smith, CEO of Bank of America. \u201cWe are thrilled to be able to offer our customers a wider range of investment opportunities and look forward to growing our business in this area.\u201d\nOthers, however, were more cautious, warning that the risks associated with securities activities are not to be taken lightly.\n\u201cThis is a significant step forward for the industry, but it\u2019s important to remember that securities activities are inherently risky,\u201d said Jane Doe, CEO of JPMorgan Chase. \u201cWe need to be careful and thoughtful as we explore this new avenue for growth.\u201d\nDespite these concerns, many experts believe that the decision to allow banks to expand into the securities industry will ultimately be a positive development for the financial sector.\n\u201cThe financial industry has been seeking greater flexibility and more opportunities to grow and diversify their portfolios,\u201d said Adam Smith, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. \u201cThis decision will allow banks to do just that, while also promoting competition and innovation in the industry.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to allow banks to expand into the securities industry marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the financial sector. While there are certainly risks associated with securities activities, many experts believe that allowing banks to engage in these activities will ultimately be a positive development for consumers and the industry as a whole. Only time will tell exactly how this decision will shape the future of the financial sector, but one thing is certain: the industry is poised for significant change in the coming years.", "Marjorie Scardino, the first female CEO of the Financial Times and former CEO of Pearson, has been appointed as the new CEO of Pearson. In an interview with the Financial Times, Scardino said that she plans to implement radical changes at the education company to address the growing inequality in education and improve the quality of education globally.\nScardino, who previously ran Pearson for 16 years, is known for her strong focus on education and literacy. During her tenure at Pearson, she helped to reshape the company into a digital learning and assessment platform. Scardino says that she plans to continue this focus on digital learning, but also wants to address issues around inequality and access to education.\n\"I think education is the most important thing that we can do in the world, and I'm passionate about it,\" said Scardino. \"I think that education is the key to social inclusion, economic prosperity, and a good quality of life.\"\nScardino's plans for Pearson will include a focus on using technology to improve access to education for more people around the world. She sees technology as a powerful tool for democratising education and providing more opportunities for learners to access the resources and support they need to succeed.\n\"I think technology is absolutely essential to education, particularly to making education available to everyone around the world,\" said Scardino. \"It can provide personalised learning that meets the needs of each individual student, regardless of where they are, what language they speak, or what resources they have access to.\"\nHowever, Scardino also acknowledges that technology alone is not enough. That's why she plans to work on building partnerships and collaborations with governments, NGOs, and other stakeholders to mobilise resources and support to address the root causes of educational inequality.\n\"That's why we need to build collaborations and partnerships with everyone who cares about education, from policymakers to NGOs, to ensure that we have the resources and the support we need to make a real difference,\" said Scardino.\nTo achieve her vision for Pearson, Scardino says that the company will need to be more focused and strategic in its investments and efforts. This means divesting from non-core businesses and investing in areas where Pearson has a strong competitive advantage and can make the most impact.\n\"I think we need to focus on our core strengths, and really prioritise our investments and our efforts,\" said Scardino. \"That means divesting from non-core businesses and investing in areas where we have a strong competitive advantage, where we can make the most impact, and where we can really change lives through education.\"\nScardino's appointment has been welcomed by education experts and advocates, who see her as a strong leader who can bring a fresh perspective and a renewed focus on education to Pearson.\n\"I think Marjorie Scardino is the right person to lead Pearson at this critical moment in time,\" said Sir Ken Robinson, internationally recognised authority on creativity and innovation in education. \"Her passion for education and her track record of success in the industry make her ideally suited to drive change and create a more inclusive and equitable education system for all.\"\nIn conclusion, Scardino's appointment as the new CEO of Pearson marks a new era for the education company. Her vision and leadership will be critical in addressing the challenges facing education today and ensuring that more people around the world have access to quality education.", "Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, has unveiled a series of massive financial reforms aimed at propelling the country's economy forward and catching up with the West. Dubbed the \"Big Bang\" reforms, these initiatives will address key issues such as deregulation, privatization, and corporate governance in order to improve the country's economic prospects.\nSuga, who was only recently elected in September, has made economic revitalization a key priority of his administration. These ambitious reforms are designed to create jobs, attract foreign investment, and increase productivity across all sectors of the economy.\nAmong the most significant changes proposed by the government is a major deregulation initiative. This would involve relaxing restrictions on businesses in several key sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and education. The aim is to encourage greater competition and innovation, while also making it easier for new businesses to enter the market.\nAnother key area of reform is privatization. The government has set a target of raising JPY4 trillion ($38 billion) by selling off some of its stakes in state-owned businesses, including Japan Post, Japan Tobacco, and the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan. This will not only provide a much-needed injection of cash into the economy, but it will also help to spur greater efficiency and innovation within these companies.\nCorporate governance is another important area of focus for the government. Japan has long been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability in this area, and Suga is determined to change that. He has proposed a range of measures that would effectively force companies to be more open and transparent about their operations, including increased disclosure requirements for executive pay and greater representation for independent directors on company boards.\nIn addition to these major reforms, the government is also looking to boost investment in innovation, particularly in cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics. This will involve partnerships between the government and the private sector, as well as greater investment in research and development.\nWhile these ambitious reforms are undoubtedly a step in the right direction, there are concerns about how they will be implemented in practice. Some critics have argued that the government may be targeting the wrong areas, and that other issues, such as social inequality and the environment, should also be given greater attention.\nFurthermore, some have raised concerns about the impact of these reforms on ordinary Japanese people, many of whom are struggling with low wages and high living costs. While Suga has vowed to create more jobs and increase wages, it remains to be seen whether these promises will be fulfilled in practice.\nDespite these concerns, there is no doubt that the \"Big Bang\" reforms represent a significant step forward for Japan. The country has long been struggling with economic stagnation, and these reforms have the potential to create a more dynamic and innovative economy that can compete with the best in the world.\nIn a statement announcing the reforms, Suga emphasized the importance of Japan building a strong and resilient economy that can weather the challenges of the future. He called on all Japanese people to work together to make this vision a reality.\n\"We must seize this opportunity to transform our economy and make it more dynamic, innovative, and competitive,\" he said. \"By working together, we can build a stronger and more prosperous Japan that can thrive in the 21st century and beyond.\"", "Seattle, Washington - The Boeing Co. announced on Wednesday that it had recorded a 13% increase in its profits for the third quarter of 2021. The rise in profits came on the back of strong sales of its commercial jets and a rise in interest income.\nThe company, which is headquartered in Chicago, reported a net profit of $1.87 billion, compared to the $1.66 billion it recorded in the same period last year. The revenues went up by 7% to $18.3 billion from $17 billion in the previous year. The latest financial results have exceeded the expectations of industry analysts.\n\"The third-quarter results reflect our commitment to innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, all of which are essential to the success of our business,\" said Boeing's CEO David Calhoun while commenting on the results. \"We are making progress in our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our competitiveness.\"\nThe company's Commercial Airplanes division saw favorable sales during the quarter, driven by the continued demand for its 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Despite the supply chain disruptions, Boeing has managed to deliver 156 commercial aircraft during the period, up from 139 aircraft in the same quarter last year. The company has a backlog of 4,100 aircraft, providing it with a solid base of future earnings.\nBoeing's Defense, Space, and Security division also reported growth in revenue, driven by the U.S military's demand for its Chinook and Apache helicopters, F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, and satellite systems. Its Global Services division, however, suffered a decline in revenue due to the continued impact of the pandemic on its commercial customers.\nBoeing's bottom line was further boosted by its rising interest income, which grew to $532 million from $160 million in the previous year. The increase in interest income came as the company repaid some of its long-term debt by issuing new bonds at lower rates.\nHowever, the news is not all rosy for Boeing. The company is still dealing with the after-effects of the 737 MAX crisis, with production levels yet to meet pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, supply chain issues and a shortage of skilled labor are creating headwinds for the company.\nDespite these challenges, Boeing remains optimistic about its long-term prospects. The company is forecasting higher deliveries of commercial aircraft next year, and it expects to receive certification for its 777X wide-body jet by mid-2023.\nInvestors seem to be bullish on Boeing's future growth prospects, with the company's stock price rising by 3.5% to close at $220.67 on Wednesday following the announcement of its financial results.\nBoeing's positive results are a welcome boost to the aviation industry, which has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. The company's continued success will mark another milestone in the recovery of the tourism and business sectors.", "Dominion Resources Inc is currently facing a potential reconsideration of their offer price for East Midlands Electricity Plc, according to analysts in the industry. The energy company had previously made an offer to acquire the UK-based electricity provider, but it seems the offer may not have been high enough to satisfy all parties involved.\nSeveral analysts have expressed concerns that Dominion Resources Inc may not have accurately assessed the true value of East Midlands Electricity Plc, and that the offer they put forward may not be competitive enough. It is believed that other companies are already eyeing the electricity provider, and that Dominion Resources Inc may need to sweeten their offer in order to stay in the running.\nEast Midlands Electricity Plc is a significant player in the UK electricity market, and any acquisition of the company would be met with considerable interest. Dominion Resources Inc has already stated that they are committed to expanding their presence in the global energy market, and acquiring East Midlands Electricity Plc would certainly help to further this goal.\nHowever, analysts warn that the company may need to tread carefully in order to avoid overpaying for the electricity provider. With other companies also interested in the acquisition, Dominion Resources Inc may need to act quickly if they want to secure the deal.\nAll eyes are now on Dominion Resources Inc as they weigh their options and consider their next move in the quest to acquire East Midlands Electricity Plc. Whether they will adjust their offer price, or decide to pull out of the running altogether, remains to be seen.", "Prague, Czech Republic- Czech Prime Minister and Economics Professor Vaclav Klaus has predicted a small but perpetual trade gap in the country's economic future. Launching his much-awaited book \"A Blue Pencil of a Market Economy\" in Prague this week, Klaus highlighted the trade deficit as a major concern for the Czech economy.\nAccording to Klaus, the country's focus on imports and lack of emphasis on exports could lead to long-term economic repercussions. He stated that though the trade gap may be small, it is expected to persist for the foreseeable future due to the country's export limitations.\nThe Czech Republic experienced a trade deficit of Kc 42.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, representing a 67% increase from the same period in 2020. Additionally, the country has seen a consistent trade deficit since 1998. With exports accounting for only 75% of the country's GDP, Klaus states that this is insufficient for an economy of its size and potential.\nMoreover, Klaus argues that the country's dependence on a few major industries hinders its ability to establish a competitive export market. He identifies automobile production and other manufacturing industries as the driving force behind the country's export market, but states that to increase export revenue, the country needs to diversify.\nKlaus suggests that cultivating an entrepreneurial spirit, improving education, increasing research and development, and investing in technology will stimulate the production of innovative apps, devices, and platforms. He notes that prioritizing startups and SMEs and fostering innovation will greatly contribute to the development of a resilient and sustainable economy.\nIn the book, Klaus also takes aim at the European Union's Green Deal. The Prime Minister claims that the EU's ambitious climate goals will inevitably harm the economy, as they will drive up costs for businesses. Klaus instead believes that European countries should invest in new technologies and green energy without relying solely on regulatory measures from the EU.\nThe Czech Republic is one of the largest coal producers in the European Union and currently generates 40% of its electricity from coal. The government has committed to phase out coal-based electricity production by 2038 and has set a target of having 22% of its electricity generated from renewable sources by 2030.\nKlaus's book has gained significant attention due to his extensive experience in economics and his two stints as Prime Minister of the country. The book comprises a collection of articles on economic theory, globalization, post-communist transformation, and the relationship between government and the market economy.\nPublic response to Klaus's predictions has been mixed, with some praising his insights while others criticize his controversial views on climate change and the EU's Green Deal.\nRegardless of the debate, Klaus's warnings on the country's economic future should not be taken lightly. The Czech Republic must reevaluate its economic strategy and work towards exporting a more diverse range of products to the global market. For this to happen, the country must address its growth limitations, focus on innovation and technology, support startups, and invest in education to prepare its workforce for the rapidly evolving global economy.", "Consumer goods company Reckitt & Colman has announced plans to give \u00a3152 million back to its shareholders through an innovative scheme. The scheme, called a \"buyback\", allows shareholders to sell their shares back to the company at a premium, giving them a cash windfall.\nThe announcement comes as Reckitt & Colman, the parent company of well-known brands such as Durex, Nurofen, and Vanish, reported strong financial results for the first half of 2021. The company's revenue was up 10.6% on the same period last year, thanks to increased demand for its products during the pandemic.\nThe buyback scheme is an alternative to paying dividends, which Reckitt & Colman has traditionally done. Dividends are payments made to shareholders out of a company's profits, but they are subject to taxation. Buybacks, on the other hand, are treated as a return of capital and are therefore not subject to tax, making them a more tax-efficient way of returning money to shareholders.\nUnder the scheme, which will run from 3rd September to 28th October, Reckitt & Colman will offer to buy back up to \u00a3152 million worth of shares. Shareholders will be able to sell their shares back to the company at a premium of up to 5% of the share price.\nIn a statement, Reckitt & Colman CEO Laxman Narasimhan said: \"We are pleased to offer this innovative scheme to our shareholders as an alternative to dividends. We believe this demonstrates our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders in a tax-efficient way.\"\nThe buyback scheme is part of a larger trend among companies to find new ways of returning money to shareholders. With interest rates at historic lows and the pandemic causing uncertainty in the markets, many investors are looking for reliable ways to generate income.\nAccording to data from the Office for National Statistics, UK companies spent a record \u00a3100 billion on buybacks in 2020, up from \u00a356 billion in 2019. This trend is expected to continue as companies look for ways to deliver value to their shareholders.\nHowever, buyback schemes are not without controversy. Critics argue that they can artificially inflate share prices and benefit shareholders who are looking to sell their shares, rather than those who are holding onto them. Some also argue that buybacks can be a sign that a company is struggling to find productive ways to invest its profits.\nDespite these concerns, however, the Reckitt & Colman buyback scheme has been well-received by investors. Since the announcement, the company's share price has risen by over 2%, indicating that shareholders are optimistic about the scheme's potential to generate value.\nOverall, the Reckitt & Colman buyback scheme is an interesting example of how companies are finding new ways to deliver value to their shareholders in a challenging economic environment. As the trend towards buybacks and other innovative schemes continues, it will be interesting to see how investors respond \u2013 and whether these schemes will become a permanent feature of the corporate landscape.", "H&R Block, the US tax preparation company, is having difficulties with spinning off CompuServe, its online service. The move is intended to boost the company's performance, which has been weighed down by decreasing demand for tax preparation services in recent years.\nCompuServe, which was once a major internet service provider, has been struggling to compete with other online services like Google and Yahoo. H&R Block has been trying to sell the business for some time, but has been thwarted by the lack of interested buyers.\nThe company's latest effort to spin off CompuServe has been complicated by the online service's poor financial performance. According to sources familiar with the matter, CompuServe has been losing customers at a significant rate, and is projected to lose money for the foreseeable future.\nH&R Block's management team is said to be considering various options, including a partial spin-off or a sale to a private equity firm. The company is expected to make a decision on the future of CompuServe in the coming months.\nThe struggles with CompuServe come at a time when H&R Block is facing increasing competition from new players in the tax preparation industry. Online tax services like TurboTax and TaxAct have been eating into the company's market share, forcing H&R Block to shift its focus to other areas like financial advisory and insurance services.\nDespite these challenges, H&R Block remains one of the largest tax preparation firms in the US, with over 10,000 offices across the country. The company has been expanding its services in recent years to include wealth management, mortgage lending, and personal finance advice, with mixed success.\nIn its most recent financial results, H&R Block reported a $630 million loss for the fiscal year ending in April 2020, due in part to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the US economy. The company has since rebounded somewhat, with a profit of $216 million in the first quarter of 2021.\nAnalysts suggest that H&R Block needs to find a way to cultivate more long-term relationships with customers, rather than relying on one-time tax preparation fees. The company's CEO, Jeff Jones, has hinted at plans to shift towards more personalized, year-round financial services that could help build customer loyalty over time.\nDespite the challenges facing H&R Block, the company remains committed to its mission of providing trusted financial advice to Americans. The fate of CompuServe may be uncertain, but the company's leadership is determined to find new and innovative ways to serve its customers in an ever-changing market.", "Microsoft Corporation has announced that they will be licensing Fore Systems' high-speed networking technology for their future Windows operating systems.

Whether it's between major players like Microsoft and Fore Systems or between smaller startups, these partnerships can help drive innovation and improve the user experience for everyone involved.", "Czech politics has experienced yet another setback as rising infighting among the opposition party threatens its chances in the upcoming elections. The party, which has been facing a steady decline in support among voters, is now grappling with internal discord that seems to be spiraling out of control.\nThe party, which has been in existence for several decades, has always prided itself on being a unifying force for the opposition in Czech politics. However, recent events paint a worrying picture ahead of the next elections.\nOne source of conflict has been the party's leadership. There has been a simmering feud between party loyalists and those calling for change and reform within the party's leadership. The pro-reform faction argues that the party\u2019s current leadership is out of touch with the realities of modern politics and lacks the vision necessary to lead the party to victory in the upcoming elections.\nThe pro-reform faction has been pushing for the appointment of new faces in the leadership positions, arguing that the party needs fresh ideas and perspectives if it is to stand any chance of winning against the ruling party. The arguments have, however, attracted a fierce backlash from party loyalists who view the push for leadership changes as an attempt to undermine the party\u2019s existing structure and hierarchy.\nThe infighting has already resulted in a number of high-profile resignations, with some members citing the deep divisions within the party as their reason for leaving. The resignations have added to the already existing concerns about the party's unity, especially at a time when the opposition needs to present a united front against the ruling party if it hopes to secure electoral victory.\n\u201cThese internal struggles could hardly have come at a worse time for our party,\u201d said a former party insider who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe are now facing a crucial election, where the opposition needs to present a united front if it hopes to win over voters. The infighting is making this impossible.\u201d\nThe opposition party's dwindling support among voters has also been a cause for concern. The party has been losing ground to the ruling party, with opinion polls regularly putting the party\u2019s support at less than 20%- well below the ruling party's rating. The latest polls indicate that the party\u2019s support has slipped further, raising questions about its chances in the next election.\nThe party's leaders attribute the declining support to the government's overwhelming control of the media, which they accuse of promoting the ruling party's policies at the expense of other political parties. The opposition party has been particularly critical of state-owned media, arguing that it has effectively become a propaganda tool for the government.\nCritics, however, argue that the party's declining fortunes are a result of its own shortcomings, including a lack of clear policies, poor communication with voters, and an inability to effectively challenge the government's policies.\n\u201cThe opposition's problems go beyond the media bias issue,\u201d says John Smith, a political analyst. \u201cThe party has failed to articulate a clear vision for the country, and that has been a major factor in its declining support among voters.\u201d\nThe infighting has further compounded the opposition party's problems, and some analysts are questioning whether it can overcome the internal discord in time for the next election. The party's leadership has identified the need to put its house in order if it is to stand any chance of winning against the ruling party.\n\u201cWe recognize that there are deep divisions within the party, and we are committed to addressing these issues,\u201d says the party's leader. \u201cWe are now engaged in a process of reaching out to all sides, to find common ground, and to work towards a united opposition front ahead of the next elections.\u201d\nThe opposition party's chances in the next election will depend on its ability to overcome internal divisions and present a clear vision that resonates with voters. With just a few months to go, the party has little time left to address its internal problems and focus on the task ahead. The next few months will be crucial. If the party fails to address its internal discord, it risks fading into irrelevance, leaving the ruling party to continue unchallenged.", "The absence of Deng Xiaoping from the Long March rally in China has sparked concerns about the leader's health. Deng is one of the most prominent Chinese leaders, having played a huge role in China's political landscape for many years. The Long March was a historic landmark in China's struggle for revolution and communism, and the event holds great significance to many Chinese citizens, especially those who fought in it.\nThe Long March rally is a nationwide event that takes place every few years to commemorate the historic march led by the Red Army during the Chinese Civil War. The rally brings together officials and citizens from different parts of China to celebrate Chinese nationalism and unity. Participants wave red flags and carry banners and placards.\nThis year's rally was held in Yudu County, Jiangxi Province, where the Red Army was founded. The event was attended by many high-ranking officials, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. However, Deng Xiaoping, who also fought in the Long March during his younger days, was not present.\nAccording to reports, Deng Xiaoping's health is fragile, and he is being cared for by a team of medical experts. The 97-year-old leader has been in poor health for several years, and he has not been seen in public for quite some time. Many Chinese citizens are concerned about his wellbeing and have taken to social media to express their thoughts and prayers.\nDeng's absence from the Long March rally has ignited rumors about his health and caused concern over the future leadership of China. He is considered one of the most influential leaders in modern Chinese history, having played a role in major events such as the Cultural Revolution and China's economic reforms.\nDeng's legacy continues to shape Chinese politics, and his absence at the Long March commemoration is a significant loss for many Chinese citizens. However, many also believe that his ideas and teachings will continue to guide China for years to come.\nThe Long March commemoration is not just a celebration of China's history but also a reminder of its present and future. It serves as a rallying cry for Chinese unity and resilience, and it is an opportunity for China's leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the country's goals and values.\nIn closing, Deng Xiaoping's absence from the Long March rally has sparked concerns about his health and raised questions about the future of China's leadership. However, his legacy continues to shape China, and his absence will not diminish the significance of the event. China will continue to march forward, with or without Deng Xiaoping, guided by its leaders, citizens, and rich history.", "BHP Expected to Report Fall in Half Year Net Profit, But Analysts Predict a Rebound for Australia's Biggest Company\nAustralia's biggest mining company, BHP Group, is expected to report a fall in its half-year net profit, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in the global markets. The company's results for the first half of the fiscal year 2021 will be announced on February 16, and analysts are predicting a decline in earnings. However, they are also positive that BHP's diversified portfolio and cost-cutting measures will help the company rebound in the near future.\nBHP reported a net profit of $4.9 billion for the first half of the fiscal year 2020; however, this year, analysts predict a net profit of around $4 billion \u2013 a decline of 20%. The company's revenue is also expected to fall by 7% to $23.3 billion, compared with $25.1 billion in the first half of the previous year.\nOne of the main factors behind BHP's expected decline in earnings is the weakening demand for commodities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and restrictions on movement have disrupted the global economy, leading to lower demand for minerals and metals such as iron ore, copper, and coal. The pandemic has also caused supply chain disruptions, which have affected production and shipping.\nThe lockdowns in China, which is the world's largest consumer of commodities, have particularly affected BHP's sales. The company earns around a third of its revenue from China, and the restrictions on movement in the country have led to lower demand for commodities and lower prices.\nHowever, while the pandemic has caused significant challenges for BHP, the company's diversified portfolio has also helped it weather the storm. BHP has a portfolio of minerals, including iron ore, copper, nickel, and coal, which helps the company to remain resilient against fluctuations in demand for individual commodities. The company's iron ore business, in particular, has been performing well, with strong demand from China.\nBHP has also implemented cost-cutting measures, including reducing production levels at some of its mines and reducing its workforce. The company has also made investments in new technologies and efficiencies to improve productivity and lower costs.\nAnalysts are optimistic about BHP's future, predicting a rebound in earnings as the global economy recovers and demand for commodities increases. The rollout of vaccines across the world is expected to lead to a loosening of pandemic restrictions and a return to normal economic activity. This, in turn, is expected to boost demand for commodities, particularly in developing countries.\nThe growing demand for electric vehicles is also expected to drive demand for copper, nickel, and other metals used in battery production. BHP has a strong portfolio of copper and nickel assets, which positions the company well to take advantage of this growing market. The company's Jansen potash project in Canada is also expected to provide a significant boost to earnings once it is operational.\nBHP's CEO, Mike Henry, has also expressed optimism about the company's future. In a statement in January, Henry said that \"the fundamentals for commodities remain strong, particularly driven by population and global GDP growth, and the transition to lower-emissions economies.\" Henry also highlighted BHP's strengths, stating that \"we are well-positioned, with our diversified portfolio of high-quality, low-cost assets, to benefit from these trends\".\nIn conclusion, BHP is expected to report a fall in its half-year net profit, as the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions in the global markets. However, analysts are optimistic about the company's future, predicting a rebound in earnings as the global economy recovers and demand for commodities increases. BHP's diversified portfolio and cost-cutting measures are expected to help the company weather the storm and position it well for long-term growth. As the world continues to recover from the pandemic, BHP will be one to watch.", "Optus Communications, one of Australia\u2019s leading telecommunications companies, has reported its first annual profit and is now preparing for a sharemarket float.\nThe company, which has been operating since 1981, has been making significant strides lately, including achieving a net profit after tax (NPAT) of AU$146m for the 2020 financial year. The achievement marks a significant milestone for Optus, which had previously reported an annual loss of AU$41m in 2019.\nWith this win under its belt, the company is now taking steps to expand its investor base and has announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). According to sources, Optus\u2019 parent company Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) is looking to list up to 25% of the Australian business, with the IPO rumoured to be worth around AU$2bn.\nThe decision to go public is a significant move for the company, which has traditionally been a private entity. However, it is a strategic move for Optus, which aims to increase its capitalisation and leverage new investment opportunities.\nDespite the ongoing pandemic and the economic impact it has had on many businesses, Optus\u2019 strong performance has allowed it to weather the storm and continue expanding its services. With Australia\u2019s increasing demand for faster and more reliable internet services, Optus is well-positioned to take advantage of the market\u2019s growth potential.\n\u201cWe are excited about the opportunity to expand our business and bring new innovations to the market. With the support of our investors, we can continue to grow and provide our customers with the best possible services,\u201d said Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, CEO of Optus.\nOptus has also been actively investing in its infrastructure to maintain its competitive edge. In June 2020, the company announced it would be investing AU$500m over two years to improve its networks and services, including 5G capabilities.\nAs part of its expansion plans, Optus is also looking to expand into new areas beyond traditional telecommunications. In 2020, it launched Optus Sport, a streaming service offering live and on-demand sports content. The service has been well-received, with more than 700,000 people signing up for Optus Sport subscriptions.\n\u201cWe are exploring new opportunities to bring our customers more value and enhance their overall experience with our brand. Optus Sport is just one example of this, and we hope to launch more innovative services in the future,\u201d said Bayer Rosmarin.\nIt remains to be seen what impact the IPO will have on Optus and its customers. There are concerns that a public listing may cause the company to focus more on short-term profits than long-term investments, which could negatively affect the quality of its services.\nFor now, however, Optus remains focused on its expansion plans and growing its customer base. With the launch of its multi-billion IPO, the company has signalled its intention to be a major player in the Australian telecommunications industry for years to come.", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on Tuesday that it will eliminate a rule that has required telecommunications companies to provide advance notice of long-distance rate changes. The decision comes nearly two years after the FCC first proposed the rule change.\nUnder the current rule, carriers have been required to provide 30 days\u2019 notice to their customers before increasing long-distance rates. However, the FCC believes that the rule is no longer necessary due to changes in the telecommunications industry.\nIn recent years, the FCC has been focused on promoting competition and reducing regulation in the telecommunications industry. Chairman Ajit Pai has argued that deregulation will encourage innovation and investment in the sector, and he has pushed to eliminate outdated rules that he believes are hindering growth.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the advance notice rule is expected to be welcomed by telecommunications companies, who have argued that the rule is unnecessary and burdensome. The companies have argued that they need more flexibility to respond to changes in the market and to compete with each other.\nThe FCC\u2019s decision was met with criticism from consumer advocacy groups, who argued that the rule was important for protecting consumers from price gouging. Many consumer advocates worry that eliminating the rule will allow telecommunications companies to raise rates without giving their customers adequate notice, putting them at a disadvantage.\n\u201cThe FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the advance notice rule is a step backwards for consumers,\u201d said John Bergmayer, senior counsel at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \u201cWithout adequate notice, consumers will be left to navigate complicated pricing structures without the information they need to make informed decisions.\u201d\nThe FCC\u2019s decision also drew criticism from some lawmakers, who accused the commission of prioritizing the interests of telecommunications companies over those of consumers. Democratic Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who has been a vocal critic of Chairman Pai\u2019s deregulatory agenda, called the decision \u201canother example of the FCC abandoning its role as a watchdog for consumers and small businesses.\u201d\nDespite the criticism, the FCC remains committed to promoting deregulation and competition in the telecommunications industry. Chairman Pai has argued that eliminating outdated rules will allow the industry to adapt to changing market conditions and provide better services to consumers.\n\u201cAs our communications networks continue to evolve, the FCC is committed to ensuring that our rules keep pace with these changes,\u201d Pai said in a statement. \u201cThis decision is an important step toward promoting innovation and investment in the telecommunications industry, and we look forward to continuing our work to create a regulatory environment that encourages growth and competition.\u201d\nThe FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the advance notice rule is just one of many changes that the commission has made in recent months as part of its broader deregulatory agenda. Earlier this year, the FCC repealed net neutrality rules that had required internet service providers to treat all internet traffic equally. The repeal was met with widespread criticism from consumer advocates and internet companies who argued that it would allow ISPs to discriminate against certain types of traffic and give preferential treatment to their own services.\nDespite the controversy, Chairman Pai remains committed to his vision of a deregulated telecommunications industry. While the FCC\u2019s decision to eliminate the advance notice rule may be a small victory for telecommunications companies, it remains to be seen what the long-term consequences of deregulation will be for consumers and the industry as a whole.", "New York, NY - AOL, the pioneering company that helped bring the internet to households around the world, has announced a major reorganization of its operations and a new flat-rate pricing plan that could shake up the entire industry.\nThe company, which was founded in 1985 as America Online, has undergone many transformations over the years, but this latest move represents a bold new strategy aimed at securing its future in an ever-changing digital landscape.\nAccording to a press release issued by the company, the reorganization will involve a consolidation of its various business units and a renewed focus on its core strengths, such as email and instant messaging services. The company will also be investing heavily in new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\"We are excited to take this bold step forward and align our organization for growth,\" said Tim Armstrong, CEO of AOL. \"Our new structure will enable us to better serve our customers and partners, and to stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing digital world.\"\nIn addition to the reorganization, AOL also announced a new flat-rate pricing plan for its internet service. Under the plan, customers will pay a fixed monthly fee for unlimited access to the internet, regardless of how much data they use.\nThis represents a departure from the traditional pricing models used by most internet providers, which charge customers based on the amount of data they consume.\n\"Our new pricing plan is simple and easy to understand,\" said Armstrong. \"We believe it will be a game-changer in the industry and will make internet access more affordable and accessible for everyone.\"\nThe new plan will apply to all of AOL's internet services, including its popular AOL Mail and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) products.\nReaction to the announcement has been mixed, with some industry experts expressing skepticism about the viability of the new pricing model.\n\"It's an interesting idea, but I'm not convinced it will work in the long run,\" said John Doe, an analyst at research firm Gartner. \"Data usage is continuing to grow exponentially, and at some point, the costs of providing unlimited access will become unsustainable.\"\nOthers, however, are more optimistic about the plan, and see it as a way for AOL to differentiate itself from competitors and attract new customers.\n\"I think it's a smart move,\" said Jane Smith, a technology consultant. \"People are tired of being nickel-and-dimed by their internet providers, and a flat rate plan is a refreshing change. It could definitely give AOL an edge.\"\nRegardless of whether the new pricing plan succeeds or not, one thing is clear: AOL is not afraid to take risks and try new things. With its reorganization and renewed focus on innovation, the company is positioning itself to remain a major player in the digital world for years to come.", "China's government has blocked access to the Playboy website in a move that reflects the country's increased online censorship. The government's decision to block the website comes as the use of the Internet in China is rapidly growing, with millions of Chinese citizens relying on it for work, education, and entertainment.\nThe Playboy website, which features nude photos and articles on sex and relationships, has been blocked in China since January. It is not the first time that China has blocked foreign websites that it deems to be inappropriate or against its values. In recent years, the government has censored various websites including Facebook, Twitter, and Google. However, the decision to block the Playboy website is seen as particularly significant due to the website's history and reputation as a symbol of western hedonism.\nChina's leaders have long been wary of the impact of western culture on its own society. In recent years, they have stepped up their efforts to curb the influence of foreign media, which they see as a threat to the Chinese way of life. This has led to the censorship of foreign TV shows, movies, and publications.\nHowever, the blocking of the Playboy website could also be seen as part of a wider crackdown on online content that the government deems inappropriate. The number of Chinese internet users has increased more than tenfold in the past two decades, with some estimates suggesting that over 900 million people now have access to the internet in China. With such a large population using the internet, the government has become increasingly concerned with ensuring that citizens are not exposed to unsuitable content, such as pornography or extremist propaganda.\nThe move to block the Playboy website has been met with mixed reactions from Chinese citizens. Some have welcomed the government's decision, arguing that the website's content is morally corrupt and harmful to society. Others, however, have criticized the move as an infringement of their freedom of speech and expression. Many have also pointed out that the government's censorship efforts are often arbitrary and inconsistent. While the Playboy website has been blocked, other websites with similar content, including some that are Chinese-owned, remain accessible.\nThe blocking of the Playboy website is not the only recent example of the government's tightening grip on online content. In 2019, a new cybersecurity law came into effect that requires all websites operating in China to register with the government and adhere to strict censorship regulations. The law also gives the government the power to access user data and to shut down websites if they are deemed to be engaging in illegal activities.\nSome observers have suggested that the government's decision to block the Playboy website could be part of a wider campaign to promote traditional Chinese values and culture. President Xi Jinping has called for a rejuvenation of Chinese culture and a return to traditional values, in contrast to what he sees as the corrupting influence of western culture. This has included a push to promote traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts, as well as a crackdown on online content that is seen as vulgar or obscene.\nHowever, others have questioned whether the government's censorship efforts are really about promoting traditional values, or whether they are simply an attempt to control the flow of information and suppress dissent. Critics argue that the government's restrictions on online content have been used to silence political dissidents and to stifle free speech. Some have also pointed out that the government's censorship efforts are often implemented in an ad hoc and arbitrary manner, with some websites being blocked for no clear reason.\nDespite these criticisms, the government shows no signs of loosening its grip on online content. As the number of Chinese internet users continues to grow, the government is likely to become even more concerned with ensuring that citizens are not exposed to unsuitable content. This could lead to even more restrictive censorship measures in the future.\nIn conclusion, the decision to block access to the Playboy website in China is a reflection of the government's increasing censorship efforts. As the number of Chinese internet users continues to grow, the government is likely to become even more concerned with ensuring that citizens are not exposed to unsuitable content. Whether this is a genuine attempt to promote traditional Chinese values or simply an attempt to suppress dissent remains to be seen. However, it is clear that the government's censorship efforts are having a significant impact on the online lives of Chinese citizens.", "DirecTV Slashes Price of Entry-Level Receiver to Fend Off Cable Competitors\nDirecTV, one of the largest satellite television providers in the United States, has just announced a new price cut on their entry-level receiver to fend off competitors from the cable industry. The new move aims to entice more subscribers to switch to their service by offering a more affordable option for customers on a budget.\nThe entry-level DVR receiver, which typically costs $99, will now be available for just $49, representing a massive 50% price cut. The discount is available for all new customers who sign up for a DirecTV package with a two-year contract. The receiver allows users to record their favorite TV shows and movies and offers an easy-to-navigate user interface.\nThe move comes after several months of intense competition with rival cable providers who have been luring customers with more affordable options and bundling services such as internet and phone services together. DirecTV has been facing stiff competition from cable providers who are becoming increasingly popular due to their competitive pricing and faster internet speeds.\n\u201cThis latest price cut is part of our strategy to not only retain our existing customers, but to also attract new ones who may have been considering switching to a cable provider,\u201d said John Stankey, the CEO of AT&T, DirecTV\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that this offer will make our service more affordable and accessible to those who may have been on the fence about switching.\u201d\nThe move by DirecTV is also aimed at winning over cord-cutters, a demographic of customers who are moving away from traditional cable and satellite TV services in favor of streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. The new price cut will allow DirecTV to offer customers an affordable alternative without sacrificing the convenience and features of a traditional TV service.\nDirecTV has also recently launched new packages that include internet and phone services in an attempt to compete with cable providers who have been bundling their services for years. The service provider has also invested in more original programming and live sports events to attract customers who value exclusive content.\nDespite the price cut, some analysts are skeptical about the impact it will have on DirecTV\u2019s market share. \u201cWhile offering a more affordable option is a step in the right direction, it may not be enough to win over customers who are looking for a comprehensive internet, TV, and phone package,\u201d says Craig Johnson, an analyst with PwC. \u201cCable providers have been offering bundles for years, and DirecTV may have to come up with something even more competitive to win over customers.\u201d\nIn conclusion, DirecTV is taking a bold step to compete with cable providers by offering a more affordable option for customers on a budget. The move is aimed at winning over cord-cutters and retaining existing customers in the face of intense competition. While the price cut is a step in the right direction, DirecTV may need to innovate even further to stay ahead of its competitors in the ever-evolving television industry.", "British Biotech\u2019s Marimastat anti-cancer treatment will be reviewed at the upcoming European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) conference in Vienna. The topical gel-based treatment, originally developed to treat breast cancer, has shown promising results in clinical trials.\nMarimastat is a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, which means it targets enzymes that play a role in the growth and spread of cancer cells. In preclinical studies, it was shown to inhibit the growth of tumors and reduce the chances of metastasis.\nThe gel-based formulation allows the drug to be applied topically to the breast area, which could reduce the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy treatments. The treatment is applied using a patch, applied to the breast area daily for two weeks prior to surgery.\nThe phase II clinical trial conducted on 209 women with breast cancer showed a significant improvement in disease-free survival and overall survival rates. After three years, the patients who received Marimastat had a 35% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence compared to the placebo group.\nThe treatment also showed promise in delaying the progression of triple-negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form of the disease with limited treatment options. The results of the clinical trial were published in the Lancet Oncology journal earlier this year.\nProfessor Judith Bliss of the Institute of Cancer Research, one of the lead investigators of the clinical trial, commented: \"The results of this clinical trial demonstrate the potential of Marimastat to improve survival rates for women with breast cancer. It\u2019s exciting to see a novel treatment like Marimastat showing such promising results.\"\nThe ESMO conference, which is being held from 25th September to 29th September, brings together leading oncologists and medical professionals to discuss the latest developments in cancer treatments and research.\nThe review of Marimastat is expected to generate significant interest among the healthcare community, with the potential to open up a new avenue of treatment for breast cancer patients.\n\"Marimastat has the potential to make a real difference to the lives of millions of women around the world who are living with breast cancer,\" said Dr. Tom Bradshaw, CEO of British Biotech. \"We\u2019re thrilled to have the opportunity to present our findings at the ESMO conference and look forward to discussing the potential of Marimastat with the oncology community.\"\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with approximately 2.1 million new cases diagnosed each year. While traditional treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy have improved survival rates, they are often associated with significant side effects.\nThe potential for a topical gel-based treatment like Marimastat to offer a more targeted and less invasive treatment option is a significant development in the fight against breast cancer.\nThe review of Marimastat at the ESMO conference will provide an opportunity for healthcare professionals to consider the potential benefits of the treatment and to discuss the next steps in its development. With the prospect of improving survival rates for breast cancer patients, the potential of Marimastat is a beacon of hope for millions of women around the world.", "The Russian state-run energy company plans to increase its natural gas exports to Europe from the current 180 billion cubic meters annually to 360 billion cubic meters by 2035. The plan involves the construction of a massive pipeline network that will transport natural gas from Russia's Yamal Peninsula to Europe.\nThe Yamal pipeline project has been in the works for several years and is expected to be completed by 2024. It involves the construction of a 2,500 km pipeline network that will transport natural gas from Russia's Yamal Peninsula to Germany via Belarus and Poland. The project is part of Gazprom's broader plan to increase its natural gas exports to Europe and reduce its reliance on transit through Ukraine, which has been a source of political tension between Russia and Ukraine in recent years.\nHowever, energy analysts have cast doubt on Gazprom's ability to double its natural gas exports to Europe via the Yamal pipeline project. The skeptics argue that Gazprom's plan is overly ambitious given the current state of the European natural gas market and the increasing competition from other suppliers such as the United States and Qatar.\n\"The European natural gas market is already oversupplied, and there is little room for additional supply from Russia,\" said Gaurav Sharma, an independent energy analyst. \"Moreover, other suppliers such as the United States and Qatar are increasing their exports to Europe, which will further squeeze Gazprom's market share.\"\nSharma's skepticism is shared by other energy analysts who argue that Gazprom has not adequately factored in the impact of the growing competition from other suppliers on its plan to double its exports to Europe. Moreover, the analysts argue that Gazprom's plan assumes that the European natural gas market will continue to grow at the current rate, which may not necessarily be the case.\n\"The European natural gas market has been growing steadily over the past few years, but it may not continue to do so in the future,\" said Angelina Fernandes, an energy analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The growth in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar may reduce the demand for natural gas in the future, which will impact Gazprom's plan.\"\nGazprom has responded to the skepticism by arguing that its plan is based on a long-term view of the European natural gas market and takes into account the potential risks and challenges. The company has also pointed out that its natural gas exports to Europe have been growing steadily over the past few years, despite the increasing competition from other suppliers.\n\"We are confident that we can double our natural gas exports to Europe via the Yamal pipeline project by 2035,\" said Alexey Miller, Chairman of the Management Committee of Gazprom. \"We have a long-term view of the European natural gas market and are committed to meeting the growing demand for natural gas in the region.\"\nDespite the skepticism from energy analysts, Gazprom's plan to double its natural gas exports to Europe via the Yamal pipeline project remains on track. The project has the support of the Russian government, which sees it as a key strategic initiative to reduce the country's dependence on transit through Ukraine and increase its natural gas exports to Europe.\nIn conclusion, Gazprom's ambitious plan to double natural gas exports to Europe via the $40 billion Yamal pipeline project faces skepticism from energy analysts. While the project remains on track, its success is far from guaranteed given the increasing competition from other suppliers, the potential impact of renewable energy sources, and the uncertain future of the European natural gas market. Nevertheless, Gazprom remains committed to its plan and will continue to work towards meeting the growing demand for natural gas in Europe.", "PacifiCorp and Protection One have joined forces to offer security systems to customers across the United States. This collaboration was announced at a press conference held by both companies in Salt Lake City on Monday.\nThe deal will see PacifiCorp, which provides electricity to over 1.8 million customers in six western states, team up with Protection One, a leading provider of commercial and home security systems. PacifiCorp customers will now be able to purchase Protection One's advanced security products and services, which include alarm systems, surveillance cameras, and home automation.\nCommenting on the partnership, PacifiCorp's CEO, Stefan Bird, stated, \"This is an exciting opportunity for us to expand our range of products and services to our customers.

For instance, PacifiCorp customers who install a qualifying alarm system will receive a $100 credit on their energy bill, while those who opt for home automation services will receive a $50 credit.\nBoth companies are also committed to providing customers with round-the-clock customer support. This means that customers who require assistance with their security systems can contact Protection One's customer service team at any time of day or night.\nThe PacifiCorp and Protection One partnership comes at a time when the demand for security systems is growing rapidly across the country. With crime rates on the rise in many areas, more and more Americans are looking to invest in advanced security solutions to protect their homes and businesses.\nIndeed, a recent survey by the National Council for Home Safety and Security found that over 90% of all homebuyers consider security a top priority when purchasing a property. It is therefore likely that PacifiCorp customers will welcome the opportunity to take advantage of Protection One's services.\nIn conclusion, the PacifiCorp and Protection One partnership is set to bring enhanced security and peace of mind to customers across the region. With a range of advanced security products and services on offer, and incentives for customers who sign up, this collaboration is sure to be a success.", "Toronto stocks took a significant tumble on Thursday, September 9, due to a combination of profit-taking and gold sell-off. The slide was also attributed to the market\u2019s reaction to the lack of progress in U.S. stimulus talks. \nThe Toronto Stock Exchange\u2019s S&P/TSX composite index had fallen by 1.4%, or 253.22 points, to 20,792.05 at the end of the trading day. This was the lowest the benchmark has been in over two weeks, since August 24. \nAnalysts say that the sudden dip was caused by investors\u2019 persistent concerns over the global economic recovery. Additionally, the price of gold, a key component of Canada\u2019s primary equity index, fell sharply after a bounce in the US dollar\u2019s value. \nGold was down by almost 2% on the day, which saw the benchmark index fall below its support level of 21,000 points. Reports indicated that some big names in the Canadian mining industry dragged the market down, with players like Barrick Gold Corp and Kirkland Lake Gold both losing over 4% during the day. \nMeanwhile, Toronto-listed tech stocks also fell, including Blackberry Inc, which was down by almost 5%, and Shopify Inc, which lost nearly 4.3% by the end of Thursday's trading.\nDespite Thursday\u2019s sell-off, most major global stock markets remain near record-high levels. Analysts insist that investors need to focus on long-term trends and not be swayed by short-term volatility.\nThe recent outcome will doubtless prove frustrating for Canadian investors who had backed strong gains throughout the summer. Whether the market will bounce back soon or not remains to be seen, but experts are warning that investors should beware of further market turbulence as the pandemic\u2019s effects continue to play out. \nIn all, Thursday\u2019s plunge serves as a stark reminder that the stock market is inherently volatile, and investors need to remain vigilant and well-informed to navigate its twists and turns.", "In a move that is set to shake-up the telecommunications industry, MCI and BT recently announced their merger deal. The $18 billion USD all-stock agreement is expected to bolster News Corp's position in the global media market, as analysts predict the company will be a key beneficiary of the deal.\nNews Corp, a multinational mass media corporation, is the parent company of Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, and a host of other media businesses around the world. With a net worth of $8.4 billion USD, the company has long been a player in the media landscape, and the MCI-BT merger is seen as potentially increasing its power and influence.\nMany analysts are predicting that News Corp is set to benefit from the deal in several ways. Firstly, the merger of MCI and BT is expected to create a larger and more competitive telecommunications company with a global reach. This could lead to increased demand for News Corp's media offerings, as the new company seeks to expand its customer base and create new revenue streams.\nAdditionally, the merger of MCI and BT is seen as a positive development for News Corp's existing media portfolio. As another major player in the telecommunications industry, the merged company will likely have greater resources and reach, which could provide Advertisement and distribution opportunities for News Corp's news and entertainment businesses. This could include greater partnerships for sports broadcasting, streaming services, or even widespread subscription models.\nMoreover, News Corp's investment in the telecommunications sector could potentially pay off in other ways following the MCI-BT merger. The company has long held large stakes in satellite-TV provider Sky, as well as Australian telecoms giant Telstra. In particular, analysts predict that the Sky investment could benefit from the MCI-BT merger since Sky is a major distributor of BT Sports content. Any partnership between MCI and BT would make sense to leverage Sky for sports broadcasting globally. This would in turn boost Sky's reach for sports in overseas regions who could become potential BT-buying customers. News Corp's presence in both companies puts it in a strategic position to benefit from any increased demand for their services.\nOf course, there are concerns that the MCI-BT merger could negatively impact News Corp. The deal may give the new telecommunications company aggressive cost-cutting targets to meet, which could result in reduced content purchasing and slow ad growth access for News Corp's media products. Furthermore, BT Sports may look to expand or monetize in areas that may directly impact existing deals with Sky and News Corp might not be in the preferred position to acquire.\nPrecisely estimating any significant boost or downfall is currently difficult, and subject to change. However, one point that is not up for debate is the fact that the MCI-BT merger is an exceptional market development. Two media giants joining forces to create an even larger media powerhouse will, undoubtedly, have far-reaching implications for the entire industry.\nThe MCI-BT merger comes at a time of significant change for traditional media players, with the rise of digital streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime taking over a significant percentage of the traditional media market. Digital media disrupters have forced media corporations to reconfigure their business models and diversify their offerings, with many pursuing mergers, acquisitions, and other strategic partnerships. In this environment, the MCI-BT merger is a perfect example of a disruptive change and as with any industry changes, the players that come out on top will be those who can adapt quickly and cleverly to the new landscape.\nNews Corp sits in this category, and is positioning itself to benefit from the changes taking place in the media industry. With a strategic stake in one of the biggest cable providers worldwide, satellite-TV broadcasters and Australian telecoms giant, the company is well-placed to navigate a changing media landscape and capitalize on new opportunities. The MCI-BT merger will likely play a significant role in this, as it offers News Corp the potential for more partnerships and revenue streams that it can use to compete as the industry continues to evolve.\nOverall, while there are still unknown outcomes associated with the MCI-BT merger, most analysts agree that News Corp will probably benefit from it. Whether it is an increased global customer base, more abundant cross-promotional opportunities, or access to new technology, the merger offers several potential benefits for News Corp and puts the company in a strong position to capitalize on wider industry changes. Only time will tell how the industry landscape changes with such strategic mergers, but for now confidence in News Corp's future output runs high in influencer circles.", "Bre-X Minerals Ltd, a mining company based in Canada, made headlines recently after announcing a new strategic alliance with two mining companies in Indonesia. The move was met with mixed reactions from analysts, with some expressing concern for potential mining partners.\nAccording to the announcement made by Bre-X, the company has entered into a joint venture agreement with PT J Resources Asia Pasifik Tbk and PT Rajawali Corpora, two Indonesian mining firms. The agreement is intended to explore and develop four mining concession areas located in the East Java and East Kalimantan provinces of Indonesia.\nWhile the alliance is expected to bring financial benefits to Bre-X, some are worried that it may make it difficult for the company to secure future partnerships with other mining firms. This concern stems from the fact that PT Rajawali Corpora is owned by Peter Sondakh, a businessman who has a reputation for being difficult to work with.\n\"The fact that Bre-X has formed an alliance with PT Rajawali Corpora may be viewed as a red flag by other potential mining partners,\" said Albert Chow, an analyst at the Canadian Association of Mining Analysts. \"Sondakh is known for being extremely demanding and difficult to negotiate with. This could be a source of concern for other mining companies that may be interested in partnering with Bre-X in the future.\"\nOn the other hand, some analysts believe that the alliance may actually benefit Bre-X in the long run. They argue that the partnership will strengthen the company's position in the Indonesian mining industry and increase its chances of securing new partnerships.\n\"This strategic alliance with two respected Indonesian mining companies will help Bre-X establish a strong presence in the Indonesian market,\" said David Wang, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"This will put the company in a better position to negotiate with other potential mining partners in the future.\"\nBre-X has been working to expand its operations in Indonesia for several years now. The company currently has exploratory concessions in several provinces across the country, including Central and East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and West Timor.\nAccording to the company's website, Bre-X is focused on exploring and developing gold projects in Indonesia. The company aims to make significant discoveries that can be developed into profitable mining operations.\nBre-X has faced its fair share of controversies over the years. In the late 1990s, the company claimed to have discovered one of the largest gold deposits in history at its Busang mine in Indonesia. However, the discovery turned out to be fraudulent, and the company's shares plummeted, leading to the resignation of its CEO and the filing of several lawsuits.\nDespite this setback, Bre-X has continued to pursue its goal of becoming a leading player in the Indonesian mining industry. The new strategic alliance with PT J Resources Asia Pasifik Tbk and PT Rajawali Corpora is expected to play a key role in the company's future growth.\nOverall, the reaction to Bre-X's new strategic alliance has been mixed. While some are concerned about the potential difficulties of working with PT Rajawali Corpora, others see it as a positive move that will strengthen the company's position in the Indonesian market. Only time will tell how the partnership will ultimately affect Bre-X's future prospects.", "America Online (AOL), a leading provider of internet services, has reported a net loss of $353.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. The loss was mainly due to restructuring charges incurred by the company as it continued its efforts to streamline operations and focus on core business areas.\nAOL's revenue for the quarter was $511.4 million, compared to $520.9 million in the same period last year. The decline in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in advertising and search revenue, partially offset by growth in subscription revenue.\nThe company's CEO, Tim Armstrong, said that the first quarter was a challenging one for AOL, but that the company was making progress towards its long-term goals. \"We are taking the necessary steps to transform AOL into a more focused and efficient company, and I am confident that we will emerge stronger and more competitive in the years ahead,\" Armstrong said.\nAOL's restructuring efforts began last year with the announcement of a major shake-up of the company's organizational structure and the consolidation of its advertising and search businesses under a new entity called Oath. The move was aimed at simplifying operations and eliminating duplication in order to improve efficiency and profitability.\nHowever, the restructuring has come at a steep cost. In addition to the $353.7 million net loss, AOL also incurred $133 million in restructuring charges in the first quarter. The charges were related to severance and other expenses associated with the consolidation of the advertising and search businesses.\nDespite the losses, Armstrong insisted that the restructuring was necessary and that it would ultimately benefit the company in the long run. \"We are making tough decisions now that will position us for success in the future,\" he said.\nAOL's subscription business, which includes the AOL Desktop Gold and AOL Mail products, showed modest growth in the first quarter, with revenue increasing by 2% compared to the same period last year. However, the company's advertising and search businesses continued to struggle, with revenue declining by 9% and 7%, respectively.\nArmstrong acknowledged the challenges facing the company's advertising and search businesses, but said that AOL was taking steps to address the issues. \"We are working hard to improve our advertising and search offerings and to better meet the needs of our customers,\" he said.\nOne bright spot for AOL in the first quarter was the performance of its media properties, such as the Huffington Post and TechCrunch. The media business saw revenue growth of 4%, driven by higher advertising and sponsorship revenue.\nOverall, AOL's results for the first quarter were disappointing, but analysts said that the company's restructuring efforts should eventually pay off. \"AOL has been struggling for some time, but the restructuring is a step in the right direction,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"It may take some time for the benefits to become clear, but I think investors should be patient and give the company a chance to execute its plan.\"\nAOL's stock price has been relatively stable since the first quarter results were announced, suggesting that investors are taking a wait-and-see approach. The company's shares have traded between $38 and $43 in the weeks following the earnings release.\nLooking ahead, AOL faces significant challenges as it seeks to adapt to a rapidly changing market. The company will need to continue investing in new technologies and services in order to remain competitive, while also keeping a close eye on costs and profitability.\nArmstrong said that AOL was up to the challenge and that the company was well-positioned for the future. \"We have a strong brand, a talented team, and a clear strategy,\" he said. \"I am confident that we will succeed in the years ahead.\"", "ICI Australia, the leading manufacturer of chemicals and polymers, has reported a steep fall in profits for the past year. This has been largely attributed to the declining prices of plastics in the market. The fall in profits has taken the company by surprise, but it has not stopped them from setting their sights on a new market; Asia.\nThe CEO of ICI Australia, Ms. Sarah Stevens called the financial results, \"disappointing but not unexpected\". According to reports, the company's net profit fell by 27% to $265 million. This was due to the low demand for plastics in the face of increasing environmental concerns globally. ICI Australia has been grappling with the fallout of these environmental concerns that have driven demand for biodegradable materials. This led to the decline of traditional petrochemical-based plastic products, and the company has said it will now need to focus more on sustainable and renewable technologies to future proof their business.\nThe company's new strategy is already in motion, with plans to expand and diversify the product portfolio towards more eco-friendly materials. Their aim is to invest in plant-based polymers, recycled plastics, bio-based materials, and harnessing the potential of circular supply chains. Supply chains that focus on sustainable and eco-friendly practices have become essential for chemical companies such as ICI Australia, to satisfy customers who care about their environmental credibility.\nMs. Stevens said, \"For the next few years, we see a large growth opportunity in Asia and expect to capitalize on that market. Our strategic plan is to increase our customer base in the region as our Asia customer base continues to grow and as the demand for sustainable materials increase.\u201d\nAsia is known for its rapid industrialization and enormous demand for chemicals, which can be the catalyst for growth prospects. Allowing ICI Australia can leverage its technological capabilities to meet the pressing environmental needs of various parts of Asia. It is no secret that the continent of Asia, and especially China, has been facing a substantial pollution crisis. China's growing environmental awareness means sustainable products made by companies such as ICI will be in high demand giving them the opportunity to carve a niche in the market.\nMoreover, ICI Australia will aim to tap into rising spending power among consumers in Southeast Asia as middle classes in various regions increase their purchasing propensity. Within this context, the company can increase its customer base in collaborative partnerships, catering to the growing demand of petrochemical and plastics for industries such as automotive, construction and packaging.\nIn many parts of Asia, ICI's presence will mark its entry into an untapped market, bringing significant opportunities in an area that has avoided the global downturn of the past few years.\nIn conclusion, ICI Australia's fall in profits due to the declining demand in traditional petrochemical-based plastic products is not surprising given the environmental concerns looming large around the world. However, it presents an opportunity for the company to renew and rebrand with eco-friendly materials. With a strategic plan in place, ICI Australia has set its sights on Asia to capitalize on its growth opportunities as the demand for sustainable materials increase. The company's move towards sustainable products not only gives them a head start in Asia but also gives them moral ground to stand on and build better relationships with stakeholders who also care about the environment.", "In a sudden turn of events, one of Japan's leading real estate firms, Hiroshi Real Estate, is facing an involuntary bankruptcy. This comes as a major blow to the company, which has been struggling financially for months. The bankruptcy proceedings are expected to have far-reaching consequences for the Japanese financial system.\nHiroshi Real Estate, founded in 1980, has been a major player in the Japanese real estate market for nearly four decades. However, the company has been struggling with declining revenues and mounting debt for several years, due to an oversupply of housing and a sluggish economy. This has led to a situation where the company's liabilities far exceed its assets, and it is unable to meet its financial obligations.\nAs a result, several of Hiroshi Real Estate's creditors have petitioned the court to declare the company bankrupt. The court has accepted the petition, and the company is now facing involuntary bankruptcy. This means that the court will appoint a trustee to administer the company's assets and liabilities, and work towards settling its debts.\nHiroshi Real Estate's bankruptcy proceedings are expected to have a significant impact on the Japanese financial system. The company owes millions of yen to various banks, financial institutions, and individual investors, who may now be forced to write off their investments. This could lead to a domino effect, where creditors of other struggling companies also face losses, leading to a chain reaction of bankruptcies.\nMoreover, the bankruptcy proceedings are likely to create a ripple effect in the Japanese real estate market. The company owns several properties across the country, which will now be put up for sale to pay off its creditors. This could lead to a glut of properties in the market, further depressing property prices and exacerbating the oversupply problem.\nAnalysts say that the bankruptcy of Hiroshi Real Estate is indicative of wider issues in the Japanese economy, which has been grappling with slow growth, a declining population, and rising debt. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further worsened the economic situation, as businesses have shut down and consumer demand has plummeted.\nIn response to the crisis, the Japanese government has announced a stimulus package worth trillions of yen, aimed at reviving the economy and creating jobs. However, many experts believe that these measures may not be enough to address the structural issues that underlie the economy's woes.\nIn conclusion, the bankruptcy of Hiroshi Real Estate is a major setback for the Japanese financial system, and highlights the challenges facing the economy. The government and the financial sector will need to work together to find solutions to the underlying issues, and prevent a further deterioration of the economic situation.", "Italy has announced its intention to pursue integration rather than isolation for fringe candidates in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion. The move comes after last year\u2019s NATO summit where member states expressed concerns over the potential inclusion of fringe candidates in the alliance.\nItaly, as one of the founding members of NATO, has been instrumental in shaping the alliance\u2019s policies since its inception. The country has always been a strong proponent of NATO\u2019s enlargement, which has helped to contribute to the stability and security of Europe over the past few decades.\nHowever, as NATO expands, there have been concerns that the alliance risks adding member states that may undermine its core values and democratic principles. In particular, there have been concerns over the potential inclusion of fringe candidates such as Albania and North Macedonia, which have faced criticism over their human rights record and democratic practices.\nItaly has now taken a leading role in addressing these concerns by advocating for closer integration with these fringe candidates rather than isolating them from the rest of the alliance. This approach has been widely welcomed by NATO member states as a more effective way of promoting democracy and stability in the region.\nItalian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio stated: \u201cThe idea is that inclusion can lead to change. We have seen how NATO has been instrumental in promoting democracy and stability, and we believe that by continuing to expand the alliance, we can help bring about positive change in our region.\u201d\nItaly\u2019s approach has been praised by other NATO member states, who view it as a more pragmatic and effective approach to dealing with fringe candidates. Germany, in particular, has expressed its support for Italy\u2019s position, with its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, stating that \u201cNATO\u2019s expansion should be based on shared values.\u201d\nThe European Union has also expressed its support for Italy\u2019s approach, with its foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, stating that \u201cthe EU and NATO share common values and principles, and we believe that these values should guide any expansion of the alliance.\u201d\nThe move by Italy to pursue integration rather than isolation for fringe candidates has been seen by many as a reflection of its broader foreign policy objectives. Italy has long been committed to promoting stability and prosperity in the Balkans, and its approach to NATO expansion is seen as an extension of this policy.\nItaly has also been at the forefront of seeking closer ties with Russia, despite concerns over its aggressive tactics in the region. This has led to some criticism from other NATO member states, who view Italy\u2019s overtures to Russia as undermining the alliance\u2019s cohesion and credibility.\nHowever, Italy has defended its position, arguing that engagement with Russia is necessary to maintain stability in the region. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte stated: \u201cWe believe that dialogue with Russia is essential for maintaining peace and security in Europe. We do not see Russia as a threat, but rather as a partner.\u201d\nDespite these differences in approach, Italy\u2019s commitment to NATO expansion and its efforts to promote stability and democracy in the region have been widely praised by its allies. As NATO continues to expand, Italy\u2019s leadership on this issue is likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the future direction of the alliance.\nIn conclusion, Italy\u2019s decision to pursue integration rather than isolation for fringe candidates in NATO expansion is a positive development for the alliance and a reflection of its commitment to promoting democracy, stability, and prosperity in the region. While there may be differences in approach among member states, their shared commitment to these principles will likely serve as a foundation for the continued strength and cohesion of NATO in the years to come.", "RGC Ltd doubles annual operating profit on the back of strong demand for aircraft and golf clubs\nRGC Ltd, a leading manufacturer of aircraft and golf clubs, has announced that its annual operating profit has doubled despite the ongoing global economic uncertainty. The company has attributed the growth largely to strong demand for its products, which have continued to perform well in the current market conditions.\nAccording to the company\u2019s financial statements for the year ending March 31, 2021, RGC Ltd generated an operating profit of \u00a320 million, up from \u00a310 million the previous year. This increase in profits came in spite of a slight drop in revenue, which stood at \u00a3450 million for the year, down from \u00a3500 million the previous year.\nRGC Ltd\u2019s CEO, John Smith, attributed the success to a number of factors. \u201cThe last year has been one of the most challenging our company has faced, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic causing significant disruption to our operations. However, we have been able to respond to these challenges by making some tough decisions and adapting to the changing market conditions. We have also invested heavily in new product development, which has helped to drive growth in key areas such as aircraft and golf clubs.\u201d\nSmith also noted that the company\u2019s focus on innovation has played a key role in its success. \u201cOur R&D team has been working hard to develop new products that meet the needs of our customers. This has included the launch of several new aircraft models and golf club designs that have been very well received by the market. We have also invested in new manufacturing technology and processes that have helped to drive efficiencies and reduce costs.\u201d\nIn addition to its success in the aircraft and golf club markets, RGC Ltd has also been making progress in other areas. The company has been expanding its presence in the electric vehicle sector, with the launch of several new products in this area.

We are also committed to expanding our global footprint and strengthening our partnerships with key customers and suppliers.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cOf course, there are still challenges ahead. The ongoing pandemic, as well as other economic and geopolitical factors, will continue to pose risks to our business. However, we believe that our strong financial position and our focus on innovation and customer service will help us to navigate these challenges and continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders and stakeholders.\u201d\nOverall, RGC Ltd\u2019s success in doubling its annual operating profit is a testament to the company\u2019s resilience, innovation, and commitment to quality and customer service. With a strong track record of performance and a forward-looking strategy, the company is well-positioned for continued growth and success in the years ahead.", "The relationship between Britain and China is being tested once again, this time over the future of Hong Kong. The Chinese government has proposed a new law on subversion in Hong Kong, which has sparked concerns from the international community over the erosion of the territory's autonomy and civil liberties.\nThe proposed law, which is expected to be passed by the National People's Congress on Thursday, aims to prevent and punish acts of subversion, secession, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces that endanger national security. It would also allow Chinese security agencies to operate in Hong Kong, bypassing the territory's legal system.\nThe move has triggered protests from Hong Kongers who fear the new law would undermine their freedoms and human rights, including the right to free speech, assembly, and protest. They see it as a direct attack on their autonomy, which was promised under the \"one country, two systems\" agreement that was signed in 1997 when Hong Kong was handed over to China by Britain.\nThe Hong Kong government has tried to calm the fears of its citizens by saying the law would only target a small number of people who pose a threat to national security and that it would not affect the majority of Hong Kongers' regular life and work. But such reassurances have done little to ease the concerns of the people who believe they are facing an authoritarian regime that is tightening its grip on the territory.\nThe proposed law has also raised tensions between Britain and China, as the former colonial power has expressed its opposition to the Chinese move. Britain has accused China of breaching the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the agreement that guaranteed Hong Kong's autonomy for 50 years after the handover. The UK has promised to give a path to citizenship to around three million Hong Kongers, who are eligible for British National Overseas (BNO) passports, if the law is passed.\nThe proposal has been met with a strong response from China, which sees it as interference in its internal affairs. Chinese officials have accused Britain of colonial-era hypocrisy and meddling in China's sovereignty. They have warned of retaliation if the UK offers citizenship to Hong Kongers, saying it would amount to violating China's territorial integrity and sovereignty.\nThe standoff between Britain and China over Hong Kong has sparked concerns among the international community over a potential new Cold War between the West and China. Countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have expressed their support for Britain's stance on Hong Kong and criticized China's move as a threat to regional stability and international order.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has called on China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and to avoid using the proposed law to suppress political opposition and dissent.\nThe proposed law on subversion is just the latest flashpoint in the long-standing tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China. The pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, which began in 2019 in response to a proposed extradition law, has been met with increasing repression from the Hong Kong police and the Chinese government.\nThe new law on subversion, if passed, would give the Chinese government even more power to clamp down on dissent and opposition in Hong Kong. It would also send a chilling message to other regions in China, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, that the Chinese government will not tolerate any form of challenge to its authority.\nThe future of Hong Kong remains uncertain, as the Chinese government appears determined to assert its authority over the territory, and the people of Hong Kong continue to fight for their autonomy and freedoms. The standoff between Britain and China over Hong Kong is just one aspect of a broader struggle between the West and China over global power and influence.\nWhatever the outcome of this latest dispute, it is clear that the people of Hong Kong need the support and solidarity of the international community to defend their rights and freedoms against an increasingly repressive regime that threatens to engulf them.", "China has decided to ban the import of poultry products from 10 different states from the United States due to concerns about avian influenza or fowl plague. The Chinese government's decision to take drastic action on imports reflects its concern about the animals' health and the potential risk to human health. \nThe 10 states affected are Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota and South Dakota. The US is considered to be the world's biggest poultry producer and exporter of poultry products. However, the Chinese move to ban the import of poultry products could seriously affect the US economy, as China is one of the largest buyers of US poultry products. \nThe ban on the import of US poultry products can be traced back to the discovery of a strain of H5N8 bird flu in several US states. According to officials, the bird flu outbreak in the United States has left tens of thousands of birds dead and led to enormous losses for poultry farmers and companies. \nIn response to China's decision, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has released a statement communicating its disappointment and describing the ban as unwarranted, as it is focused on areas where the disease has not been detected. The USDA has also stated that it is continuing to monitor the disease in the States affected and is committed to working with its trading partners to minimize the impact of such events on international trade. \nChina's decision to impose the ban on poultry imports from the States came after one Chinese company found traces of Covid-19 on the packaging of imported frozen chicken wings from Brazil. This has led to the Chinese government to carry out inspections of all imported frozen food products, which has impacted many of the world's leading food suppliers. \nAccording to a statement by the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation, importers of frozen food must provide certification before their products are allowed into the country. The Chinese authorities have reiterated the need to take measures to prevent the risk of infectious diseases, including Covid-19, being introduced through imported food products.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of food safety and security in most countries. China's decision to ban imports of US poultry products may be seen by many as a prudent decision based on concerns about the introduction of new, infectious diseases. However, it comes at a time when both countries are trying to rebuild their economies after the pandemic's economic impact. \nThe US is already feeling the effects of the Chinese ban on US poultry products, as the price of chicken has significantly decreased as a result. In recent years, the Chinese market has been crucial for US poultry farmers who have been ramping up production to meet the increasing demand for meat in Asia. The ban could result in a loss of over $1 billion a year for US poultry companies, who are already struggling with low margins due to the pandemic. \nIn conclusion, China's decision to ban poultry imports from the US could not have come at a worse time for the American poultry industry. The outbreak of avian influenza has put many farmers out of business, and now China's decision has dealt a further blow. The authorities in China have cited health and safety concerns as the reason for their decision, but the economic impact on the US should not be underestimated. The situation is likely to test the limit of the trading relationship between the US and China and will require careful and innovative policy responses from both sides.", "Highland Distilleries, the parent company of Famous Grouse, has announced a 14% dip in profit for the first half of 2021, largely due to lower sales of the Scotch whisky brand in the UK. The news sent shockwaves through the whisky industry as Famous Grouse has long been the top-selling blended whisky in Scotland.\nThe company said that overall revenue fell 9% to \u00a332.6m in the six months to 31 March, compared with \u00a335.9m in the same period last year. The decline in sales of Famous Grouse was partly due to ongoing challenges related to Brexit and Covid-19 restrictions but also due to increased competition from rival brands.\nDespite this setback, the company is confident that it can bounce back in the second half of the year, with a range of new products planned for release in the coming months. These include a new premium single malt called The Glenrothes, which will be launched in August 2021.\nIn a statement, Highland Distilleries CEO, Gordon Buist, said: \"We are disappointed to report a dip in profits for the first half of the year, but we remain optimistic about the future. Our brands have a strong reputation in markets around the world and we continue to invest in new product development to meet changing consumer demands.\"\nFamous Grouse is not the only whisky brand to have struggled in the UK market recently. Other popular brands such as Johnnie Walker and Bell's have also seen declining sales, amid changing consumer preferences and increased competition.\nDespite these challenges, the whisky industry remains an important contributor to the Scottish economy, generating around \u00a36bn in annual revenue and employing more than 10,000 people. Highland Distilleries is one of the largest employers in Scotland, with a workforce of around 1,500 people.\nThe company is hoping that the launch of The Glenrothes will help to boost sales in the second half of the year. The new single malt is named after the distillery in Speyside where it is produced and is aimed at a more premium market segment.\nHighland Distilleries is also investing heavily in marketing, with a new advertising campaign for Famous Grouse set to launch in the coming months. The campaign will focus on the brand's Scottish heritage and will feature a range of new products, including a limited-edition bottling of Famous Grouse made in collaboration with Edinburgh-based artist Peter Doig.\nDespite the challenges posed by Brexit and Covid-19, the whisky industry remains a key part of Scotland's economy and is set to play an important role in the country's economic recovery in the aftermath of the pandemic. As Highland Distilleries and other brands continue to invest in new products and marketing, the future looks bright for the industry as a whole.", "Frontier Corp, a leading telecommunications company, has recently announced its plans to invest $500 million in a new $2 billion fiber optic network across the United States.

The new network will also help to improve the reliability of the company's services and reduce downtime for its customers.\nThe initial rollout of the new network is expected to be in major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and will gradually expand to cover rural areas where internet connectivity is still a challenge. The aim is to ensure that the network reaches as many customers as possible, regardless of their location.\nThe company's investment in the new network is also expected to create new job opportunities across the country, ranging from construction and engineering to sales and customer support. The expansion will not only help to improve the quality of life for customers in the areas serviced, but will also help to stimulate local economies through job creation and growth.\nIn conclusion, Frontier Corp's investment in the new $2 billion fiber optic network is not only a significant milestone for the company, but for the entire telecommunications industry. The new network will improve the quality of services provided by the company, enhance connectivity for millions of customers, and boost economic growth by creating new job opportunities.", "Canadian consumers should prepare to be scrooge-like once again during this holiday season, according to a recent survey conducted by the Retail Council of Canada. The survey revealed that consumers plan on cutting back on holiday spending as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe survey found that 62 percent of shoppers plan to spend less on holiday gifts and celebrations in 2020 than they did in 2019. The majority cited financial concerns and the impact of the pandemic on their budgets as the main reasons for their reduced spending plans.\nMany Canadians are experiencing financial hardship due to the economic fallout of the pandemic, and are therefore prioritizing essential expenses such as rent and groceries over discretionary spending. The survey found that 52 percent of respondents felt that their ability to spend on holiday gifts had been compromised by the pandemic, with 24 percent of those surveyed saying that their finances had been significantly impacted by the crisis.\nThe Retail Council of Canada predicts that holiday spending will decrease by approximately 20 percent this year, representing a loss of billions of dollars for the retail sector. Many retailers are facing significant challenges, as they rely heavily on sales during the holiday season to generate revenue and profit.\nDespite the challenging economic environment, retailers are adapting quickly to meet the needs of consumers in the new normal. Many are pivoting to online sales and adopting new safety measures to ensure that customers feel comfortable shopping in-person.\nThe holiday season is typically a time to bring cheer and joy to loved ones, but the pandemic has made this year exceptionally difficult for many Canadians. However, with the right balance of patience, creativity, and kindness, we can still find ways to connect with one another and make the most of this festive season.", "The Bank of Scotland's recent announcement of its joint venture with J Sainsbury has been met with positive feedback from analysts in the UK banking sector.\nThe partnership, which was officially revealed yesterday, sees the Bank of Scotland investing \u00a3370 million into Sainsbury\u2019s Bank, in a move that is designed to boost the supermarket giant's financial services division.\nAnalysts have praised the move as a shrewd one on the part of both companies, with many noting how much sense the partnership makes.\nOne of those positive voices was Finlay George, an analyst at Edinburgh-based firm Noble Grossart. George believes that the move is a sign of a growing trend in the banking industry, where investment and collaboration with other financial services providers is becoming increasingly popular.\n\"Sainsbury's Bank has been undergoing something of a revival in recent years and this partnership with Bank of Scotland is a smart example of how twocompanies can come together to achieve mutually beneficial results,\" he said.\nOther analysts also weighed in, with many pointing out the benefits of the partnership for both parties. Sainsbury's will gain access to a wealth of banking expertise and resources, while Bank of Scotland will have a strategic foothold in the highly lucrative retail banking sector.\nIndeed, it is this retail banking sector where Sainsbury's Bank has been making great strides in recent years. Its latest financial results highlighted how the bank's customer lending had increased by 12% year-on-year, while customer deposits grew by 10%.\nGavin French, head of personal finance at Sainsbury's Bank, also noted that the Bank of Scotland deal will help strengthen its product offerings.\n\"This deal will give us the opportunity to bring more financial products and services to our customers and build on the success we've already achieved in the financial services world,\" he said.\nThe move will no doubt be welcomed by Sainsbury's shareholders, who have seen the supermarket gradually diversify its business offerings in recent years.\nThe retailer has already made moves into areas such as clothing, electricals, and even mortgages, as it seeks to build a more diversified and profitable business.\nThe deal with Bank of Scotland will further support that strategy, as it allows Sainsbury's to offer a wider range of financial services to its customers, while also opening up new revenue streams for both companies.\nOverall, it's clear that both companies stand to benefit from this partnership. Analysts are confident that it will open up new opportunities and drive growth in the retail banking space, which continues to be a key area of focus for many firms.\nIt remains to be seen how the deal will play out, but for now, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with both Sainsbury's and Bank of Scotland looking set to benefit from this exciting new partnership.", "Air France is gearing up to take on its British rival, British Airways, in the domestic market, with the launch of its new domestic service, HOP! Air France. The new airline will offer flights to and from 50 destinations across France, with the aim of capturing a share of the lucrative market currently dominated by British Airways.\nThe launch of HOP! Air France is a major step forward for the French airline, which has struggled to compete with British Airways on many routes in Europe. However, with the backing of its parent company, Air France-KLM, the new airline is expected to make significant inroads into the domestic market, offering a range of services and prices to suit different customer needs.\nThe move by Air France comes as the French airline industry struggles with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. With travel restrictions in place and many countries imposing strict quarantine measures, air travel has been severely impacted, leading to a sharp decline in revenue for airlines across the world.\nBut despite the challenges facing the industry, Air France is confident that its new domestic service will be successful. The airline has invested heavily in the project, launching a major advertising campaign to promote HOP! Air France, and offering a range of different fares to appeal to different passengers.\nThe airline has also worked closely with other companies in the travel industry to create a seamless travel experience for passengers. For example, customers can book their flights through the airline's website, and then use a special baggage and ticketing system to transfer to other flights with other airlines.\nThe launch of HOP! Air France represents a significant challenge for British Airways, which already faces stiff competition from other carriers in the French market. However, with its established route network and strong brand, British Airways is expected to fight hard to retain its place as the leading domestic airline in the country.\nAt the heart of the battle between the two airlines is the fight for the British and French business and leisure traveler. Both airlines are hoping to capture a share of this lucrative market, which generates billions of pounds in revenue each year.\nFor Air France, this represents a major opportunity to increase its market share and become a dominant player in the domestic market. The airline has already made significant strides in recent years, strengthening its position in international markets and expanding its route network across Europe and beyond.\nHowever, for British Airways, the emergence of a new domestic competitor represents a serious threat. The airline has already been hit hard by the pandemic, and now faces the prospect of losing a significant share of its domestic market to a new and aggressive competitor.\nBut despite the challenges facing the industry, both airlines remain optimistic about the future. With passenger numbers expected to rebound in the coming years, the domestic market is expected to remain highly competitive, with both airlines battling it out for supremacy.\nOverall, the launch of HOP! Air France represents a major step forward for the French airline industry, which has struggled to compete with British Airways and other carriers in recent years. However, with its strong brand, vast network, and commitment to customer service, Air France is well positioned to make significant inroads into the domestic market, providing a range of affordable and reliable services to passengers across France.", "The former chairman of Wickes, Michael Ashcroft, has accepted responsibility for accounting irregularities that led to a write-off of \u00a351 million. The announcement was made on Monday, June 28th, by Wickes\u2019 parent company, Travis Perkins, who also confirmed that they have reached a settlement with Ashcroft.\nThe accounting irregularities were uncovered during an internal review in 2019, which led to Wickes restating its profits for the previous two years. In March 2020, Travis Perkins announced a \u00a351 million write-off, which included \u00a329 million in stock losses and a \u00a322 million charge relating to accounting irregularities.\nSpeaking on the settlement, Wickes\u2019 CEO, David Wood, stated that it would \u201cdraw a line under these issues and allow us to move forward with confidence.\u201d He also praised the work of Wickes\u2019 employees during the past months, stating that they had \u201cworked tirelessly to rebuild trust with our customers and partners.\u201d\nThe financial irregularities occurred during Ashcroft\u2019s tenure as chairman of Wickes, between 2015 and 2018. In a statement, he admitted that he was \u201cdisappointed and regretful\u201d that they happened on his watch.

In May 2021, the company reported that its trading performance had exceeded expectations, with the Wickes division being a standout performer.\nDespite this positive news, Travis Perkins\u2019 share price has been sluggish in recent months, as investors remain cautious about the economic outlook and the impact of Covid-19 on the UK\u2019s construction sector. However, analysts are optimistic about the company\u2019s future, with many predicting that it will continue to benefit from the current boom in DIY and home improvement.\nThe settlement with Ashcroft is also a reminder of the importance of corporate governance and the need for companies to take responsibility for their actions. As the UK\u2019s economy continues to recover from the impact of Covid-19, investors will be looking for companies that can demonstrate transparency, accountability, and strong leadership.\nIn conclusion, the settlement between Wickes\u2019 parent company, Travis Perkins, and former chairman Michael Ashcroft is a significant development in the ongoing fallout from the company\u2019s accounting irregularities. While it is a reminder of the importance of corporate governance, it also highlights the resilience of the UK\u2019s construction sector in the face of economic uncertainty. Wickes is now well-positioned to capitalize on the current boom in DIY and home improvement, and Travis Perkins can move forward with confidence.", "Scottish Amicable, a life insurance company based in Scotland, has announced that it will provide its policyholders with crucial information regarding Abbey National's bid during its demutualisation proposal announcement.

Inc. announced today its plans to acquire Big B Inc., a regional drugstore chain with over 150 stores in the Midwest, in a sweetened takeover deal worth $380 million. The acquisition is expected to further expand Revco's presence in the region and diversify its product offerings.\nThe deal includes both cash and Revco stock, with Big B shareholders receiving $25 per share in cash and the remainder in Revco stock. The new offer is significantly higher than Revco's initial bid of $300 million, which was rejected by Big B's board of directors as undervalued.\n\"Big B is a well-respected and established brand in the Midwest, and we are thrilled to be bringing them under our umbrella,\" said Ed Jankowski, CEO of Revco. \"This acquisition will allow us to offer our customers an even wider range of products and services, while expanding our footprint in this important market.\"\nThe deal is expected to close in the next several months, pending regulatory approval. Revco has stated that it intends to retain most of Big B's employees and maintain the chain's current branding and operations.\nNews of the acquisition sent shares of Revco up over 5% in early trading, as investors reacted positively to the news. Analysts praised the move as a strategic one for the company, as it allows them to tap into a new customer base and increase market share.\n\"The Midwest is a key market for drugstores, and this deal gives Revco a strong foothold in the region,\" said John Wilson, an analyst at Morningstar. \"It also helps them differentiate themselves from competitors by expanding their offerings beyond just pharmaceuticals.\"\nBig B was founded in 1973 and has since grown into one of the largest privately owned drugstore chains in the Midwest. The company is known for its focus on customer service and friendly, local feel. The chain offers a wide range of products, including over-the-counter medications, health and beauty products, and household essentials.\n\"We are excited to be joining forces with Revco and believe that this deal will benefit both our customers and our employees,\" said Linda Schmidt, CEO of Big B. \"Revco brings with it a wealth of experience and resources, and we look forward to working together to grow our business and serve our communities.\"\nThe acquisition comes amid a wave of consolidation in the retail pharmacy industry, driven in part by rising healthcare costs and increased competition from online retailers. In recent years, an increasing number of smaller regional chains have been acquired by larger national players, including CVS and Walgreens.\nHowever, some analysts have raised concerns about the impact of these mergers on consumers, particularly in terms of pricing and access to healthcare. A recent report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance found that the rise of national pharmacy chains had led to a decline in independent pharmacies, reducing competition and increasing prices for consumers.\n\"We need to be vigilant about the effects of consolidation in this industry, particularly in terms of its impact on consumer choice and access to healthcare,\" said Wilson. \"While this deal may be positive for Revco in the short term, we need to ensure that it doesn't have negative long-term effects for consumers and the broader healthcare system.\"\nDespite these concerns, Revco remains optimistic about the future of the retail pharmacy industry and its role in it. The company has said that it plans to continue expanding through strategic acquisitions and investment in new products and technology.\n\"This is an exciting time for us and for the industry as a whole,\" said Jankowski. \"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service and keeping up with the latest trends and innovations in the field. With our acquisition of Big B, we are taking another important step in that direction.\"", "United News & Media has acquired Blenheim, a leading trade exhibition group, creating the world's largest trade exhibition group.

The company reported a strong growth in sales revenue and profitability, defying the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.\nCisco's revenue for Q1 2022 stood at $13.2 billion, indicating a 7% year-on-year increase compared to Q1 2021. The company's net income for the same period was reported at $3.1 billion, which represents a remarkable 77% increase in profit from operations.\nThis impressive financial performance was driven by the sustained demand in the company's core businesses of data center, security, and applications. Sales in the applications segment were particularly strong, witnessing a growth of 11% to $1.5 billion. The company's infrastructure platforms division, which includes switching, routing, data center networking, and wireless services segments, also grew 6% for the first quarter year-over-year, creating a strong foundation for further growth.\n\"We had a great start to our fiscal year 2022 as we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth and profitability amid an ongoing challenging business environment,\" said Chuck Robbins, Chairman and CEO of Cisco. \"Our continued momentum reflects our ability to execute on our growth strategy, meet customers' evolving needs with an unmatched portfolio of innovative solutions, and drive operational excellence,\" he added.\nMr. Robbins also expressed his optimism for continued growth in the coming quarters, benefiting from the strategic investments made by Cisco in the development of new products and services that will help customers to navigate the evolving technology landscape.\nCisco's success in the first quarter was not limited to the USA.

With a solid foundation for growth, Cisco is well-positioned to continue its impressive performance in the coming quarters.", "Airbus has set its sights for soaring heights in 1996, thanks to a bumper order from US carrier, USAir. The order for 121 new aircrafts is valued at $6.6 billion, and it's enough for the European jet maker to break the 1,000-order barrier that surpasses American arch-rival Boeing. The decision comes as a significant boost for Airbus as it continues to grow as a major global competitor.\nThe order is set to include A319, A320 and A321 models of aircraft, and it's a blow for Boeing, which has traditionally dominated the US markets for many decades. USAir stated that it chose Airbus for the flexibility it offered with the broad range of aircraft models available that could suit various routes and operational requirements.\nThe news of the order has been met with excitement in the aviation industry as this further cements Airbus' position as the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. As it stands, the company is responsible for more than 30% of the global market for commercial airline production. The brand's primary strength lies in its product diversity, which allows it to meet individual aircraft requirements of airlines across the world.\nHowever, Airbus still has some significant decisions to make cautiously in 1996. With flexibility comes complexity, and Airbus will have to stay on top of the game, developing its products to meet the ever-changing market needs. The company will need to manage its investments and focus as it positions itself for growth and expansion worldwide.\nAnother critical decision the company faces is the question of ownership and governance. As Airbus continues to emerge as a front-runner in the aviation market, shareholders are seeking clarity over its ownership structure. The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS) and British defence company BAE Systems currently hold significant stakes in the company.\nHowever, the French government owns shares as well, and with elections looming, Francois Mitterrand's successor could shift the political landscape for the aviation company. It emerges that the more minor shareholders are looking for a more transparent ownership structure and a less complex legal entity. There have been calls for EADS to buy out BAE Systems and take full control of Airbus, but this is yet to materialize.\nAirbus has been making great strides and major gains in the Asian markets, particularly in China. However, the question of ownership has become more pressing as the company continues to expand globally. Airbus will need to ensure that it stays ahead of competition in China, maintaining a strong relationship with this key market as it looks to penetrate deeper into the aviation industry.\nThe Chinese make up for a significant chunk of the global economy, and their aviation market is set to become the world's largest in the next few years. They are also looking to grow their defense industry, as well as their aircraft manufacturing. Airbus will need to be on its toes to take advantage of this developing market and stay ahead of the curve.\nOverall, Airbus looks set to continue its upward trajectory, and the bumper order by USAir will only serve to cement its position as the world's leading aircraft manufacturer. However, it will need to stay vigilant and keep ahead of the game if it is to secure its position. With competition from Boeing always looming, Airbus must ensure that it continues to diversify its products in response to market needs and maintain close relationships with emerging markets such as China.\nOn the question of ownership, Airbus will need to develop a more transparent and open structure that gives shareholders the clarity and transparency they seek. As the political landscape around the company shifts, how it manages its ownership structure will become increasingly important, and Airbus will need to manage its investors' expectations and make tough decisions to position itself for success in 1996 and beyond.", "In the wake of Ford's recent announcement that it plans to cut thousands of jobs in Europe and close several factories, industry analysts are predicting a long and difficult road ahead for the American automaker as it looks to cut costs and revive its product line in the region.\nThe move comes as part of a wider restructuring effort aimed at improving profitability and competitiveness for Ford, which has struggled to keep pace with competitors in Europe's highly competitive automotive market.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the company as it seeks to make these changes is the cost of labor. Labor costs in Europe are generally higher than they are in Asia or North America, and this has been a major factor in Ford's struggles to remain competitive in the region.\nThe company's decision to close several plants and cut jobs is aimed at reducing these costs, but it will not be an easy process. Many of the company's employees are unionized, and there will likely be significant resistance to any job cuts or plant closures.\nAnother challenge facing Ford is the changing nature of the European automotive market. In recent years, there has been a shift towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, as consumers have become more environmentally conscious and concerned about rising gasoline prices.\nThis trend has not been good news for Ford, whose product line is skewed heavily towards larger vehicles, such as SUVs and pickup trucks. To remain competitive in the European market, Ford will need to shift its product mix towards smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, which can be a costly and time-consuming process.\nIn addition to these challenges, Ford will also need to contend with increasing regulatory scrutiny. The European Union has been pushing for tighter emissions standards, which will require automakers to develop more environmentally-friendly vehicles.\nThis is likely to be a major challenge for Ford, which has traditionally focused more on building powerful, high-performance vehicles than on developing environmentally-friendly cars.\nDespite these challenges, some analysts believe that Ford can turn things around in Europe. The company has a long history of innovation and success in the region, and it has a strong brand and loyal customer base.\nTo succeed, however, Ford will need to be willing to make some tough decisions and invest heavily in new technologies and products. It will also need to work closely with regulators and government officials to ensure that it is complying with all relevant regulations and standards.\nThe company will also need to focus on building partnerships with other automakers and suppliers, as well as on developing new distribution channels and marketing strategies.\nDespite the challenges facing the company in Europe, Ford remains confident in its long-term prospects. In a recent statement, company executives emphasized their commitment to the region and their belief that they have the tools and expertise necessary to succeed.\n\"We have a clear strategy for Europe, which is to deliver a sustainable, profitable business that can continue to deliver world-class vehicles for our customers,\" said Steven Armstrong, group vice president and president, Europe, Middle East and Africa for Ford.\n\"We are making tough decisions to help us achieve this goal, but we are confident that we have the right team and the right plan in place to succeed in this highly competitive market,\" he added.\nOverall, the road ahead for Ford in Europe is likely to be a long and difficult one. But with the right strategy, investment, and commitment, there is reason to believe that the company can turn things around and regain its position as a leading player in the region's automotive market.", "Exploration companies in Northern Ontario's ageing gold zone are enjoying a resurgence in production, thanks to advancements in mining technology, according to a recent report. The area, which was once a major hub of gold mining activity, fell out of favour decades ago, as the supply of easily accessible gold deposits dwindled.\nHowever, recent exploration efforts have been yielding encouraging results, with several companies reporting significant discoveries in the area. One such company is Vancouver-based Great Bear Resources, which announced the discovery of a new gold zone last month. The company's Dixie Project is located near the town of Red Lake, about 180 kilometres northwest of Timmins.\nGreat Bear Resources reported that the new gold zone, called the Auro Zone, could be part of a larger deposit, which could greatly increase the value of the company's property. \"This discovery opens up a new area for follow-up drilling, which will be critical in determining the extent of the gold mineralization,\" said Chris Taylor, Great Bear's president and CEO.\nOther exploration companies in the area, such as Probe Metals and Pure Gold Mining, have also reported significant discoveries. \"These new discoveries highlight the significant potential for gold in the Timmins area,\" said Michael Schillaci, Executive Director of the Timmins Economic Development Corporation. \"Investor interest in the area is increasing, and we expect to see more exploration activity in the future.\"\nThe resurgence in mining activity in Northern Ontario is being driven by advancements in mining technology. In particular, the use of geophysics has enabled exploration companies to identify potential gold deposits with much greater accuracy and efficiency than before. \"Geophysics has definitely revolutionized the way we explore for gold,\" said Schillaci.\nHowever, there are some concerns about the environmental impact of increased mining activity in the area. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment has voiced concerns about the potential for increased water pollution and the destruction of sensitive ecosystems. \"We take our responsibility to protect the environment very seriously,\" said Schillaci. \"There are strict regulations in place to ensure that mining activity does not harm the environment.\"\nDespite these concerns, the economic benefits of increased mining activity in Northern Ontario are significant. According to a report from the Mining Association of Canada, the mining industry in Ontario employs more than 70,000 people and contributes over $10 billion to the province's GDP each year. \"Mining is a vital part of the Northern Ontario economy, and we welcome the resurgence in mining activity in the area,\" said Schillaci.\nSeveral local businesses are already reaping the benefits of increased mining activity. \"There's been a noticeable uptick in business since the exploration companies started moving back into the area,\" said John Smith, owner of a local restaurant. \"We're seeing more miners and exploration workers coming through, and they're spending money in the community.\"\nThe resurgence in mining activity in Northern Ontario is a welcome development for a region that has struggled economically in recent years. With the supply of easily accessible gold deposits dwindling, many in the area had feared that the mining industry would never recover. However, the recent discoveries by exploration companies in the area have breathed new life into a once-thriving industry.\nAs the exploration companies continue their search for gold in Northern Ontario's ageing gold zone, it remains to be seen whether the area can once again become a major hub of mining activity. However, the recent discoveries suggest that there is still plenty of gold to be found in the area, and that the mining industry in Northern Ontario has a bright future ahead.", "The Justice Department has filed a petition with the Supreme Court, requesting them to lift the suspension of federal rules that opened the local phone market to competition. The move is seen as a significant step towards ensuring affordable access to local telephone services for millions of Americans.\nThe federal rules in question were introduced in 1996 as part of the Telecommunications Act, which aimed to break down the long-standing monopolies in the local telephone industry. Under these rules, incumbent telephone companies were obliged to open their networks to competitors, who could then offer their own services over these networks.\nHowever, since 2011, some states have suspended these rules, citing concerns about network security and reliability. This has meant that the incumbent telephone companies have been able to retain their monopoly over local phone markets in these states, making it difficult for new competitors to enter the market.\nThe Justice Department argues that these suspensions are unjustified and go against the spirit of the Telecommunications Act. In a statement, the department said that they were \"deeply concerned about the impact of these suspensions on consumers, who are being denied the benefits of competition in the form of lower prices, more choice, and better service.\"\nThe department's petition has been welcomed by consumer advocates, who have long been campaigning for the reinstatement of the federal rules. \"This is a victory for consumers,\" said Yosef Getachew, Media and Democracy Program Director at the nonprofit Public Knowledge. \"It's time for the Supreme Court to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable local telephone services.\"\nThe petition comes at a time when the importance of local telephone services has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Millions of Americans have found themselves reliant on local phone services for communication with family, friends, and medical professionals during lockdowns and social distancing measures.\nThe Justice Department's move is also significant in the context of wider concerns about the concentration of power in the tech industry. Companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years over their ability to dominate markets and stifle competition.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to consider the petition in the coming months. If the court decides to lift the suspensions, it could open up local phone markets across the country to competition, benefiting millions of Americans.", "It has been announced that British telecommunications company, BT, has agreed to merge with its US counterpart, MCI Communications, in a landmark deal worth $22 billion.\nThe merger, which represents one of the biggest ever transatlantic deals in the telecoms industry, is set to create a powerful new entity with a combined workforce of over 200,000 employees, serving customers in more than 100 countries worldwide.\nThe deal was confirmed earlier today by BT chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, and MCI chairman, Bert C. Roberts Jr., who described the move as a \"win-win situation for both companies\".\nThe new company, which has yet to be named, will be split into two divisions, with BT retaining its traditional business of fixed line phone services and MCI managing its wireless and internet operations. It is hoped that this new structure will enable the merged company to better compete with its global rivals, including AT&T and Verizon.\nBoth companies have been looking for ways to expand their businesses and increase their global reach, and the merger is seen as a strategic move to achieve these goals. Sir Peter Bonfield commented: \"This is a logical and highly attractive merger of two great companies which have a strong strategic fit and an exciting future ahead.\"\nThe deal has been welcomed by analysts, who believe that the creation of a new global powerhouse could reshape the telecoms industry. Daniel Berner, a Senior Research Analyst at Forrester Research, said: \"The combination of BT and MCI creates a formidable player in the telecommunications industry, and will go a long way towards putting pressure on other providers to consolidate in order to remain competitive.\"\nThe merger is also set to have a significant impact on the global economy, with the new combined company expected to generate annual revenues of around $60 billion. It will also provide a boost to the UK economy, as BT is one of the country's largest employers and the merger is expected to create new jobs in the tech sector.\nHowever, the deal is not without its challenges. The telecoms industry is notoriously competitive, and the merged company will need to work hard to retain its market share and ensure that it can continue to innovate and develop new products and services.\nThere are also concerns about the impact the merger could have on consumers, particularly in terms of pricing and service quality. In recent years, both BT and MCI have faced criticism over their customer service records, and there will be pressure on the new company to address these issues and provide a better experience for its users.\nDespite these challenges, however, it is believed that the merger between BT and MCI represents a major step forward for the telecoms industry, and could pave the way for future consolidation and collaboration between companies.\nThe merger is subject to regulatory approval in both the UK and the US, and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. It is hoped that the new company will be able to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact on the global telecoms market.\nIn conclusion, the BT-MCI merger represents a significant development in the telecoms industry, and is set to create a new global powerhouse with the potential to reshape the market. While there are challenges ahead, the merger is a clear indication of the ambition and vision of both companies, and highlights the importance of collaboration and consolidation in the fast-moving world of technology and communications.", "London, UK - Cancer patients and their doctors are eagerly awaiting new data on British Biotech's anti-cancer treatment, Marimastat at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) meeting in Madrid, Spain.\nMarimastat is a type of drug called a matrix metalloproteinase enzyme inhibitor, which works by blocking an enzyme that promotes the spread of cancer cells. The drug has been in development for over a decade and has already undergone several clinical trials.\nBritish Biotech CEO, Joanna Horobin, said: \"We are excited to share our latest data at the ESMO meeting. Marimastat has the potential to be a game-changer in the field of cancer treatment, and we are committed to advancing research and development to bring this drug to patients in need.\"\nThe latest data being presented at ESMO could be a major step forward in the development of Marimastat. The drug is being tested in combination with other cancer treatments, and the new data will reveal how well it has performed in these studies.\nAnalysts have long been bullish on Marimastat, citing its promising clinical trial results and potential to address a significant unmet need in the cancer treatment landscape. But the drug has yet to receive regulatory approval, and there are some concerns about its safety profile.\nOne of the key issues with Marimastat is its potential to cause liver toxicity. Some patients in earlier clinical trials experienced elevated liver enzymes, and there is a worry that long-term use of the drug could lead to liver damage.\nHowever, British Biotech has worked to address these concerns, and the company says that the latest data shows no signs of liver toxicity. The data being presented at ESMO will provide further insight into the safety and efficacy of the drug.\nIf Marimastat is ultimately approved, it could be a game-changer in the cancer treatment market. The drug is being tested in a range of cancers, including lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and certain types of leukemia.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, there are approximately 1.8 million new cancer cases diagnosed each year in the United States alone. The global cancer treatment market is projected to reach $237.8 billion by 2026, driven by an aging population and increasing rates of cancer diagnoses.\nCancer treatment options have come a long way in recent years, with the development of new immunotherapies and targeted therapies. However, there is still a significant need for new treatments that can address the spread of cancer cells and improve overall survival rates.\nMarimastat represents a potential breakthrough in this regard, and the data being presented at ESMO could be a major catalyst for the drug's development.\nWith so much riding on the success of Marimastat, analysts are eagerly awaiting the latest data from the ESMO meeting. If the drug shows positive results in the trials, it could be a major step forward in the fight against cancer, and a major win for British Biotech.", "The world's largest cocoa producer, Ivory Coast, has recorded a significant decrease in its cocoa arrivals for the 1996/97 season. When compared to the previous year, the country's cocoa arrivals have decreased by approximately 10 percent.\nThe decrease in cocoa arrivals comes as a surprise as analysts earlier predicted that production would show a significant increase. However, the country's harvest season, which began in October, has been plagued with delays and drier than expected weather conditions.\nAccording to Reuters, the data from the country's marketing board - the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC) - showed that cocoa arrivals had reached 1.24 million tonnes by January 31. This is a significant decline from last year's figures, which stood at 1.38 million tonnes for the same period.\nCocoa prices have also been affected by the decrease in production. Prices at the New York Stock Exchange are currently trading at $2,436 per tonne - a decrease of 13 percent since the beginning of the year.\nDespite the decline in cocoa arrivals, the CCC has stated that it expects production to recover in the coming months. The marketing board attributes this to a possible change in weather conditions as well as an increase in farmgate prices.\nFarmgate prices refer to the price at which farmers sell their cocoa beans to middlemen who then sell to the marketing board. The CCC has increased the farmgate price from 750 CFA francs ($1.28) per kilogram to 825 CFA francs ($1.41) per kilogram in a bid to encourage farmers to sell their beans to the board.\nIt is also anticipated that the country's cocoa arrivals will get a boost in February and March when the bulk of the season's crop is expected to arrive. The CCC's managing director, Yves Brahima Kone, confirmed this in a recent statement where he acknowledged the current lull in production but emphasized that \"the volumes of cocoa to be exported over the rest of the season should be very satisfactory.\"\nAn increase in production would be welcomed news for the Ivorian government, which is heavily reliant on cocoa exports for foreign currency earnings. In 2019, cocoa accounted for 40 percent of the country's export earnings, with the government aiming to boost cocoa exports to two million tonnes by 2020.\nThe Ivorian government has implemented several measures to improve the yield and quality of cocoa, including the establishment of a cocoa regulator, the Cocoa and Coffee Council, which controls and oversees the country's cocoa sector.\nThere have also been efforts to improve the lives of cocoa farmers, who form the backbone of the industry. In 2018, the government set up the National Agricultural Insurance Fund, which provides insurance coverage for farmers in the case of adverse weather conditions or other emergencies such as pest outbreaks.\nWhile the country's cocoa exports have suffered a setback this season, there is optimism that production will pick up in the coming months. However, with the unpredictability of weather patterns and ongoing issues with cocoa smuggling across the borders with Ghana and Burkina Faso, the country must continue to implement measures that will protect and support its vital cocoa sector.", "British Energy, one of the largest utility companies in the UK, has announced that it will be cutting jobs in response to criticisms from both the stock market and unions. The company has been under increasing pressure to improve its financial performance and to make cuts to maintain profitability.\nThe job cuts are expected to affect around 1,500 employees, or roughly 10% of the workforce. The reductions will be spread across the company's operations, with the largest number of cuts expected in the company's administrative and support functions.\nIn a statement to the press, British Energy CEO John Smith acknowledged the challenges facing the company and the difficult decision to cut jobs. \"We understand that this will be a difficult time for our employees, and we are committed to supporting them through the process,\" he said. \"However, we believe that these cuts are necessary to position the company for future success.\"\nThe announcement was met with criticism from both the stock market and the unions. The company's shares fell sharply on the news, with investors concerned about the impact of the cuts on the company's operational capacity. The unions, meanwhile, condemned the move as a short-sighted and potentially damaging decision.\n\"British Energy's decision to cut jobs is a betrayal of its workforce and of its commitment to the communities it serves,\" said Unite the Union's National Officer for Energy, Matt Lay. \"The company is putting profit before people, and it risks seriously undermining its operational capability and its reputation in the process.\"\nLay also criticized the government's lack of intervention in the matter, saying that ministers needed to take action to protect jobs and to ensure that companies like British Energy were held accountable for their actions. \"This government has a duty to protect workers and to ensure that companies like British Energy are acting in the public interest,\" he said. \"We need to see real action to support workers and to ensure that this kind of short-term thinking doesn't become a trend across the energy sector.\"\nThe announcement from British Energy comes at a difficult time for the UK energy sector, which has been struggling to navigate a changing landscape of regulation and technological disruption. The sector is facing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, to adopt renewable energy technologies, and to transition away from fossil fuels. At the same time, the sector is also under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiency in the face of reduced profit margins and increasing competition.\nThe job cuts at British Energy are just the latest in a series of austerity measures across the energy sector, and many experts predict that further cuts may be on the horizon. The industry is also facing pressure from Brexit, which has created uncertainty around the future of energy trading relationships and supply chains.\nDespite these challenges, some analysts remain bullish about the prospects for the energy sector in the UK. According to a recent report by the international energy research firm, Wood Mackenzie, the UK has the potential to become a leader in offshore wind energy, with the potential to generate up to 85 GW of electricity by 2050. This growth could create many new jobs in the sector, and could help to offset some of the losses from the current round of consolidation and austerity.\nThe coming months will be crucial for British Energy and for the wider energy sector in the UK. Companies will need to navigate the changing landscape of regulation and technology, while also responding to new political and economic developments. The success of these efforts will depend on a variety of factors, including the ability to innovate, to manage costs, and to deliver on commitments to customers and to communities. As the sector evolves, it will be increasingly important for companies to be proactive and to anticipate and respond to challenges in a timely and effective manner.", "In a recent press conference, a prominent lawyer for the tobacco industry accused state governments of unfairly demonizing his clients with anti-racketeering lawsuits. According to the lawyer, these lawsuits are not only frivolous but also represent a clear violation of the constitutional rights of tobacco companies.\nThe lawyer argued that the tobacco industry is a legitimate business that operates within the framework of the law. He stated that his clients have followed all applicable regulations and have never engaged in any illegal or unethical activity. Despite this, he claimed, state governments have repeatedly sought to paint the tobacco industry as a criminal enterprise.\nThese efforts have taken the form of anti-racketeering lawsuits, a tactic that the lawyer described as both unjust and misguided. He explained that these lawsuits rely on a broad and vague definition of racketeering that allows the government to target any legitimate business that it believes may have engaged in any form of wrongdoing.\nIn the case of the tobacco industry, he argued, this definition has been stretched beyond all reason. The lawyer claimed that many of the alleged offenses cited in anti-racketeering lawsuits against the tobacco industry are minor or unsubstantiated. He pointed out that the majority of smokers are consenting adults who are fully aware of the risks associated with tobacco use and that the industry has always been transparent about the dangers of its products.\nDespite this, he said, state governments have persistently attempted to portray the tobacco industry as a sinister force that preys on vulnerable individuals. The lawyer suggested that this portrayal was motivated by political and ideological biases rather than any genuine concern for public health or safety.\nHe pointed out that tobacco companies have had to pay billions of dollars in damages as a result of these lawsuits, even though they have not been found guilty of any criminal activity. This, he argued, is an egregious violation of the constitutional rights of his clients.\nThe lawyer suggested that the government's focus should be on enforcing existing regulations rather than pursuing frivolous lawsuits. He pointed out that the tobacco industry is already subject to extensive federal oversight and that there are a multitude of laws and regulations in place to ensure that tobacco products are safe and clearly labeled.\nFurthermore, he argued, the government should take a more nuanced and evidence-based approach to tackling the issue of smoking. He suggested that policies aimed at reducing tobacco use should be based on sound scientific evidence and take into account the complex social and economic factors that contribute to smoking.\nThe lawyer's comments have been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised him for championing the constitutional rights of his clients and standing up to what they see as government overreach. Others, however, have criticized him for downplaying the harms associated with tobacco use and ignoring the role that the tobacco industry has played in fueling the current public health crisis.\nMany public health advocates argue that the tobacco industry has a long history of engaging in unethical and deceptive practices, including marketing to children and minorities and downplaying the dangers of their products. They point out that smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States alone and is a leading cause of preventable disease and disability.\nDespite these concerns, the tobacco industry remains a powerful and influential force in the world of politics and public policy. The lawyer's comments serve as a reminder of the ongoing debate over how best to tackle the complex and multifaceted issue of smoking and underscore the need for a more nuanced and evidence-based approach.", "The telecommunications industry is no stranger to regulatory changes. However, the recent trend towards deregulation has thrown up an interesting challenge for the local telephone market. With the removal of government controls, companies have had to find new ways to compete in a sector that was once highly restricted.\nIn the past, the telecommunications industry was tightly regulated by the government. This ensured that all telephone services were of a certain standard and price. However, this also meant that there was very little room for competition. Companies could not offer more varied services or better pricing.\nBut changes in technology and the opening up of the industry have led to a new era of deregulation. Governments around the world have been loosening their grip on the telecommunications market, in the belief that competition will drive innovation and improve services for consumers.\nThe United States is one country that has been at the forefront of this deregulation trend. Starting in the 1980s, the government began to dismantle the monopoly of AT&T, the company that dominated the telephone market at the time. Over the years, new competitors emerged and the industry became more diverse.\nHowever, this transformation was not always smooth or simple. As competitors entered the market, they found it difficult to compete with the established players. The infrastructure required to provide telephone services was complex and expensive, and many companies simply could not afford to build their own networks. This meant that the market remained dominated by a few large companies.\nToday, the local telephone market in the United States is still not as competitive as regulators would like. However, the industry has found a new way to foster competition: through the internet.\nAs the internet has grown in popularity, more and more people are choosing to use online phone services. These services use the internet to transmit calls, rather than traditional phone lines. They are often cheaper and more flexible than traditional telephone services.\nThis has put pressure on traditional phone companies to offer better services and pricing. Customers are now more likely to switch providers, as the cost and hassle of doing so is lower. This has forced the industry to become more customer-focused and innovative.\nOne company that has taken advantage of this new trend is Vonage. Founded in 2001, Vonage was one of the first companies to offer internet-based phone services. Since then, it has grown rapidly and now has over 2.5 million customers in the United States.\nVonage\u2019s success has been partly due to the flexibility of its services. Customers can use Vonage over any reliable broadband internet connection, whether that\u2019s at home or on the go. They can also choose from a range of plans and features, depending on their needs.\nHowever, it\u2019s not just the flexibility of its services that sets Vonage apart. The company has also made a concerted effort to build a strong relationship with its customers. Vonage offers round-the-clock customer service, with representatives available to help customers with any issues they may have. This has helped the company to build a loyal customer base, even in an industry that has traditionally been driven by price.\nOther companies have followed Vonage\u2019s lead, with internet-based phone services becoming increasingly popular. Skype, which was initially designed for video calls, has also become a popular option for making voice calls over the internet. And Google has launched Google Voice, a service that allows users to make calls and send texts through a central phone number.\nThe success of these internet-based phone services has shown that there are still opportunities for new entrants to compete in the telecommunications industry. Rather than trying to build their own infrastructure, companies can leverage the existing internet infrastructure to provide innovative and flexible services.\nOf course, internet-based phone services have their own challenges. The quality of calls can be affected by internet speeds, and some customers may have concerns about the security and privacy of their calls. However, as the technology continues to improve, these issues are likely to become less of a concern.\nThe deregulation of the local telephone market has opened up new opportunities for companies to compete. By leveraging the internet, companies can provide innovative and flexible services that challenge the established players. As the industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how companies adapt and compete in this new landscape.", "Privacy advocates and phone companies are at odds over a new telecom law that allows companies to sell customer data to third-party entities, such as marketers. The law, which was signed by the president last month, has raised concerns about the privacy of consumers and the potential misuse of their information.\nThe telecom law, officially called the Restoring Internet Freedom Order, repeals regulations that were put in place under the Obama administration to protect net neutrality. The order also includes provisions that allow phone companies to sell customer data to third-party entities without their consent.\nThis has sparked outrage among privacy advocates, who argue that the law puts consumers at risk of having their personal information sold and exploited for profit. They believe that phone companies should not be able to profit off of their customers' private data without their permission.\n\"Phone companies should not be able to profit off of our personal information without our consent,\" said John Doe, a privacy advocate from New York. \"The new telecom law is a huge blow to privacy rights, and it puts consumers at risk of having their personal information sold to the highest bidder.\"\nBut phone companies argue that the new law will allow them to better serve their customers by providing targeted advertising and other personalized services. They also argue that consumers have the option to opt out of having their data sold to third-party entities.\n\"The new telecom law will allow us to provide better services and targeted advertising to our customers, which is something that they have been asking for,\" said Jane Smith, a representative from a major phone company. \"Consumers have the choice to opt out of having their data sold if they don't want to participate in these services.\"\nHowever, privacy advocates argue that the opt-out option is not enough to protect consumers' privacy rights. They believe that consumers should have the right to opt-in to any data sharing or marketing services, rather than having to actively opt-out.\n\"The opt-out option is not a real choice for consumers,\" said Doe. \"People shouldn't have to go out of their way to protect their privacy, they should be able to choose whether or not their data is used for marketing purposes in the first place.\"\nThe new telecom law has also raised questions about the potential misuse of customer data by third-party entities. Critics argue that there is no guarantee that these entities will handle consumer data responsibly or ethically.\n\"There is no way to guarantee that third-party entities will be responsible with consumers' data,\" said Mary Johnson, a consumer advocate from California. \"The telecom companies should be held accountable for the use and misuse of their customers' information, especially if they are profiting from it.\"\nDespite these concerns, the new telecom law remains in place, and phone companies are beginning to explore new marketing opportunities as a result. For example, some companies are starting to offer \"personalized\" services based on customers' browsing history and other data.\n\"Personalized services are the wave of the future, and we are excited to explore these new opportunities,\" said Smith. \"We believe that customers will appreciate the increased convenience and tailored advertisements that these services will provide.\"\nPrivacy advocates, however, remain skeptical of these claims, and are continuing to push for stronger privacy protections for consumers.\n\"The new telecom law is a huge setback for privacy rights, and we need to do everything we can to fight back against these changes,\" said Johnson. \"We must continue to advocate for strong consumer protections and privacy laws, and hold phone companies accountable for any misuse of consumer data.\"", "Moscow, Russia \u2013 Despite an upcoming surgery for former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, traders in the country's oil and gas sectors are confident that the nation's exports won't be affected.\nYeltsin, who served as Russia's first president after the fall of the Soviet Union, is set to undergo a medical procedure that could require a lengthy recovery period. Some industry experts have expressed concern that this could throw the country's oil and gas exports into disarray \u2013 a worrying prospect considering these exports bring in billions of dollars in revenue annually.\nHowever, traders in Russia's energy sector say they're not worried about any immediate impact on the nation's exports. According to Dmitry Ovchinnikov, managing director of Russia's Energy Intelligence Group, the country's oil and gas supply chain is highly diversified and not solely reliant on one individual or company.\n\"It's important to remember that Russia's oil and gas industry is made up of many different players,\" Ovchinnikov said. \"Individuals come and go, but the industry as a whole keeps moving forward. While Boris Yeltsin played a key role in shaping the industry in the 1990s, his absence won't cripple the sector today.\"\nOvchinnikov's sentiments were echoed by other market analysts, who noted that Russia has weathered oil price fluctuations, economic sanctions, and political turmoil in recent years, demonstrating its resilience as a major energy exporter.\nMoreover, Russia's energy companies have made significant investments in recent years to bolster their infrastructure and modernize their operations. This has enabled them to maintain a competitive edge in global markets and adapt to changing conditions.\nFor instance, Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, recently completed a massive $23 billion investment in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in the Arctic region. The project, which involves extracting gas from the Yamal Peninsula and transporting it to markets in Asia and Europe, is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue in the coming years.\nSimilarly, Gazprom, the country's state-controlled gas giant, has expanded its pipeline network to reach new markets and signed long-term supply contracts with countries such as China. These efforts have helped insulate Russia from the effects of geopolitical tensions and reduced demand in traditional markets.\nOf course, some uncertainties remain. In addition to Yeltsin's impending surgery, global oil and gas prices are subject to fluctuation based on numerous factors, including geopolitical tensions, weather patterns, and changes in consumer demand.\nNonetheless, traders in Russia's energy sector say they are confident that the country's oil and gas exports will remain stable in the near term. They also note that Russia has a long history of successfully navigating challenging economic and political circumstances and finding new opportunities for growth.\n\"As energy traders, we're always aware of the need to be nimble and adaptable,\" Ovchinnikov said. \"But we're also confident that Russia's energy industry has the resilience and expertise to weather whatever challenges may come our way.\"", "In a defiant move, Greycoat, the UK-based property development company, has rejected a merger attempt from Moorfield Estates, a competing firm. The decision to reject the merger comes as several rebel shareholders urged Greycoat's board members to accept the offer.\nMoorfield Estates, which is also based in the UK, had offered to merge with Greycoat in a deal worth \u00a3500 million. The proposed merger was aimed at creating a dominant player in the UK's property development market and was expected to deliver substantial benefits for both companies.\nHowever, Greycoat's board members have been steadfast in their opposition to the merger. In a statement, they said that the offer from Moorfield Estates undervalued Greycoat's assets and did not offer significant benefits for the company's shareholders.\n\"The board believes that the proposed merger with Moorfield Estates is not in the best interests of our shareholders,\" said Liam Robertson, Greycoat's chairman, in the statement. \"We have considered the offer carefully and have concluded that it undervalues our assets and does not deliver the benefits that we believe are possible from operating as an independent company.\"\nRobertson's comments came as a blow to several rebel shareholders who had been pressuring Greycoat's board members to accept the merger offer. The shareholders had argued that the deal would enable both companies to cut costs, increase efficiencies and enhance their competitiveness in the UK's property development market.\nHowever, Greycoat's management has remained unmoved by these arguments, saying that the company's current strategy is the best way to deliver long-term value to its shareholders.\n\"Our focus remains on delivering value to our shareholders through our existing strategy of developing high-quality properties in prime locations,\" said Robertson. \"We are confident that this is the best way to create long-term value for our shareholders and to maintain our position at the forefront of the UK's property development market.\"\nGreycoat's snub of Moorfield Estates comes at a time of heightened competition in the UK's property development market. With demand for new housing continuing to outstrip supply, property developers are increasingly seeking to consolidate their position through mergers and acquisitions.\nHowever, many in the industry believe that Greycoat has made the right decision in rejecting the merger with Moorfield Estates. They argue that Greycoat is well-positioned to capitalise on the growing demand for high-quality properties in the UK, and that the company is better off operating independently rather than merging with a competitor.\n\"The property development market in the UK is highly competitive, but Greycoat has a strong track record of delivering high-quality properties in prime locations,\" said Nigel Griffin, a property analyst at Panmure Gordon. \"The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for new housing in the UK, and I believe that it is better off pursuing its independent strategy rather than merging with a competitor.\"\nDespite the opposition from rebel shareholders, Greycoat's management remains confident in its strategy and is optimistic about the company's future prospects.\n\"We believe that our focus on developing high-quality properties in prime locations will enable us to maintain our position at the forefront of the UK's property development market,\" said Robertson. \"We remain committed to delivering long-term value to our shareholders and to continuing our growth trajectory in the years to come.\"", "Colombia has vehemently denied that its army is linked to paramilitary death squads operating within the country. The government has instead pointed fingers at leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers, accusing them of spreading lies and misinformation.\nIn a statement released on Wednesday, Colombian authorities claimed that accusations linking the army to these groups were baseless and unfounded.\n\"The Colombian army operates in full compliance with international human rights law,\" read the statement. \"We categorically deny any involvement or complicity in the activities of illegal armed groups operating in our country.\"\nThe accusations against the army first surfaced last week, when an investigation by the New York Times uncovered evidence suggesting that soldiers were collaborating with paramilitary groups in the killing of civilians, including activists and social leaders.\nAccording to the report, members of the army were working alongside the paramilitary groups to target individuals deemed to be a threat to government interests, such as those advocating for human rights or environmental protection.\nThe allegations sparked outrage from human rights organizations and opposition politicians, who called for an immediate investigation into the matter.\nBut the Colombian government has dismissed the claims as part of a broader conspiracy to undermine the country's security forces.\n\"Leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers have long sought to discredit the Colombian army and tar its reputation,\" said one government official. \"These allegations are part of their ongoing campaign to undermine our democracy and wreak havoc on our society.\"\nThe government's response has drawn criticism from many quarters, with some activists accusing officials of being complicit in the violence that has plagued the country for decades.\n\"We need to hold the government accountable for its role in perpetuating the violence that has ravaged our communities,\" said one advocate. \"The fact that they continue to deny any responsibility is a slap in the face to the countless victims of this conflict.\"\nDespite the denials from the government, pressure is mounting for a more thorough investigation into the alleged links between the army and paramilitary groups. Whether or not this will bring justice to the victims of this violence remains to be seen.", "Ivorian exporters are up in arms over the government's plan to hold them liable for income taxes owed by their upcountry buyers. The plan, which was announced by the Ivorian Revenue Service (IRS), has been met with fierce opposition from a united front of exporters.\nThe new policy requires exporters to obtain proof of tax payments from upcountry buyers before exporting goods. If the buyers fail to provide proof of payment, the exporter will be held liable for the unpaid tax.\nAccording to the IRS, the new policy aims to improve tax compliance and reduce the amount of tax evasion by upcountry buyers.\nHowever, exporters argue that the policy is unfair and will hurt the industry. They argue that they have no control over the tax compliance of upcountry buyers and should not be held responsible for their actions.\n\"Exporters are not tax collectors,\" said John Koffi, CEO of the Ivorian Cocoa Exporters Association. \"Our job is to export goods, not to ensure tax compliance of upcountry buyers. It's not fair to hold us responsible for their actions.\"\nThe Ivorian government has been trying to improve tax collection in recent years, especially in the cocoa sector. Cocoa is one of the country's main exports and a major source of revenue. However, tax evasion is a widespread problem in the sector, especially among upcountry buyers who purchase cocoa from smallholder farmers.\nThe government's effort to improve tax compliance has been gaining traction in recent years, but the new policy has been met with resistance from exporters who fear it will hurt their business.\n\"Exporters are already struggling with a lot of challenges, including high transportation costs, delays at the ports, and low prices for their goods,\" said Koffi. \"Adding this new burden on them is unfair and will make it even more difficult for them to do business.\"\nExporters are now calling on the government to reconsider the new policy and come up with a more equitable solution to the tax problem.\n\"We understand the government's need to improve tax compliance, but this policy is not the answer,\" said Koffi. \"We need to work together to find a solution that is fair for everyone involved.\"\nThe Ivorian government has yet to respond to the exporters' demands. However, the issue is expected to be discussed further in the coming weeks as the government and exporters look for a way forward.\nIn the meantime, Ivorian exporters are hoping that the government will listen to their concerns and come up with a solution that is fair and equitable for all parties involved. They argue that their industry is crucial for the country's economy and should not be burdened with undue taxes and responsibilities.\n\"We want to work with the government to improve tax compliance, but not at the expense of our industry,\" said Koffi. \"We hope that a solution can be found that benefits everyone involved.\"", "Rupert Murdoch Grooms Next Generation to Take Over His Media Empire\nRupert Murdoch, the media tycoon and founder of News Corp, is preparing to hand over control to his two sons, James and Lachlan. The move comes as part of a long-term plan to secure the future of the Murdoch media empire, which includes The Sun, The Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Fox News.\nSpeculation about a possible media dynasty has been rife for years, with James having stepped down from his position as CEO of 21st Century Fox in 2019, while Lachlan has taken on a more active role in the family business. The succession has been in the works for some time.\nMurdoch, now 89 years old, has spent the last few years grooming his sons for the top job. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this year, he described the succession as \"a well-prepared plan that has been in place for a long time.\"\nThe handover comes at a crucial time for the Murdoch family, with the media industry undergoing significant changes. Traditional print newspaper circulation has been in decline for years, while digital media is becoming increasingly important. Meanwhile, the regulation of media companies such as News Corp is under greater scrutiny than ever.\nDespite these challenges, the Murdoch family is confident that it can navigate these changes successfully. James, in particular, has been seen as a key figure who can oversee the development of digital media. He has led investments in streaming services and digital media, including the acquisition of video advertising platform Unruly.\nLachlan, meanwhile, has been involved in News Corp's US newspapers and has been seen as a key figure in the family's media business. He also played a crucial role in the merger of 21st Century Fox with Disney, which saw the family business take a significant stake in the entertainment giant.\nThe Murdoch family is known for its often controversial stance on political and social issues, particularly in the UK and US. The family's support for Brexit and the Trump presidency has attracted widespread criticism, while their coverage of events such as the phone hacking scandal at the News of the World has led to calls for greater regulation of the media.\nDespite these controversies, the Murdoch family has remained a significant force in the media industry. It is unlikely that the handover will lead to any significant change in the family's political or commercial views. However, the family is aware that it needs to adapt to changing media trends and regulations if it is to remain successful.\nIn recent years, the family has been working to diversify its media portfolio, investing in digital media and streaming services. James, in particular, has been at the forefront of these efforts. His successful acquisition of Unruly, a video advertising platform, has given News Corp a foothold in the digital advertising space.\nThe Murdoch family is also aware that it cannot rely solely on advertising revenue in the digital age. Subscription models, such as those used by the New York Times and The Guardian, are becoming increasingly important. News Corp has already introduced a subscription model for The Times, which has been successful in generating revenue.\nThe handover of control to James and Lachlan is likely to be a gradual process. Rupert Murdoch is not expected to step down anytime soon, and is likely to remain actively involved in the family business for some time. This will give his sons the opportunity to learn and gain experience in their respective roles.\nThe Murdoch family has faced a number of challenges over the years, including the phone hacking scandal and the fallout from the Fox News sexual harassment scandal. However, the family has always managed to navigate these challenges successfully. It is confident that it can do so again as it prepares for the next phase of its media business.\nThe media industry is undergoing significant changes. The rise of digital media has transformed the way we consume news and entertainment. The Murdoch family is aware of these changes and is actively working to adapt to them. The succession plan is part of this ongoing process, ensuring that the family business remains successful for many years to come.", "In the wake of Deng Xiaoping's death, one man is making all the right moves to cement his power in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \u2013 Jiang Zemin.\nAccording to analysts, Jiang's actions in the years since Deng's passing have been calculated and strategic, with the goal of consolidating his own power and steering the country in a direction that aligns with his political views.\nOne of the keys to Jiang's success, according to experts, has been his ability to forge alliances with other powerful figures within the CCP. By cultivating relationships with influential figures like Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, Jiang has been able to build a formidable base of support within the party's upper ranks.\nJiang has also been careful to cultivate relationships with key players in the military, positioning himself as a strong advocate for China's armed forces and championing efforts to modernize and strengthen the country's military capabilities.\nOne of the most significant steps Jiang has taken to cement his power has been his ruthless crackdown on the spiritual movement Falun Gong. Since the group was banned in 1999, Jiang has overseen a brutal campaign of arrests, detentions, and forced labor aimed at eradicating the group and its ideology from Chinese society.\nWhile the crackdown has drawn international condemnation, it has also served to bolster Jiang's political standing within the party, with many CCP officials viewing his hardline stance on the group as a show of strength and decisive leadership.\nAnother key to Jiang's success has been his ability to leverage China's economic growth to his advantage. Under his leadership, the country has embarked on a series of ambitious economic reforms, including a shift towards a market-oriented economy and a focus on infrastructure development.\nThese efforts have helped China emerge as a major global economic power, and Jiang has used this newfound clout to boost his own standing within the CCP. By positioning himself as a visionary leader capable of steering China towards even greater economic success, Jiang has been able to win support from within the party and consolidate his own power.\nDespite his many successes, however, Jiang is not without his detractors. Some within the CCP have accused him of being too authoritarian and prone to stifling dissent, while others have criticized his handling of sensitive diplomatic issues like Taiwan and Tibet.\nStill, most analysts agree that Jiang's impressive political maneuvering and savvy leadership have made him one of the most influential figures within China's ruling party, and a key player in shaping the direction of the country in the post-Deng era.\nAs the country continues to grapple with complex issues like economic growth, political reform, and international relations, Jiang's influence is likely to remain a vital force within the CCP for years to come. And with many analysts praising his skill and political acumen, it seems likely that he will continue to make all the right moves to retain his power and shape China's future in ways that align with his own vision and worldview.", "Wired Magazine, the popular technology and science publication, recently launched its initial public offering (IPO) in hopes of raising capital to fund future growth. However, some investors are questioning whether the company's future prospects are worth the price tag.\nThe IPO, which hit the market in early November, offered shares at a price of $15 each, with a total of 5 million shares available to the public. The company is expected to raise around $75 million in capital through the offering.\nWired Magazine has experienced impressive growth over the past few years, with its digital and print subscriptions both on the rise. The publication has expanded its audience through its engaging content and relatable approach to technology and science news.\nHowever, some experts are questioning the sustainability of the publication's growth. Wired Magazine operates in a highly competitive market, with numerous other technology and science publications vying for readership. The publication also faces stiff competition from social media, which allows users to access news and information more quickly and conveniently than traditional media outlets.\nAdditionally, some investors are concerned about the overall health of the media industry. Many traditional news outlets are struggling with declining ad revenue and shifting consumer preferences, and there is concern that Wired Magazine could face similar challenges in the future.\nDespite these concerns, Wired Magazine is optimistic about its future prospects. In a recent statement, the company noted that its strong digital presence and growing audience base put it in a strong position for future growth.\nFurthermore, the publication has made a number of strategic moves in recent years to bolster its offerings and stay ahead of the competition. For example, Wired Magazine has launched several new verticals focused on specific topics, such as transportation and entertainment, to help attract niche audiences.\nWired Magazine has also invested in immersive and interactive storytelling formats, such as its popular AR and VR experiences, to engage readers in new and exciting ways. These types of innovations have helped the publication stay relevant and engaging in an era of constant technological change.\nDespite these efforts, it remains to be seen whether investors will be willing to bet on Wired Magazine's future success. The media industry is notoriously fickle, with consumer preferences and technological advancements shifting rapidly. Many media companies that were once seen as strong investments have faltered in recent years, as the industry has struggled to adapt to changing times.\nWired Magazine will need to continue innovating and staying ahead of the curve if it hopes to remain competitive in the years ahead. The publication's loyal readership and engaging content are certainly a good start, but investors will be looking for concrete evidence that the company can continue to grow and succeed over the long term.\nFor now, many investors are taking a wait-and-see approach to the Wired Magazine IPO. While the company has certainly made strides in recent years, there are still questions and concerns about its future prospects. Ultimately, it will be up to consumers and investors to determine whether Wired Magazine is a better read than investment.", "Hong Kong - Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe has fled to Hong Kong and is seeking asylum in the United States, citing persecution by the Chinese government. Wang is known for his social activism, especially his work in advocating for the rights of migrant workers in China.\nWang is a former professor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. He was suspended from his position in 2018 after he criticized the university's handling of sexual harassment complaints. After his suspension, Wang continued to fight for the rights of workers and was an active member of various labor organizations.\nHowever, Wang's activism eventually caught the attention of the Chinese authorities, leading to his detention for several weeks in 2019. During his detention, Wang was reportedly subjected to physical and psychological torture, including sleep deprivation and beatings.\nAfter his release, Wang continued his activism but faced increasing pressure from the Chinese government. In January 2021, he was detained again and charged with \"inciting subversion of state power.\" He was released on bail but was placed under surveillance and had his movement restricted.\nWang's situation came to international attention after he posted a video on social media in which he accused the Chinese government of mistreating him and other dissidents. In the video, he also announced his decision to flee to Hong Kong.\n\"I've decided to come to Hong Kong because I can no longer stay in China. My life and safety are in danger,\" Wang said in the video. \"I am seeking asylum in the United States because I believe that it is the only country that can offer me the protection I need.\"\nWang arrived in Hong Kong on Thursday, and since then, he has been staying in a safe house under the protection of a local activist group. He has also been in contact with US officials, who are reportedly considering his asylum request.\nWang's case highlights the increasingly precarious situation for dissidents and activists in China. The Chinese government has cracked down on free speech and dissent in recent years, with many activists and journalists being arrested, detained, or silenced.\nHuman rights advocates have called on the international community to do more to protect the rights of Chinese dissidents and to pressure the Chinese government to respect human rights. They have also criticized the Hong Kong government for its role in cracking down on protests and dissent in the city.\n\"The Chinese government is using all means to silence dissent, and Hong Kong is no longer a safe haven for dissidents,\" said a spokesperson for Human Rights Watch. \"The international community must take action to protect the rights of Chinese activists and to hold the Chinese government accountable for its actions.\"\nWang's case also raises questions about the US government's approach to asylum seekers. The Trump administration had severely limited the number of refugees and asylum seekers it would accept, leading to criticism from human rights groups. The Biden administration has promised to reverse some of the Trump-era policies and to increase the number of refugees and asylum seekers admitted to the US.\nFor now, Wang remains in Hong Kong, waiting for news about his asylum application. He has said that he hopes his case will draw attention to the plight of other dissidents in China and encourage the international community to take action.\n\"I am not the only one who is suffering. There are many others like me who are fighting for freedom and justice in China,\" Wang said. \"I hope my case will shed light on the injustices in China and push the world to do more to support the rights of Chinese people.\"", "Prague, Czech Republic - The President of Komercn\u00ed Banka, the second-largest bank in the country, has announced his candidacy for the Senate in the upcoming elections. Jan Juchelka, who has been at the helm of the bank since 2018, has been campaigning on a platform of regulatory reform in the Czech banking sector.\nJuchelka's candidacy comes at a time when the country's banking sector is facing severe scrutiny. The Czech National Bank, the country's central bank, has accused a number of banks of engaging in illegal activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. The accusations have put the spotlight on the country's financial institutions, with many calling for greater transparency and a more robust regulatory framework.\nIn an interview with the local media, Juchelka said that he was running for the Senate because he believed that the banking sector needed to be cleaned up. He argued that the current regulatory framework was ineffective and that there was a need for greater oversight of the industry.\n\"Banking is a vital part of our economy, and it is important that people have confidence in the financial institutions that they entrust with their money,\" Juchelka said. \"The current regulatory framework has failed to prevent the kind of illegal activities that we have seen in recent years. We need to take a fresh approach to regulation, one that is focused on ensuring that the interests of customers and taxpayers are protected.\"\nJuchelka's candidacy has been welcomed by many in the banking industry. Tomas Svoboda, the CEO of the Czech Banking Association, said that Juchelka's experience in the sector made him a strong candidate.\n\"Jan Juchelka has been a leading figure in the banking sector for many years, and he has a deep understanding of how the industry works,\" Svoboda said. \"His candidacy is a positive development for the sector, and we believe that he will bring a much-needed perspective to the Senate on issues that are important to our industry.\"\nJuchelka's campaign has also been supported by a number of consumer groups, who have been calling for greater transparency in the banking sector. Pavel Trantina, the head of the Czech Association of Consumer Organizations, said that Juchelka's candidacy was a positive step forward for consumers.\n\"The banking sector has been plagued by scandals in recent years, and it is important that we have someone in government who is willing to push for greater transparency and accountability,\" Trantina said. \"Jan Juchelka has the knowledge and experience to do this, and we believe that his candidacy is a positive development for consumers.\"\nJuchelka's campaign has not been without controversy, however. Some critics have accused him of being too close to the banking industry and of not being willing to take on the major players in the sector.\nIn response to these accusations, Juchelka said that he was committed to putting the interests of consumers first. He said that he recognised that some consumers had been let down by the banking sector in recent years, and that he was committed to addressing their concerns.\n\"I understand that there is a certain amount of mistrust towards the banking sector, and that some people feel that their interests have not been taken into account,\" Juchelka said. \"I am committed to changing that, and to ensuring that the interests of consumers are at the heart of everything we do.\"\nJuchelka's candidacy comes at a time when the Czech Republic is facing a number of economic challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the country hard, causing significant damage to many businesses and industries. In addition to this, the country is facing a number of long-term economic challenges, such as an ageing population, a skills gap in the workforce and a lack of investment in key areas such as infrastructure.\nSpeaking about these challenges, Juchelka said that he was committed to ensuring that the banking sector played its part in supporting the country's economic recovery.\n\"The banking sector has an important role to play in supporting the country's economy, and I am committed to ensuring that we do everything we can to help businesses and individuals to recover from the pandemic,\" Juchelka said. \"We need to focus on creating a supportive environment for businesses, and on investing in areas such as infrastructure, skills development and innovation. I believe that the banking sector can play a critical role in these efforts, and I am committed to ensuring that we do our part.\"\nJuchelka's candidacy has attracted significant attention from the media and from the public. Many are watching closely to see how he will fare in the upcoming elections, and whether he will be successful in his bid to tackle the challenges facing the banking sector and the wider economy.\nRegardless of the outcome, Juchelka's candidacy has opened up an important debate about the future of the Czech banking sector. Whether through his own efforts or through the efforts of others, it is clear that there is a need for significant change in this area. The stakes are high, and the outcome of this debate will have a significant impact on the country's future economic prospects.", "Sun Microsystems Inc., a technology company specializing in hardware and software products, reported strong earnings and announced several milestones this week. However, the company\u2019s stock experienced a significant drop, surprising investors and analysts.\nSun Microsystems Inc. reported earnings of $3.1 billion for the third quarter, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenue from the company\u2019s software business and its cloud computing division also saw strong growth. In addition, Sun Microsystems Inc. announced several milestones, including the launch of a new software application and the completion of a major infrastructure project.\nDespite these positive developments, Sun Microsystems Inc.\u2019s stock plummeted by nearly 20% in after-hours trading. The reason behind this sudden drop remains unclear, as company officials have yet to release a statement. Investors and analysts have been left scratching their heads, trying to make sense of this unexpected turn of events.\nSome analysts speculate that the stock decline is related to broader market trends, which have been volatile in recent months. Others suggest that investors may be reacting to news of a major acquisition by Sun Microsystems Inc. One thing is clear, however: the strong earnings report and product milestones were not enough to keep the company\u2019s stock from plummeting.\nIndustry experts are divided on the long-term implications of this stock drop for Sun Microsystems Inc. Some believe that it is merely a temporary setback, and that the company will recover in due time. They point to the company\u2019s solid financials, strong product portfolio, and skilled workforce as reasons for optimism.\nOthers, however, are more pessimistic about the company\u2019s future prospects. They argue that the stock decline is a sign that Sun Microsystems Inc. is struggling to keep pace with its competitors in an increasingly crowded market. They point to the company\u2019s stagnant revenue growth and declining market share as evidence that Sun Microsystems Inc. may be losing ground to rivals such as IBM and Hewlett Packard.\nTo be sure, Sun Microsystems Inc. faces several challenges in the years ahead. The technology industry is constantly evolving, and companies must remain agile and innovative in order to stay ahead of the curve. Sun Microsystems Inc. will need to continue investing in new products and technologies if it hopes to remain relevant in this fast-paced environment.\nAt the same time, Sun Microsystems Inc. also has several advantages that could help it weather these challenges. The company has a strong brand and loyal customer base, which could provide a stable foundation for growth. In addition, Sun Microsystems Inc. has a proven track record of innovation, with a long history of developing groundbreaking technologies such as Java and Solaris.\nAs the company moves forward, it will need to strike a delicate balance between maintaining this innovative spirit and meeting the evolving needs of its customers. This will require a deep understanding of emerging technologies, as well as a commitment to staying true to the company\u2019s long-standing values and principles.\nUltimately, the future of Sun Microsystems Inc. remains uncertain. The company\u2019s recent earnings report and milestones may have been impressive, but they were not enough to prevent a significant drop in its stock price. As Sun Microsystems Inc. enters a new era, it will need to navigate a complex and ever-changing landscape, while staying true to its vision and values. Only time will tell whether it is up to the task.", "Detroit, MI - Ford Motor Company announced on Tuesday that it had experienced a significant rise in profits in the second quarter of 2021, thanks to high sales of pickup trucks and SUVs in the United States.\nThe automaker revealed that its revenue in the quarter had increased 38% from a year earlier, to $26.8 billion. Meanwhile, net income went up to $561 million, from $148 million in the same period last year.\nAccording to executives from Ford, the success was due to robust demand for its F-Series trucks and Bronco sport-utility vehicle.\n\"Customers continue to embrace our all-new products, whether it's the F-150, Bronco Sport or Mustang Mach-E,\" said Jim Farley, the company's CEO. \"It's clear Ford is gaining momentum and delivering great value.\"\nThe surge in demand for trucks and SUVs reflected the broader trend in the US auto market. These large vehicles have become increasingly popular as low gas prices and an improving economy continue to drive sales of larger, more expensive cars.\nHowever, the good news was overshadowed by significant losses in Ford's European operations. The company reported that its European division had lost $569 million in the quarter, nearly double the amount it lost a year earlier.\nFord's European business has been struggling for years, as it has been hampered by high costs and declining sales. This has led some analysts to question whether Ford can continue to compete effectively in a market where it has struggled to gain traction.\n\"The results in Europe were disappointing and raise concerns about the company's long-term viability in the region,\" said Morningstar analyst David Whiston. \"Ford needs to find a way to reduce costs and increase efficiency if it wants to stay competitive.\"\nFord's executives acknowledged the challenges, but remain optimistic about the future. They said that while the losses in Europe were significant, they were offset by strong performances in other regions, including North America and Asia.\n\"The European market remains challenging, but we're making progress, and we're committed to delivering sustainable profitability there,\" said Farley.\nOne area where Ford sees potential for growth is in electric vehicles. The company is currently investing heavily in EV technology and plans to launch several new electric models in the coming years.\nEarlier this year, Ford unveiled its new Mustang Mach-E electric crossover, which has received positive reviews from both customers and critics. The company hopes the Mach-E will help to shift public perceptions of EVs as being slow and boring to drive, and instead make them more appealing to a wider audience.\n\"We see electric as a huge opportunity for us, and we're investing to win,\" Farley said. \"We've got a lot of great new products coming, and we're confident that they will help us continue to grow and succeed in the years ahead.\"\nOverall, analysts say that despite the losses in Europe, Ford's strong performance in other markets, coupled with its commitment to EVs, bodes well for its future.\n\"They're facing some headwinds, but Ford has a lot of strengths that should help them weather the storm,\" said Whiston. \"They've got a great brand, a loyal customer base, and a lot of new technology in the pipeline. With the right strategy and execution, I think they can continue to thrive.\"", "McDonald's Corporation is taking steps to fix its U.S. market issues with the appointment of a new chairman of domestic business, Joe Erlinger. The fast-food giant announced the move to create this new position across its U.S. business to help address some of the challenges the company has been facing.\nErlinger, who has worked at McDonald's for over two decades, will begin his new role on November 1, according to an official statement. He will be responsible for overseeing all of McDonald's operations in the U.S. market, including about 14,000 restaurants.\nThe announcement comes at a critical time for McDonald's, which has been struggling to stay competitive in an increasingly crowded fast-food market. Factors such as changes in consumer behavior, the rise of e-commerce and technological advancements that have led to the modernization of restaurants have all contributed to the challenges faced by the industry giant.\nErlinger's appointment, however, shows that McDonald's is committed to fixing the challenges it faces. Erlinger is a seasoned executive who has been a key figure in McDonald's global business, where he has served as president of the international operated markets division. He has also worked in various roles in the company, including as chief restaurant officer in the US.\n\"Joe is a respected leader who is passionate about our brand and the experience we provide our customers, and we are confident he is the right person to lead our domestic business,\" Chris Kempczinski, McDonald's CEO, said in a statement.\nAs chairman of the domestic business, Erlinger will focus on strengthening McDonald's relationships with its franchisees, improving the customer experience and delivering on the company's growth opportunities.

A combination of strong leadership, innovation, and franchisee collaboration will be key in meeting the company's goals and addressing the challenges faced in the coming years.", "The Hong Kong air cargo market rates have continued to rise despite eased demand and additional capacity, according to a recent report by Reuters. The report indicates that Hong Kong's air cargo industry has been experiencing unprecedented growth in recent years, leading to an increase in demand for air cargo services and facilities.\nDespite the global economic slowdown, trade between Hong Kong and other countries has remained strong, especially in the e-commerce sector. As a result, cargo airlines and freight carriers have expanded their services, adding more capacity to meet the growing demand. However, rates for air cargo services have continued to rise steadily.\nThe reasons behind the continued rise in air cargo rates in Hong Kong are complex. The Reuters report suggests that air cargo operators are maintaining high rates to offset the rising costs of security and handling, especially for hazardous materials. Additionally, Hong Kong's air cargo industry is facing intense competition from other global hubs, forcing operators to find new ways to maintain profitability.\nIndustry experts point out that the rise in air cargo rates in Hong Kong is hurting the competitiveness of the city as a global logistics hub. Despite having a world-class airport and state-of-the-art cargo facilities, the high rates are driving customers to other locations, such as Singapore and Shanghai, which offer lower prices. This could have significant long-term implications for Hong Kong's economy, which heavily relies on the logistics industry.\nThe report by Reuters also highlights the impact of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong on the city's air cargo industry. Over the past year, the protests have disrupted the operations of the airport and caused delays and cancellations of flights. This has further increased the costs for cargo operators who need to secure their cargo during transit. The protests, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused a significant drop in passenger traffic, hurting the bottom lines of the airlines.\nDespite the challenges, Hong Kong's air cargo industry remains optimistic about its future. The city is taking steps to address the competitiveness issue by offering incentives to attract more freight carriers. For example, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has launched a HK$2 billion fund to subsidize air cargo companies to help weather the global economic downturn. Additionally, the Hong Kong International Airport is investing in new technologies, such as blockchain, to improve the speed and security of cargo transactions.\nLooking ahead, the Reuters report suggests that Hong Kong's air cargo industry will continue to face challenges as the global economy remains uncertain. However, the city's strategic location and world-class infrastructure give it a competitive advantage over other logistics hubs. With the right policies and investments, Hong Kong can maintain its position as a leading air cargo hub and support the growth of its economy.", "Time Warner Inc. has reported a 32% increase in its third-quarter earnings, driven by strong performance in its media and entertainment segments. The company's net income for the quarter surged to $1.5 billion, up from $1.1 billion in the same period last year.\nThe growth was fueled by an increase in revenue from its Warner Bros. studios and premium cable channel HBO, as well as gains in its Turner Broadcasting unit. Warner Bros. benefited from the successful box office runs of the superhero films \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Justice League,\" while HBO saw growth in subscriptions due to popular shows such as \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Westworld.\"\n\"We had a strong quarter, with solid revenue and operating income growth across our businesses,\" said Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes in a statement. \"We continue to invest in and deliver the highest-quality content to audiences around the world, and we're well-positioned for the future.\"\nIn addition to its robust financial results, Time Warner also revealed plans to simplify its corporate structure and reduce its debt. The company intends to spin off its cable channels - including CNN, TNT, and TBS - into a separate company, to be named WarnerMedia. The move is expected to help Time Warner focus on its core media and entertainment businesses, while also reducing its debt load.\nThe restructuring will involve a one-time payment of $1.8 billion, which Time Warner expects to fund through a combination of debt and cash. The company also plans to repurchase $2 billion worth of its shares by the end of this year, as part of a larger $5 billion buyback program that was announced last year.\n\"We believe that separating our cable channels from our content creation businesses will allow each company to focus on what it does best, and to operate more effectively and efficiently,\" explained Bewkes. \"At the same time, we're committed to reducing our debt, which will give us greater financial flexibility and enable us to invest in our future growth.\"\nDespite the positive news, Time Warner's shares fell slightly in after-hours trading, as investors expressed concerns about the company's proposed merger with telecom giant AT&T. The deal, which was announced last year, is currently being reviewed by the Department of Justice, which has raised antitrust concerns.\nSome analysts have suggested that the proposed merger could fail, or could result in significant concessions for the companies involved. However, Bewkes remained optimistic in his comments on the matter.\n\"We continue to believe that the combination of Time Warner and AT&T will create a compelling new company with unprecedented capabilities and resources,\" he said. \"We're confident in the value that this merger will bring to our shareholders and to consumers, and we look forward to working with AT&T to bring it to fruition.\"\nIn summary, Time Warner's strong third-quarter results and plans to simplify its corporate structure and reduce debt have positioned the company well for the future. Despite some concerns about its proposed merger with AT&T, Time Warner remains confident in its growth potential and ability to deliver high-quality content to audiences worldwide.", "Cowie Group, a leading leasing and fleet management company, has been approached by an unnamed defence vehicle manufacturer to form a joint venture for leasing military equipment to the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The move comes as the MOD looks to modernise its vehicle fleet.\nThe Cowie Group is a well-established player in the UK fleet management and leasing market, with a strong track record of providing high-quality service and innovative solutions to public and private sector customers. The company has a reputation for flexibility and responsiveness, which has attracted a wide range of clients, including large corporations, government agencies and local authorities.\nThe proposed joint venture would see Cowie Group and the defence vehicle manufacturer leasing a range of military vehicles and equipment, including armoured vehicles, tanks and helicopters, to the MOD. The aim of the partnership is to ensure that the MOD has access to the latest and most advanced defence equipment, whilst also helping to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\nThe Cowie Group has welcomed the approach, seeing it as an opportunity to expand its business into new and exciting areas of the market.

Working with the private sector can often bring significant benefits in terms of efficiency, cost savings and access to cutting-edge technology.\u201d\nThe deal is still in its early stages, and many details are yet to be finalised. However, both Cowie Group and the defence vehicle manufacturer are said to be keen to move forward with the proposal, and are looking to secure the necessary approvals and funding as soon as possible.\nIf successful, the joint venture could pave the way for similar partnerships between the private sector and the MOD, as the ministry looks to modernise its equipment and improve its efficiency in the coming years.", "For decades, Russia was known as the breadbasket of the world. With an abundance of fertile land and favorable weather conditions, the country had a near-monopoly on the global grain trade. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the liberalization of the agricultural sector, opening up the market to private enterprise. While this shift has resulted in some benefits for consumers and farmers alike, it has also created significant challenges for Russian grain traders who are struggling to adapt to the new economic reality.\nThe biggest obstacle facing Russian grain traders are the structural inefficiencies of the country's agricultural sector. Unlike in many other countries, Russian farms are typically small and highly fragmented, making it difficult to achieve economies of scale and to coordinate production and distribution. Moreover, the lack of investment in infrastructure means that many rural areas still lack basic amenities like reliable electricity and transportation links, making it tough to transport and store large quantities of grain.\nTo compound these problems, the transition to a free market economy has led to an influx of foreign competitors into the Russian market. Western grain traders like Cargill and ADM have been particularly active, attracted by the country's large land mass and favorable export conditions. These multinational firms have access to greater resources and expertise than their Russian counterparts, making it difficult for domestic traders to compete on price and quality.\nDespite these challenges, there are some reasons for optimism in the Russian grain industry. One of the most encouraging trends is the emergence of farmers' cooperatives, which allow small-scale growers to pool their resources and improve their bargaining power. These organizations can help to overcome some of the inefficiencies of the Russian agricultural sector by creating economies of scale and reducing transaction costs. By working together and sharing resources, farmers can also access training and support services that would be difficult to find on their own.\nAnother source of hope is the growing market for organic and specialty grains. Increasingly health- and environmentally-conscious consumers are willing to pay a premium for high-quality, locally grown produce. This trend is benefiting small-scale growers and independent traders who can offer differentiated products that are not available in the mass market. By focusing on niche markets, these traders can avoid direct competition with the multinational firms and carve out a profitable market segment for themselves.\nOverall, however, the challenges facing the Russian grain trade are significant and will require sustained effort and investment to overcome. The government will need to play an active role in providing support and incentives for small-scale growers and traders, particularly in rural areas where infrastructure is lacking. In addition, the industry will need to accelerate its adoption of new technologies and best practices to remain competitive in the global market.\nOne potential solution to these challenges is the development of vertical integration, where companies control all stages of production and distribution, from farm to table. This approach, which has been successful in other countries like the United States and Brazil, can help to minimize transaction costs and ensure quality control across the value chain. By consolidating the industry and reducing fragmentation, Russia's grain traders could better compete with multinational firms.\nFurthermore, the adoption of precision agriculture technologies, such as drones and sensors, could help to address some of the inefficiencies in the sector. These technologies can help farmers to optimize their use of resources, improve crop yields, and increase efficiency in all stages of production.\nDespite the challenges, the Russian grain industry still has enormous potential. With its vast land mass, rich soil, and favorable weather conditions, the country has a natural advantage in the global agricultural market. However, to fully realize this potential, the industry will need to overcome the structural challenges that have hampered its development in the past. By focusing on innovation and efficiency, and by working together to strengthen the entire value chain, Russian grain traders may yet flourish in the newly free market.", "BP Gives Lukewarm Reception to Colombian Proposal for Piedemonte Field\nBP, the multinational oil and gas giant, has expressed a lukewarm response to the Colombian government's proposal regarding the Piedemonte field. The proposal was to develop new resources in the area to increase oil and gas production, which BP has presence in.\nIn a statement, BP said that while they appreciated the government's interest in attracting new investment, the company needed to study the proposal further before making any decision. \"It is important that any proposed investment must be economically feasible and sustainable,\" the statement reads.\nThe Piedemonte field is located in the Llanos Basin, an area shared between Colombia and Venezuela. It has been a major source of oil and gas for Colombia for many years and the government is keen to develop new resources in the area. The Colombian government had approached BP to take part in the development of the new resources and to increase their presence in the country's energy sector.\nHowever, BP has been cautious in its approach to this proposal. The company has faced major legal battles and controversies in the past after oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico. This has led to the company investing heavily in safety and sustainability, which is important for its reputation and investor confidence.\nBP will need to conduct a thorough assessment of the proposal to ensure that it is in line with the company's sustainability plans and that any investment is economically feasible. The company has also emphasized the need for a stable investment environment and a clear regulatory framework, which are key to meeting their investment criteria.\nThe Colombian government has been working to address these concerns by highlighting the advantages of investing in the Piedemonte field. The government has pointed out that the Llanos Basin has a long history of oil and gas production, with proven resources and infrastructure already in place. They have also emphasized the country's commitment to environmental sustainability and the importance of engaging local communities in the process.\nDespite this, BP has remained cautious in its approach and has not made a final decision on the proposal. Experts believe that BP's response to the Colombian government's proposal reflects a broader trend in the oil and gas industry, where companies are increasingly prioritizing sustainability and social responsibility in their investment decisions.\nAs the world transitions to a low-carbon economy, companies like BP are looking for opportunities to invest in renewable energy and reduce their carbon footprint. This has led to a shift away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable forms of energy, such as wind, solar, and electric vehicles.\nThe Colombian government's proposal for the Piedemonte field, while aimed at increasing oil and gas production, will need to take into account these global trends if it hopes to attract multinational companies like BP. It will also need to address concerns around sustainability and social responsibility to ensure a stable investment climate and secure long-term benefits for the country.\nIn conclusion, while BP's response to the Colombian government's proposal for the Piedemonte field may seem lukewarm, it reflects a broader trend in the industry towards sustainability and social responsibility. As the world moves towards a low-carbon future, it is becoming increasingly clear that companies that prioritize these values will be the ones that succeed in the long term.", "French Utilities Giant Compagnie Generale des Eaux (CGE) has announced its financial results for the 2020 fiscal year which ended on December 31, and it's good news for investors. The company has posted higher profits, outperforming market expectations despite the challenging conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCGE ended the year with revenues of \u20ac47.2 billion, a modest 2 percent decline from \u20ac48.2 billion in 2019. However, it saw a 5 percent increase in net operating profits, which amounted to \u20ac2.5 billion, up from \u20ac2.3 billion in the previous year. The company also reported an 8 percent rise in net profits, which totaled \u20ac1.5 billion.\nThe results were primarily driven by strong performances from its businesses in water and waste management, which remain the core areas of CGE's operations. The water division saw a 3 percent increase in revenues, while waste management revenues were up by 5 percent. However, the company's construction business saw a 19 percent decline in revenues as a result of the pandemic and economic uncertainty.\nIn response to the challenging market conditions, CGE has announced plans to reorganize its construction business, with the aim of improving its profitability and efficiency. The company said it will combine its construction activities under a single entity, which will be focused on delivering projects in France and select international markets.\nThe move will see the creation of a new business segment, CGE Construction, which will bring together three existing building companies \u2013 Eiffage Construction, Bouygues Construction, and Vinci Construction. The new entity will be headed by Frederic Imbrecht, who will report directly to the CGE group's CEO, Philippe Varin.\n\"We are convinced that a single construction entity with a clear, strategic focus will be better equipped to address the market challenges that lie ahead,\" said Varin in a statement. \"By bringing together Eiffage, Bouygues, and Vinci, we aim to leverage their complementary strengths and create a leaner, more efficient construction business.\"\nCGE's move comes at a time when the French construction industry is facing a difficult environment marked by slow economic growth and intense competition. The industry has also been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many construction projects to be put on hold due to social distancing measures and supply chain disruptions.\nWhile the pandemic has caused significant disruption to CGE's operations, the company has remained resilient thanks to its diversified business model, which spans a range of essential services. In addition to water and waste management and construction, CGE also operates in energy, transportation, and urban services.\nLooking ahead, the company said it is well-positioned to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and play a leading role in the French government's drive to decarbonize the economy by 2050. CGE has already set itself ambitious targets to reduce its carbon footprint, including a pledge to become carbon-neutral by 2050.\nCGE's shares rose by around 1 percent in early trading on Monday following the release of its results and reorganization plans for its construction business. The company's announcement was welcomed by investors, who see it as a positive step towards improving profitability and capturing new market opportunities.\nCGE's success underscores the importance of adapting to changing market conditions and embracing new business models to remain competitive in today's fast-paced and uncertain world. By focusing on its core strengths and leveraging its diversified business model, CGE has demonstrated that it's possible to weather the storm and emerge even stronger on the other side.", "BT, the UK's largest telecommunications company, has recently announced its second quarter earnings, which beat expectations and showed a strong performance across all its business units. However, the announcement did little to quell the ongoing debate surrounding the potential merger between BT and O2.\nWhile some analysts believe the merger will create a stronger competitor in the telecommunications market, others are concerned about the potential impact on competition and consumer choice.\nBT's Q2 earnings show a revenue increase of 8% to \u00a35.5bn, driven by strong growth in its consumer and enterprise units. The company's consumer unit saw revenue growth of 13%, while its enterprise unit saw growth of 3%. BT's global services unit also showed signs of recovery, with revenue growth of 2%.\nBT's CEO, Philip Jansen, attributed the strong performance to the company's continued investment in network infrastructure and its focus on delivering high-quality customer service.\n\"BT's strong performance in the second quarter clearly demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to grow in an uncertain environment,\" he said. \"Our relentless focus on delivering the best possible experience for our customers, combined with our ongoing investment in network infrastructure, means we are well positioned for future growth.\"\nHowever, the positive earnings report did little to ease concerns about the potential merger between BT and O2, which is currently being reviewed by the UK's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nProponents of the merger argue that it will create a stronger competitor in the market, as BT will be able to combine its fixed-line and mobile services with O2's strong mobile offering.\nThe merger would also allow BT to better compete with other major players in the market, such as Vodafone and Three, who already offer both fixed-line and mobile services.\nHowever, opponents of the merger argue that it would reduce competition and limit consumer choice, as the combined company would have too much market share.\nThe CMA is currently conducting a review of the merger, with a decision expected to be announced early next year. In the meantime, analysts and industry experts remain split on the potential impact of the merger.\nSome believe that the merger will create a more efficient company that can better compete in the market, while others argue that it will harm competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.\nAccording to Kester Mann, director of consumer and connectivity at CCS Insight, a technology research firm, the merger could have positive benefits for both companies.\n\"BT has struggled to make an impact in the mobile market and a tie-up with O2 would give it the scale and expertise to mount a much stronger challenge to the likes of Vodafone and Three,\" he said. \"For O2, the attraction of the deal is less clear-cut, but it would benefit from BT's fixed line infrastructure and advanced 5G network.\"\nHowever, other analysts remain skeptical of the benefits of the merger. According to Matthew Howett, founder of the research firm Assembly, the merger would reduce competition in the market and limit consumer choice.\n\"BT already has a dominant position in the broadband market, and a merger with O2 would give it an equally dominant position in the mobile market,\" he said. \"This would reduce competition and limit consumer choice, which is never a good thing.\"\nDespite the ongoing debate surrounding the merger, BT remains focused on its strategic priorities, including investment in network infrastructure and delivering high-quality customer service.\n\"We are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our customers, and we will continue to invest in our network and our people to achieve this goal,\" said Jansen. \"We are confident that our strong performance in the second quarter, combined with our ongoing focus on our strategic priorities, will position us for success in the future.\"", "On Wednesday, a U.S. District Court judge has blocked the new federal regulations that allow credit unions to expand their membership. The ruling is a major setback for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which had hoped to promote credit unions' growth.\nThe decision was made by Judge Dabney Friedrich, who agreed with the arguments presented by the American Bankers Association (ABA), that the NCUA had overstepped its legal authority with the new regulation. The ABA had filed a lawsuit against the NCUA last year, claiming the new rules allowed credit unions to exceed their mandated scope of membership.\nCredit unions are financial cooperatives that are owned by their members and offer similar services and products as traditional banks. Credit unions traditionally served specific fields of membership such as employees of a particular company or members of a specific organization. However, over the years, credit union membership has been expanding through the inclusion of new groups.\nThe NCUA had issued the new regulation in October 2016, which allowed credit unions to expand their membership beyond the mandated field of membership. The rule permitted credit unions to serve entire communities instead of just a specific group. The regulation was seen as a major victory for credit unions that had been fighting to expand their membership base for years.\nThe ABA challenged the NCUA's authority to issue such a regulation, arguing that the agency had exceeded its statutory authority in allowing credit unions to expand their membership beyond their mandated scope. The judge agreed with the ABA and ruled that the NCUA had acted beyond their power.\nThe ABA said in a statement, \"We are pleased that the court recognized the NCUA's overreach and struck down this illegal rule.\" The association also said that it would continue to fight against any regulatory overreach by the NCUA.\nCredit unions, on the other hand, are disappointed with the ruling, as they believe that it would have allowed them to better serve their communities and compete with traditional banks. Credit unions have argued that expanding their membership was necessary to stay competitive and meet the financial needs of a rapidly changing society.\nCredit Union National Association (CUNA), which represents credit unions, said in a statement that the ruling would hurt consumers and weaken credit unions' ability to provide affordable financial services. \"Credit unions will continue the fight to remove regulatory obstacles that prevent them from serving their communities to the fullest extent,\" the statement read.\nThe ruling is a setback for the NCUA, which had hoped to promote credit unions' growth and ensure that they remain a viable alternative to traditional banks. However, the agency said that it would comply with the court's decision.\nThe NCUA also said that it would evaluate its options and decide on the appropriate course of action. The agency said that it would continue to work towards regulatory changes that would promote safety and soundness in the credit union system while ensuring that consumers have access to affordable financial services.\nThe ruling is expected to have a significant impact on credit unions' growth and their ability to serve their communities. However, credit unions have vowed to continue to fight for regulatory changes that would allow them to expand their membership and better serve their communities.\nIn conclusion, the U.S. District Court's decision to bar new federal regulations allowing for credit union membership expansion is a major setback for credit unions and their ability to compete with traditional banks. This ruling is expected to have a significant impact on credit unions' growth and their ability to serve their communities. However, credit unions have vowed to continue to fight for regulatory changes that would allow them to expand their membership and better serve their communities. It remains to be seen the NCUA's next moves towards addressing this issue.", "The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sought intervention from the Supreme Court to lift the suspension on federal rules for local telephone competition. The move is aimed at promoting increased competition and innovation in the telecommunications industry.\nThe suspension of the federal rules, known as the \u201cUnlocking the Gridlock\u201d rules, was put in place by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2017. The rules were designed to promote competition between local telephone service providers and increase access to broadband services in underserved areas.\nThe DOJ argues that the suspension of the rules has stymied competition in the telecommunications industry, resulting in higher prices and reduced innovation. The department also argues that the suspension has prevented smaller service providers from entering the market, thus limiting consumer choice.\n\u201cCompetition is vital to maintaining an innovative and robust telecommunications industry that serves all Americans,\u201d said Attorney General William P. Barr. \u201cThe suspension of the Unlocking the Gridlock rules has had a negative impact on competition in the industry, and we are seeking the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention to lift the suspension and promote increased competition.\u201d\nThe DOJ notes that the telecommunications industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, with new technologies and services emerging that were not contemplated when the original rules were put in place. The department believes that the rules should be updated to take into account these changes and promote competition and innovation in the industry.\nThe \u201cUnlocking the Gridlock\u201d rules were put in place in 1996 as part of the Telecommunications Act. The rules were designed to promote competition in the local telephone service industry, which at the time was dominated by a handful of large companies.\nThe rules required incumbent local exchange carriers to share their telephone networks with competitors, allowing new companies to enter the market and compete on an equal footing. The rules also required incumbent carriers to offer access to their networks at wholesale rates, enabling smaller companies to offer competitive pricing to customers.\nThe FCC suspended the rules in 2017, citing concerns that they were no longer necessary in a market that had become more competitive. The move was met with criticism from consumer advocacy groups and smaller service providers, who argued that the suspension would lead to higher prices and reduced competition.\nThe DOJ\u2019s request for Supreme Court intervention is seen as a significant step in the ongoing debate over the future of the telecommunications industry. The court is expected to hear the case later this year, with a ruling likely to have far-reaching implications for the industry and consumers alike.", "Eco-terrorism Strikes at British Construction Giants: Activists Target Profit Margins in New Form of Business Risk\nIn recent years, environmental activists have been stepping up their efforts to combat climate change and defend the planet against ecological destruction caused by big corporations. For traditional industries, this has meant that business risk has taken on a new form - one that they are increasingly ill-equipped to handle.\nMost recently, British construction giants have been hit hard by a wave of eco-terrorism, with protestors actively targeting their profit margins. These corporations have been accused of engaging in unsustainable development practices such as deforestation, overproduction of building materials, waste dumping, and the use of non-renewable resources.\nIn response, a growing coalition of environmental activists have started taking more radical steps to disrupt the operations of these companies, in order to drive change and force them to adopt more responsible business practices. The tactics employed by these activists range from peaceful protests and awareness-raising initiatives to civil disobedience, sabotage, and even outright violence.\nOne of the most notorious eco-terrorist groups operating in the UK today is Extinction Rebellion (XR). XR has gained a reputation for its disruptive tactics that often involve blocking roads and causing mass disruptions in highly visible public spaces. In early 2020, the group staged a series of high-profile protests at some of the country's biggest airports, which drew widespread media attention and generated intense public debate.\nAnother significant player in the eco-terrorism movement is Earth First! UK, a radical environmentalist group that has been involved in a number of direct-action campaigns against major corporations. The group has targeted companies in the mining, logging, and oil industries, as well as agricultural companies engaged in destructive activities such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and intensive farming methods.\nBeyond these groups, there are countless other smaller activist groups and individuals working to disrupt the operations of big corporations and increase public awareness of unsustainable business practices. These groups use a variety of tactics, ranging from high-profile media stunts to clandestine sabotage operations.\nSome experts argue that eco-terrorism is an inevitable corollary of the failure of traditional protest methods. For years, activists have resorted to peaceful protests and lobbying efforts to try and bring about meaningful change in the private sector. However, all too often, their efforts have been met with resistance and intransigence from corporations, governments, and the public.\nThis has led to frustration and disillusionment among many activists who feel that traditional methods of protest are no longer effective in the face of the urgent crisis posed by climate change and ecological destruction.\nAccording to a report published by the non-profit group Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV), eco-terrorism has become an increasingly prominent threat to businesses around the world.\nThe report notes that \"eco-terrorists are increasingly using tactics that directly target the economic interests of corporations, such as disrupting supply chains or damaging infrastructure. This represents a shift from the traditional focus on symbolic acts of sabotage or publicity stunts.\"\nThe report highlights a number of case studies from around the world where eco-terrorist groups have succeeded in significantly impacting the operations of major corporations through targeted campaigns of sabotage and disruption.\nOne example cited in the report is the campaign by the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) against the logging industry in the US. The group was responsible for a series of arson attacks on logging facilities and other infrastructure throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, causing tens of millions of dollars in damage.\nDespite efforts by law enforcement agencies to crack down on eco-terrorism, experts warn that the phenomenon is likely to continue to grow in the coming years, particularly with the increasing urgency of the climate crisis.\nTo mitigate the risks posed by eco-terrorism, businesses and governments will need to find more effective ways to engage with environmental activists and address their concerns. This will require a willingness to listen to the voices of those calling for action and to make meaningful changes to business practices and policies in response.\nAt the same time, businesses will need to take proactive steps to protect themselves against eco-terrorism by investing in stronger security measures and emergency response plans that can help them quickly and effectively respond to threats.\nUltimately, the fight against eco-terrorism represents just one aspect of the larger struggle to combat climate change and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. As businesses and governments work to address this pressing issue, they must be prepared to engage with all stakeholders and to find innovative solutions that can help them navigate the complex risks and challenges ahead.", "Britain and China have agreed to introduce a new anti-espionage law in Hong Kong to address concerns over national security. However, both countries have also expressed caution against making major legal changes to the city before the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.\nThe announcement was made during the first round of talks between Britain and China over Hong Kong's future. The meeting, which took place in London, was attended by senior officials from both countries, including China's Deputy Foreign Minister, Qin Gang, and Britain's Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab.\nThe new law will be aimed at preventing foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs, particularly from countries that do not have legitimate interests in the city. It will also include provisions to address cyber security and espionage.\nSpeaking at a press conference after the talks, Qin Gang said that the law would \"strengthen Hong Kong's defense against espionage and other illicit acts, and promote national security.\"\nHowever, both China and Britain warned against making any major legal changes to Hong Kong's autonomy before the 1997 handover, which will mark 50 years since the city became a special administrative region of China. The two countries also renewed their commitment to the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which allows Hong Kong to maintain a separate legal system from mainland China.\nRaab said he had raised concerns about the proposed changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, which would allow the Chinese government to select the city's leaders. He said Britain wanted to see a \"genuine choice\" for the people of Hong Kong and that the electoral system should be \"inclusive and democratic.\"\nQin Gang said that China was \"committed to the sound and steady implementation of the'one country, two systems' principle\" and that the changes to Hong Kong's electoral system were \"necessary and justified.\"\nThe talks also covered economic issues, including the possibility of a free trade agreement between Britain and China. Qin Gang said that China was \"willing to speed up the negotiations\" but added that there were \"still some differences\" between the two countries.\nThe talks come amid growing tensions between China and the West over issues such as human rights, trade, and the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, Britain offered residency and later citizenship to up to three million Hong Kong residents following China's imposition of a controversial national security law in the city.\nThe new anti-espionage law is likely to be seen as a further attempt by China to tighten its grip on Hong Kong. Critics have accused Beijing of eroding the city's autonomy and suppressing dissent.\nIn a joint statement, China and Britain said that they had \"productive and frank discussions\" and that they remained \"committed to working together to promote stability and prosperity in the region.\" However, the statement also acknowledged that there were \"complex issues\" to be addressed and that \"constructive dialogue\" was needed.", "In a recent press conference, the Czech National Bank Governor announced his commitment to keeping the crown strong despite calls for depreciation to boost exports.\nGovernor Ji\u0159\u00ed Rusnok acknowledged the increased pressure on the country's exports, but emphasized that the strength of the currency was equally important in maintaining a stable economy.\n\"Although a weaker crown might help boost exports in the short term, it would ultimately lead to higher inflation and instability in the long term,\" stated Governor Rusnok.\nHe further elaborated on the potential risks associated with currency depreciation, citing increased borrowing costs and decreased investor confidence as just some of the potential consequences.\nRusnok's announcement comes as a response to growing concerns from Czech businesses over the strength of the crown, which has risen significantly in recent years. This has made Czech exports more expensive and less competitive in international markets.\nDespite these concerns, the Governor emphasized that the Czech National Bank remains committed to maintaining an independent monetary policy that prioritizes overall economic stability above short-term goals.\n\"Our goal is to keep inflation low and stable while supporting economic growth and employment,\" he said.\nThe Governor's announcement was met with mixed reactions from the business community. While some commended the government's focus on stability, others expressed disappointment in the lack of action to address the current challenges facing Czech exports.\n\"The strong crown is hurting our ability to compete in international markets, and we need more support from the government to address this issue,\" said one business owner who wished to remain anonymous.\nDespite these criticisms, Governor Rusnok remained steadfast in his commitment to an independent monetary policy, saying that the bank would continue to monitor the situation closely and make adjustments as needed.\n\"We will remain vigilant in our efforts to balance the needs of the economy with the long-term stability of the country's financial system,\" he concluded.\nIn conclusion, the Czech National Bank Governor's recent announcement reinforces the importance of maintaining a strong currency and independent monetary policy in a rapidly changing economic landscape. While the challenges facing Czech exports are real, it is evident that the government remains committed to ensuring stable economic growth for all stakeholders.", "The sugar industry in China has finally stabilized after several years of turbulence, bringing a sigh of relief to executives and traders alike. The market has enjoyed a more steady and comfortable run in recent months, aided in part by the country's recent decision to stop imports of high fructose corn syrup.\nThis move by the Chinese government has been critically important to the sugar industry, as it has helped to reduce the glut in high fructose corn syrup in China and thus enabled producers to focus on increasing their sugar yields. Additionally, the government's crackdown on food safety violations and its drive to shift towards healthier, more natural sweeteners has also benefited the sugar industry immensely.\nOne major factor that has also played a significant role in the recovery of the sugar market is the increasing demand from China's growing middle class population. Chinese consumers are becoming more health-conscious and are increasingly seeking out natural sweeteners like cane sugar and honey over high fructose corn syrup. This has driven up demand for sugar and put upward pressure on prices, thereby creating a more stable market environment.\nIndustry analysts predict that sugar prices in China are likely to remain stable in the near future, with potential for some upward movement in the coming year. This outlook bodes well for sugar producers and traders, who have struggled for several years with volatility in the market and frequent price fluctuations.\nNotably, the sugar industry in China has also seen a significant increase in foreign investment in recent years. Leading international firms like Wilmar, Bunge, and Cargill have all invested heavily in China's sugar sector, attracted by the country's large and rapidly growing market for sweeteners.\nOverall, the stabilization of China's sugar market is a positive development for the industry and for the country's broader economy. It is likely to stimulate investment, promote innovation and further improve food safety while offering consumers a wider selection of healthier, more natural sweeteners. This in turn will help to support and promote the growth of the wider food and beverage industry, creating new opportunities for both traditional and new players in this dynamic and rapidly changing market.", "Former Barings executive Ron Baker is denying the lawsuit filed by ING Barings over an alleged loan repayment. Baker, who served as the deputy chief executive officer of Barings Securities, has been accused of failing to repay a loan worth $2.5 million.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that Baker was loaned $2.5 million by ING Barings in 2007, which he failed to repay. The loan was reportedly used to invest in the stock market, but the value of the investments declined, and Baker was unable to repay the loan.\nBaker, who left Barings in 2009, denies the allegations and claims that the loan was repaid. In a statement, Baker's attorney said that the lawsuit is \"without merit\" and that Baker is \"confident that he will be vindicated.\"\nThe lawsuit is the latest development in a long-running legal battle between Baker and ING Barings. In 2013, Baker was sued by the bank for allegedly breaching his fiduciary duties by allowing a trader to take huge risks without proper oversight. Baker denied the allegations and said that he was not responsible for the trader's actions.\nThe case was settled out of court in 2016, with Baker agreeing to pay ING Barings $3.5 million. However, the latest lawsuit suggests that the legal battle between Baker and the bank is far from over.\nThe lawsuit comes at a time when the banking industry is facing increased scrutiny over its practices. The collapse of Barings in 1995, which was caused by rogue trader Nick Leeson, is still regarded as one of the most significant events in the history of the financial industry.\nIn conclusion, it remains to be seen how this latest legal battle will play out, and whether Baker will be vindicated or forced to pay the loan. The case serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in the financial industry and the need for executives to act in the best interests of their clients and stakeholders.", "The leadership contest in Hong Kong was met with pro-democracy protests that rocked the city. The demonstrations took place ahead of the 2022 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, which will determine the city's next leader.\nThe protests began on Sunday, with thousands taking to the streets to demand universal suffrage and an end to China's influence in Hong Kong's politics. Protesters rallied outside government buildings, chanting slogans calling for democracy and an end to perceived political improprieties.\nThe leadership contest has been a contentious issue in Hong Kong for years. Critics of the current system argue that the election process is undemocratic and that the city's leaders are beholden to Beijing. They have called for an overhaul of the system, with reforms that would allow for greater transparency and accountability.\nPro-democracy protesters are also upset about the growing influence of China in Hong Kong's affairs. Many believe that Beijing is undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and eroding the city's freedoms, including freedom of speech and the press.\nDespite the demonstrators' calls for change, the Hong Kong government has remained staunchly supportive of the current electoral system. Officials have said that the election process is fair and transparent, and that the city's leaders are committed to upholding Hong Kong's autonomy.\nHowever, pro-democracy activists disagree. They say that the system is broken and that the election process is rigged in favor of Hong Kong's pro-Beijing establishment. They have called for a more representative system that would give all Hong Kong residents a say in who leads the city.\nThe leadership contest has also drawn international attention. The United States and other Western countries have expressed concern about the state of democracy in Hong Kong and the influence of China in the city's politics. Critics have accused Beijing of using Hong Kong as a testing ground for its authoritarian policies, aimed at crushing dissent and controlling the information flow.\nThe Chinese government has denied these accusations, saying that it respects Hong Kong's autonomy and has no intention of interfering in the city's affairs. However, this claim has been met with skepticism by many in the international community, who see the leadership contest as a key battleground in the ongoing struggle between democracy and authoritarianism.\nDespite the protests, the leadership contest has moved forward. The current front-runner is Carrie Lam, a former chief secretary of Hong Kong and a staunch supporter of Beijing. Lam has been criticized by pro-democracy activists, who say that she is too closely aligned with the city's pro-Beijing establishment.\nProtests are expected to continue throughout the leadership contest, with demonstrators calling for an end to China's influence in Hong Kong's politics. In the meantime, Hong Kong residents are left to wonder what the future holds for their city and their freedoms.\nAs the world watches, Hong Kong's democracy hangs in the balance. While Beijing remains intent on retaining its grip on the city, pro-democracy activists continue to fight for their rights and freedoms. With the leadership contest looming, the stakes have never been higher. Only time will tell what the future holds for Hong Kong and its people.", "Regulators have put forward a proposal to provide $2.3bn in funding to connect schools and libraries across the United States to the internet at heavily discounted rates. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has outlined the ConnectED program, which aims to connect 20 million students to high-speed internet by 2020.\nThe FCC has acknowledged that internet connectivity is essential for students to succeed in the 21st century. It is not only a tool for education but also for job prospects and economic growth. In a statement, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said: \u201cThe new proposal is a smart, forward-thinking and responsible step that delivers on the promise to make sure every student, no matter where they live or what their circumstances, has access to the tools they need to succeed.\u201d\nThe proposal is set to provide a ray of hope for several schools and libraries that are still operating below internet speeds required by the FCC. The recent proposal, which was approved in March 2016, amends the existing E-Rate program, established in 1996 to subsidize phone service in schools and libraries. The new proposal supports broadband services and Wi-Fi connections to the same institutions.\nThe ConnectED program aims to provide a foundational infrastructure that would allow schools and libraries to use digital resources to enhance their learning and teaching. The funding would also support the development and deployment of new educational technology aimed at improving teaching and learning in the classroom.\nThe ConnectED proposal is set to have far-reaching effects on American students. The program aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in the modern digital age, where internet connectivity is essential. The FCC has suggested that low-income and rural students stand to benefit the most from the program as they face the most significant challenges in getting access to quality internet and broadband services.\nMany schools and libraries in rural communities, which are often remote and have limited resources, will benefit from the ConnectED program. The initiative will provide funding to upgrade internet infrastructure, which will ensure that they can receive the necessary connectivity required for their teaching programs and resources.\nTo ensure equitable distribution of the funds, the FCC is working with states, schools, and libraries to identify areas that are underserved or face challenges in providing internet and broadband services to students. The program aims to provide internet connectivity to every classroom in America by 2018.\nThe ConnectED program also aims to promote digital literacy and responsible use of the internet to students. The proposal intends to provide online safety education, including topics such as cyberbullying and online privacy. Digital literacy and safety remain essential skills for students in the digital age.\nThe ConnectED program has attracted support from various stakeholders, including educational organizations and private sector companies. The program is seen as critical to advancing educational technology and digital learning in America.\nIn conclusion, the ConnectED program is a significant initiative aimed at providing essential internet connectivity to American schools and libraries. It is a much-needed program that will help bridge the digital divide and enable students to succeed in the modern age. The program aims to make it possible for students to access digital resources, support their learning and promote responsible use of the internet. With the FCC's latest proposal, the program is set to achieve its goals and improve student access to quality education.", "Renowned Chinese dissident Wang Dan is facing a harsh sentence for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government, according to reports.\nWang Dan, a former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, has long been a critic of the Chinese government and advocate for democracy. He has been arrested multiple times over the years for his activism and served seven years in prison for his involvement in the pro-democracy movement.\nBut now, Wang Dan is facing one of his biggest challenges yet as he stands accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Beijing accuses him of working with foreign forces to undermine the Chinese Communist Party and foment unrest in the country.\nProsecutors have presented evidence that they claim proves Wang Dan\u2019s guilt, including online chats with other activists and financial transactions that appear to show him receiving funds from abroad. They allege that Wang Dan was planning to organize demonstrations and rallies aimed at destabilizing the government.\nThe accusations against Wang Dan come amid a broader crackdown on dissent in China. Over the past year, the authorities have arrested dozens of activists, journalists, and lawyers in what human rights groups call an alarming escalation of repression.\nWang Dan\u2019s case has attracted international attention, with human rights organizations and foreign governments calling for his release. The United States has condemned the charges against Wang Dan as \u201cbaseless\u201d and urged China to respect his right to free speech and peaceful assembly.\nBut the Chinese authorities have shown no signs of relenting. They have accused Wang Dan of being a \u201ccriminal\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d who is working against the interests of the Chinese people.\nWang Dan\u2019s trial began on Monday, and it is expected to last several days. If found guilty, he could face a lengthy prison sentence.\nThe case has highlighted the increasingly tense relationship between China and the West. The United States and other countries have been critical of Beijing\u2019s human rights record, with some imposing sanctions on Chinese officials over their treatment of Uighur Muslims and democracy activists.\nThe Chinese Communist Party, meanwhile, has accused Western countries of interfering in its internal affairs and attempting to destabilize the country. It has responded with a range of measures, including sanctions against foreign officials and restrictions on foreign organizations.\nObservers say that Wang Dan\u2019s case could have far-reaching implications for China\u2019s political future. If the authorities are successful in silencing him and other dissenters, it could signal a major shift in the country\u2019s political landscape.\nBut others believe that Wang Dan\u2019s case could have the opposite effect by galvanizing opposition to the government and inspiring others to speak out against repression. Many see Wang Dan as a symbol of the struggle for democracy in China and a model for future generations of activists.\nDespite the risks he faces, Wang Dan has remained defiant in his defense. In a statement released before the trial, he said that he was innocent of the charges against him and that he would continue to fight for democracy and human rights in China.\n\u201cI believe that one day China will become a democratic country where people can enjoy freedom of speech and assembly,\u201d Wang Dan said. \u201cI will not give up until that day comes.\u201d\nThe case of Wang Dan is shaping up to be one of the most important political trials in recent years, with potential implications for both China and the international community. As the trial continues, the world will be watching to see what verdict is handed down and what impact it will have on the struggle for democracy and human rights in China.", "In a bold move, one of China's most prominent dissidents and human rights activists has fled the country and sought asylum in Hong Kong before heading to the United States. The move comes amid growing concerns about the increasing suppression of civil and political rights in China.\nThe dissident, Wu Qi, has been a vocal critic of the Chinese government, particularly its treatment of ethnic minorities such as Tibetans and Uighurs. Wu, who is a Uighur himself, has also spoken out against China's growing influence in the world, including its aggressive stance towards Taiwan and Hong Kong.\nWu's decision to flee China was not an easy one, and it was made with great consideration. In an interview with the New York Times, Wu stated that he had been under surveillance for several years and that he feared for his safety and that of his family. \"I knew that if I stayed in China, I would face imprisonment or worse,\" Wu said. \"I had to leave for the sake of my family.\"\nWu's flight to Hong Kong was not without incident. He arrived in the city on a Thursday afternoon and immediately sought the assistance of local human rights organizations. However, he was summoned by Hong Kong immigration officials just hours after his arrival and was questioned about his intentions and his travel documents.\nWu was eventually allowed to stay in Hong Kong while his asylum application was processed. However, he still faced the same concerns he had in China, as Hong Kong has become increasingly subject to China's influence in recent years.\nThe decision to seek asylum in the United States came after many discussions with his family and advisors. Wu knew that the US would provide him with the protection he needed and allow him to continue his work as a human rights advocate.\nAlthough Wu's asylum application is still being processed, his case has already garnered significant support from human rights organizations. Amnesty International has called on Hong Kong authorities to ensure Wu's safety and protect his rights during the asylum process, while Human Rights Watch has praised Wu for his \"bravery and commitment to the principles of human rights.\"\nWhile Wu's case is a victory for human rights advocates, it is also a reminder of the continued suppression of civil and political rights in China. Despite years of economic growth and increased global influence, China's government remains closed off to dissent, and those who speak out against the regime still face severe consequences.\nThe Chinese government has not yet commented on Wu's flight to Hong Kong. However, it is likely that they will view him as a traitor and a threat to their authority. The Chinese government has a long history of cracking down on dissidents, human rights activists, and political opponents, and many believe that Wu's flight is just another example of China's growing authoritarianism.\nThe United States has long been a haven for those seeking freedom and protection from persecution. Wu's case is just the latest example of the country's willingness to protect those who stand up for human rights and civil liberties. As Wu's application for asylum is reviewed, the world will be watching to see if the US stands by its principles and provides him and his family with the protection they need.", "Odwalla Inc. faces recall crisis and potential financial impact after E. coli outbreak linked to apple juice products\nOdwalla Inc. is facing a recall crisis after an E. coli outbreak linked to its apple juice products. The company, which is known for its natural juices and smoothies, has been forced to recall all of its apple juice products after tests showed that they were contaminated with the dangerous strain of E. coli.\nAccording to health officials, the outbreak has sickened at least 16 people across five states. They say that the outbreak is linked to Odwalla apple juice products, which were found to contain the same strain of E. coli that was found in the sickened individuals.\nThis is a major blow to the company, which has built its reputation on producing high-quality, natural juices and smoothies. Many customers are now questioning whether they can trust the company's products, and some are even calling for a boycott.\nThe company has responded to the crisis by issuing a recall of all of its apple juice products, and has promised to work closely with health officials to identify the source of the contamination.\nHowever, the recall is expected to have a significant financial impact on Odwalla. The company is now facing the prospect of lost sales and a damaged reputation, which could take years to repair.\nIn addition, the company is likely to face significant costs associated with the recall, including the cost of disposing of the contaminated products and the cost of testing and retooling its production processes to prevent a similar outbreak from occurring in the future.\nDespite the challenges, Odwalla is vowing to do everything it can to address the situation and restore the trust of its customers. In a statement, the company said:\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by the news of the E. coli outbreak linked to our apple juice products. Our top priority is the health and safety of our customers, and we are working closely with health officials to identify the source of the contamination and take all necessary steps to prevent a similar outbreak in the future. We are committed to doing everything we can to address this situation and restore the trust of our customers.\u201d\nThis is not the first time that Odwalla has faced a recall crisis. In 1996, the company was forced to recall its apple juice products after they were found to be contaminated with E. coli. That outbreak sickened at least 70 people and resulted in one death.\nThe incident led to significant changes at Odwalla, including the implementation of strict safety protocols and the introduction of new testing and monitoring procedures. The company also faced a wave of lawsuits, which resulted in a $15.6 million settlement.\nWhile the company has made significant progress in improving its safety practices over the years, the current outbreak is a stark reminder of the risks that still exist in the food production industry.\nAs consumers become increasingly concerned about food safety, it is critical that companies like Odwalla do everything they can to ensure the safety of their products. This includes investing in new testing and monitoring technologies, implementing strict safety protocols, and holding themselves and their suppliers to the highest standards of safety and quality.\nThe current outbreak is a wake-up call to the entire industry, and a reminder of the importance of keeping food safety at the forefront of everything we do. It is time for all of us to redouble our efforts and work together to ensure that the food we produce and consume is safe, healthy, and of the highest quality.", "Hong Kong has reported a significant surge in air cargo handled in the month of August, marking a 6.7 percent increase over the same period last year, according to official data released by the Airport Authority. The unexpected spike in air freight volume has come as a relief to the aviation industry, which has been grappling with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption in international trade.\nThe data shows that the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) handled a total of 439,000 tonnes of air cargo in August, compared to 411,000 tonnes in the same month last year, indicating a remarkable jump of 6.7 percent. While imports increased by 11 percent, exports fell marginally by 0.5 percent, as reported by the official sources.\nThe positive growth has been attributed to the increase in demand for electronic products, medical goods, PPE, and temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals, which formed the bulk of the air shipments. In addition, the increasing adoption of e-commerce and logistics services has also contributed to the higher volumes of goods being transported by air.\nThe Hong Kong Airport Authority has welcomed the increase in air cargo handled as evidence of the resilience of the airport and its ability to adapt to the changing market dynamics. The Authority also believes that the positive growth could be sustained in the coming months, provided the industry experiences a gradual recovery in global demand for air cargo services.", "Russia is grappling with yet another devastating grain harvest for the second year in a row. The country is the world's largest wheat exporter, but its agricultural industry has been hit hard by poor weather conditions, including drought, heat waves, and wildfires.\nAccording to the Russian Agricultural Ministry, the country's grain harvest is expected to fall by 12% this year, to around 117 million tonnes. This is a significant drop from the record 135 million tonnes harvested in 2017.\nThe poor harvest is expected to hit Russia's economy hard, as agriculture is an important sector for the country. The agricultural industry accounts for about 4% of Russia's GDP and employs around 10% of the population. The drop in the grain harvest is also expected to lead to a rise in food prices, which could hit consumers hard.\nTo help offset the drop in its own harvest, Russia is expected to increase its imports of wheat and other grains. The country has already become a major importer of wheat, with around 7 million tonnes expected to be brought in this year. This will be a significant increase from last year when Russia only imported around 2 million tonnes of wheat.\nAnalysts predict that Russia's wheat imports could continue to grow in the coming years. The country has been hit by increasingly frequent and severe weather events, which have made it more difficult for farmers to grow crops. Poor infrastructure, including limited irrigation systems and a lack of storage facilities, has also contributed to the country's agricultural issues.\nThe government has pledged to invest more in agriculture, but it is unclear how much of an impact this will have. Russia has a history of supporting its agricultural industry, but many critics argue that the government's policies are outdated and do not reflect the realities of modern farming.\nThe poor grain harvest is also expected to have wider implications for the global agricultural industry. Russia's exports have helped to keep global wheat prices low in recent years, but the drop in production could lead to increased prices for consumers around the world. This could be particularly hard on countries that rely heavily on wheat imports, such as Egypt and Iraq.\nOverall, Russia's second consecutive bad grain harvest is a worrying sign for the country's economy and its agricultural industry. Increased imports may help to offset some of the damage, but there are concerns that the country's infrastructure and policies may not be able to keep pace with the changing climate and growing demand for food.", "In the third quarter of 1996, Ameritech and Sprint reported double-digit profit increases, marking a significant achievement for both companies during what was a tumultuous year for the telecommunications industry.\nWith Ameritech announcing a 13 percent increase in earnings and Sprint boasting an impressive 20 percent spike in profits, investors and analysts alike were quick to take notice of their strong performance.\nAccording to company officials, much of this growth can be attributed to the companies' ability to adapt to the changing marketplace and create innovative solutions for their customers.\n\"Ameritech recognized early on that the telecommunications industry was changing rapidly, and we knew that we needed to be proactive to stay ahead of the game,\" said Ameritech CEO Richard Notebaert. \"By investing in technology, improving our customer service, and expanding our offerings, we've been able to deliver value to our customers and drive growth for our company.\"\nSimilarly, Sprint reported that by investing heavily in its wireless division and rolling out new services like Internet access and long-distance calling, it was able to draw in new customers and strengthen its brand awareness.\n\"We're constantly striving to push the envelope and deliver new solutions to our customers, whether that's through more reliable connectivity, faster speeds, or innovative new services like unified messaging,\" said Sprint CEO William Esrey. \"We're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished and optimistic about what the future holds for our company.\"\nThe strong earnings reports from Ameritech and Sprint came at a time when many other telecommunications companies were struggling to maintain their footing in a rapidly changing industry. The mid-1990s saw the rise of the Internet and the proliferation of mobile devices, which created both new opportunities and new challenges for traditional telecommunications firms.\nHowever, with their strong financial performance in the third quarter of 1996, Ameritech and Sprint showed that it was possible to thrive in this new landscape by staying nimble, adapting to changing conditions, and focusing on delivering value to customers.\nOf course, this growth did not come without its challenges. Both companies faced stiff competition from other players in the telecommunications space, as well as regulatory hurdles and changing market conditions.\nHowever, through prudent financial management, strategic investments, and a relentless focus on customer satisfaction, Ameritech and Sprint were able to overcome these obstacles and position themselves strongly for future growth.\nLooking ahead, both companies are optimistic about their prospects for continued success. With ongoing investments in new technology, customer service, and marketing, they are well-positioned to capitalize on the changing telecommunications landscape and deliver value to their shareholders and customers alike.\nAs the industry continues to evolve, it seems likely that Ameritech and Sprint will remain key players in the telecommunications landscape, driving innovation and pushing the envelope in terms of what is possible. It will be exciting to watch as these companies continue to grow and adapt to the ever-changing needs of their customers and the market as a whole.", "Japanese banks are set to introduce new accounting methods for derivatives trading in a bid to improve transparency and reduce risk. The move comes in response to the recent collapse of Archegos Capital, which highlighted serious flaws in the risk management systems of several international banks.\nThe new accounting methods will require banks to value their derivatives portfolios on a mark-to-market basis, which means they will be priced based on their fair value at the end of each trading day. This is in contrast to the current method of valuing derivatives on a mark-to-model basis, which relies on mathematical models and can result in significant discrepancies between the stated value and the actual market value of the derivative.\nThe mark-to-market method is considered to be more accurate and reliable, as it captures changes in market conditions and reflects the actual performance of the derivatives portfolio. It also allows for greater transparency, as the fair value of each derivative will be readily available to regulators, investors, and other stakeholders.\nThe new accounting rules will apply to all types of derivatives, including swaps, futures, options, and other complex financial instruments. They will be gradually introduced over the next few years, with larger banks expected to adopt the new method first.\nThe move has been welcomed by financial experts and investors, who have long criticized the existing accounting rules for derivatives as opaque and prone to manipulation. The collapse of Archegos, which occurred in March 2021 and caused billions of dollars in losses for several international banks, has highlighted the urgent need for more robust risk management systems in the derivatives market.\nThe new accounting rules will also align Japanese banks with international accounting standards, which require the use of mark-to-market accounting for derivatives. This will make it easier for Japanese banks to do business with international financial institutions and investors, who are more familiar with mark-to-market valuation than mark-to-model.\nHowever, some industry observers have raised concerns that the new accounting rules could result in increased volatility and instability in the derivatives market. This is because mark-to-market accounting can lead to sudden swings in the value of derivatives portfolios in response to changes in market conditions.\nTo mitigate these risks, Japanese regulators are expected to introduce new capital requirements and risk management guidelines for banks that trade in derivatives. This will ensure that the banks have sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses in the event of a sudden market downturn, and that they have adequate risk management systems in place to monitor and control their derivatives activities.\nOverall, the introduction of new accounting methods for derivatives trading represents a significant step forward for Japanese banks and the global financial system as a whole. By increasing transparency and reducing risk, the new rules will help to restore investor confidence in the derivatives market and prevent future collapses like that of Archegos.", "Invesco Ltd. has announced its plans to acquire AIM Management in a deal worth $1.6 billion. The merger will create one of the world's largest investment management companies with $1.2 trillion in assets under management.\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approval. Following the completion of the merger, the new company will operate under the Invesco name and be based in Atlanta.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, Invesco CEO, Martin Flanagan said, \"We believe this combination will create a best-in-class investment management firm that will be well-positioned to serve clients globally.\" He added, \"This deal aligns with our strategy to enhance our investment capabilities, meet evolving client needs, and create significant value for our shareholders.\"\nAIM Management, based in Houston, is an investment management firm with a focus on delivering innovative and customized investment solutions to its clients. The company manages assets across a range of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, and real estate.\nInvesco, on the other hand, is a global investment management firm with a focus on active management. The company offers a range of investment solutions across equities, fixed income, and alternative strategies. Invesco has a presence in more than 25 countries, with offices in Atlanta, New York, London, and Hong Kong, among others.\nThe merger is expected to bring significant benefits to both companies. Invesco will gain access to AIM Management's expertise in private markets, including real estate and private equity. This will enable the company to expand its alternatives offering, which has become increasingly popular with investors.\nAIM Management, on the other hand, will benefit from Invesco's presence in key markets around the world. The merger will enable AIM Management to expand its global distribution capabilities and access new clients in regions such as Europe and Asia.\nThe deal comes at a time when the investment management industry is going through a period of rapid change. Investors are increasingly turning to cheaper, passive investment solutions such as exchange-traded funds, putting pressure on active investment managers like Invesco and AIM Management to deliver returns that justify their higher fees.\nThe merger will create a larger, more diversified investment management company that is better positioned to navigate these changes and deliver value to investors. The new company will have a broader range of investment capabilities, enabling it to offer customized solutions that meet the evolving needs of its clients.\nIn a joint statement, the CEOs of Invesco and AIM Management, Martin Flanagan and Lisa O'Connor, said, \"We believe this merger will create a company uniquely positioned to provide clients with the investment solutions they need to succeed in today's changing market environment.\"\nThe announcement of the merger has been welcomed by investors and analysts, who see it as a positive move for both companies. Shares of Invesco rose by 5% following the announcement, while shares of AIM Management were up by 6%.\nThe merger is the latest in a series of deals in the investment management industry. In March, Franklin Templeton completed its acquisition of rival investment manager Legg Mason in a deal worth $4.5 billion. In January, Morgan Stanley completed its acquisition of E*TRADE Financial in a deal worth $13 billion.\nThe Invesco-AIM Management merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approval. The new company will have a presence in more than 25 countries and manage assets of $1.2 trillion, making it one of the largest investment management firms in the world.", "Scottish Amicable, the 170-year-old mutual life insurer, is set to abandon its mutual status and embark on flotation to enhance its financial stability and growth prospects. The company announced that it is preparing to offer policyholders a special bonus and future benefits as part of the process.\nThe historic insurer, which had been operating under the mutual model since its establishment in 1826, said that the move would enable it to raise more capital, compete better, and offer a wider range of products and services. The company's board had unanimously approved the demutualization plans, subject to regulatory and policyholder approvals.\nThe insurer aims to raise up to \u00a3500m from the initial public offering (IPO) expected to take place later this year. The proceeds would be used to boost the firm's financial strength, support its growth ambitions, and enhance policyholders' value. The company added that it would also seek to establish a new charity reflected in its branding.\nUnder the demutualization plan, eligible policyholders would receive a special bonus, calculated as a proportion of their policy value. The payout would range from \u00a3500 to \u00a35,000, depending on policy size, type, and longevity. Additionally, Scottish Amicable said that policyholders would become shareholders in the new public company, allowing them to participate in its future success and growth. The company also pledged to offer future benefits, including a policyholder loyalty scheme and a range of discounted products and services.\nThe insurer emphasized that the move would not affect the security or coverage of its existing policies, which would continue to be provided under the same terms and conditions. The policies would also be protected by a new policyholder committee, which would represent the interests of policyholders and ensure that they have a say in the company's governance.\nCommenting on the announcement, Scottish Amicable CEO, John Williamson, said: \"This is an exciting and transformational move for our company, which will enable us to continue to meet our policyholders' needs, compete more effectively, and provide enhanced value and benefits. We are committed to ensuring that our policyholders are at the heart of the process and that they receive fair treatment, adequate compensation, and a say in our future direction.\"\nThe move by Scottish Amicable follows a trend among UK mutual insurers that have converted to the PLC (public limited company) structure in recent years, including Standard Life, NFU Mutual, and Royal London. The shift has been driven by increased regulatory scrutiny, tougher capital requirements, and pressure to remain competitive in a changing market environment.\nIn conclusion, Scottish Amicable's decision to demutualize and seek flotation represents a significant milestone in its history and a major strategic shift for the company. The move is expected to offer policyholders a unique opportunity to benefit from the firm's future growth and value, while enabling Scottish Amicable to enhance its financial strength and competitive position. The company aims to complete the demutualization process by the end of the year, subject to approval and market conditions.", "In a major move in the Australian banking sector, St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia have agreed to merge, creating the fifth largest bank in the country. The merger, which is set to be completed by the end of the year, will see the two banks combine their resources and operations to create a stronger and more competitive player in the market.\nThe deal, valued at A$2.65 billion, was announced by both banks in a joint statement released on Tuesday. Under the terms of the agreement, St George Bank will acquire all of the shares in Advance Bank Australia, which is currently a subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\nThe merged entity will have a total asset base of around A$190 billion and be able to offer a wider range of products and services to customers across the country. The new bank will also have a stronger presence in key markets, including New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.\nSt George Bank is currently the sixth largest bank in Australia, with a focus on retail banking and business lending. It has a strong presence in New South Wales and Queensland, and is known for its innovative customer service and technology-driven approach.\nAdvance Bank Australia, on the other hand, is a smaller regional bank that has been operating in the country since 1985. It has a focus on home loans and personal banking, and has a presence in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory.\nCommenting on the merger, St George Bank CEO Ross Miller said that it was an exciting opportunity for both banks to join forces and build a more competitive and customer-centric organisation. \"We believe that this merger will deliver significant value to our shareholders, customers and employees, by creating a stronger, more diversified and sustainable business,\" he said.\nAdvance Bank Australia CEO Bruce Munro also expressed his enthusiasm for the merger, saying that it would enable the bank to expand its reach and improve its products and services. \"We are delighted to be joining forces with St George Bank, which has a reputation for excellence and innovation in the banking sector,\" he said.\nThe announcement of the merger has been welcomed by many in the industry, who see it as a positive move for the Australian banking sector. \"This is a major deal that will create a stronger and more competitive player in the market,\" said John Alexander, CEO of the Australian Bankers' Association.\n\"It is a positive development for customers and the broader community, as it will bring together the expertise and resources of two highly respected banks to create a stronger and more diversified financial institution,\" he added.\nThe merger is also expected to have a positive impact on the Australian economy, by creating more jobs and boosting investment. \"We believe that this merger will help to drive economic growth and prosperity in Australia, by creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals,\" said Miller.\nHowever, there are concerns that the merger could lead to job losses and reduced competition in the banking sector. \"We need to ensure that the merger does not result in any negative impact on employees, customers or competition,\" said Labor MP Jim Chalmers.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has said that it will review the merger to ensure that it complies with competition laws and does not have any negative impact on consumers. \"We will examine the merger closely, and if we have any concerns about its impact on competition, we may seek further information or impose conditions on the merger,\" said ACCC Vice Chair Delia Rickard.\nOverall, the merger between St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia represents a significant development in the Australian banking sector, and is likely to have a big impact on the industry in the months and years to come. By creating a stronger and more competitive player in the market, the merged entity will be well positioned to meet the needs of customers and drive economic growth in the country.", "Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, has announced a successful debt restructuring plan, securing its financial future until 2003.\nThe company has struggled with the burden of a massive debt since the construction of the tunnel in the 1990s. With mounting losses and declining revenues, the firm had been on the brink of collapse for years. However, after several months of negotiations with creditors, Eurotunnel has finally reached a deal to restructure its debt.\nUnder the agreement, the company's debt of \u20ac9.0 billion ($10.6 billion) will be reduced by \u20ac4.2 billion ($4.9 billion), with the remaining debt extended until 2003. The plan will also see the company receive a cash injection of \u20ac2.9 billion ($3.4 billion) from its creditors, which will allow Eurotunnel to invest in modernizing its infrastructure, including upgrading the trains that transport passengers and goods through the tunnel.\nJacques Gounon, Eurotunnel's Chairman and CEO, hailed the restructuring plan as a \"durable and robust solution\" that would ensure the company's long-term viability. He thanked the company's creditors, including banks and bondholders, for their willingness to support the plan.\n\"This agreement is an important milestone for Eurotunnel, and we are extremely pleased to have reached a final outcome that secures the future of our company,\" said Gounon. \"With this restructuring plan, we are now better positioned to invest in our infrastructure and services and to continue to meet the needs of our customers.\"\nThe restructuring plan has been welcomed by industry experts, who see it as a positive step forward for Eurotunnel. Some analysts had previously predicted that the company was headed for bankruptcy, given its mounting debt and declining revenues.\n\"The restructuring plan is a significant achievement for Eurotunnel, and it represents a real milestone in the company's history,\" said Mark O'Neil, CEO of Crossrail, a key Eurotunnel customer. \"It is great news for all those who rely on the tunnel for the efficient and reliable transportation of goods and people between the UK and Europe.\"\nEurotunnel's financial woes have been compounded in recent years by the impact of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. The company has reported a significant drop in traffic through the tunnel, with many passengers and freight operators opting for alternative routes. However, with this new debt restructuring plan, Eurotunnel is now better placed to weather the ongoing economic uncertainties.\nThe restructuring plan is subject to approval by Eurotunnel's shareholders and the French courts, but the company is confident that it will be completed by the end of this year. With a more secure financial footing, Eurotunnel is now looking ahead to a brighter future, with plans to invest in new technologies and services that will benefit its customers and stakeholders.", "NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of the UK-based NatWest Group, has announced it is acquiring Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in their joint venture, with the transaction expected to be completed later this year. The acquisition will see NatWest Markets become the sole owner of the joint venture and marks a significant step in the bank's ambitions to expand its global presence in the financial markets.\nThe joint venture, which was formed in 2016, has been focused on providing financial and capital markets services in the Asia Pacific region. The partnership allowed both companies to leverage their respective strengths and expertise, with NatWest Markets bringing its experience in financial markets and Wheelock & Company Ltd providing its extensive network and regional knowledge.\nHowever, the decision to acquire Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture was driven by NatWest Markets' strategic objectives and the opportunity to expand its business into the growing Asia Pacific region. The move aligns with the bank's goal of building a stronger, more diversified and sustainable business by investing in areas of growth and opportunity.\nAccording to a statement by NatWest Markets, the acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture will provide it with greater control over its business in the Asia Pacific region and enable it to invest further in the capabilities and resources needed to service its clients in the region. The acquisition, therefore, is expected to deliver significant growth to the bank and its clients as it enhances its ability to offer a wider range of financial products and services.\nThe acquisition will also enable NatWest Markets to strengthen its commitment to sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles. As part of the deal, NatWest Markets has committed to continuing to implement ESG policies and practices in the region, in line with its global sustainability strategy. It will also align with Wheelock & Company Ltd's strong ESG ethos, with the company being a well-respected leader in sustainability in the Asia Pacific region.\nThe acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of this year. The completion of the transaction will mark a significant milestone for NatWest Markets as it continues to execute its strategic plans and priorities. It also reinforces its commitment to expanding and strengthening its presence in key growth markets around the world.\nIn a statement, Johan Sehlin, Head of Asia Pacific at NatWest Markets, said: \"This acquisition is an important step in our journey to build a stronger, more diverse and sustainable business. We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and remain committed to delivering the best service and solutions to our clients in the region.\"\nThe acquisition of Wheelock & Company Ltd's stake in the joint venture will undoubtedly be a transformative moment for NatWest Markets as it seeks to build a stronger and more diversified business that can deliver for its clients in some of the world's fastest-growing and most dynamic markets. Its commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices will also ensure that it remains a leader in this field and is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for ESG-focused financial products and services.", "China\u2019s government has launched a campaign to clean up futures exchanges as part of its efforts to reduce fraud, misconduct and illegal activities that have been plaguing the country\u2019s financial system in recent years. The move is aimed at restoring investors\u2019 confidence in the market and preventing any systemic risks that may arise from the unregulated and poorly-monitored futures market.\nAccording to reports, the campaign is being led by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which has set a target of cleaning up all but four or five futures exchanges by the end of the year. The CSRC\u2019s efforts will involve strengthening rules and regulations to ensure that all trading activities are transparent and above board.\nThis is not the first time that China has launched a crackdown on the futures market. In 2015, the country\u2019s government suspended trading on several futures exchanges following a massive stock market crash. The suspension was lifted in 2016 after the government introduced new rules and regulations to curb speculation and reduce leverage.\nHowever, despite these efforts, the futures market has continued to be plagued by fraud and other illegal activities. This has led to a decline in investor confidence, with many retail investors choosing to stay away from the market altogether.\nAs part of the current crackdown, the CSRC has already identified several areas that need to be addressed, including strengthening risk management, improving surveillance and monitoring systems, and enhancing information disclosure requirements. The regulator has also said that it will be conducting inspections of futures exchanges to check for compliance with regulations.\nThe initiative has been welcomed by investors and market participants, who are hopeful that it will help to restore trust in the market. However, some experts have warned that the crackdown could have unintended consequences, such as driving investors towards more unregulated or offshore markets.\nDespite these concerns, it is clear that the Chinese government is committed to cleaning up the futures market and putting an end to illegal activities. With only a few exchanges remaining as its target, it is hoped that the crackdown will be successful in restoring investor confidence and reducing systemic risks in China\u2019s financial system.", "China Claims Taiwan Is a Pawn of Western Forces, Trying to Divide and Weaken the Country\nChina has made new claims that Taiwan is a pawn of the Western forces that are trying to divide and weaken the country. This comes after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen stated her commitment to democracy and national sovereignty, which Beijing sees as a threat to its own territorial claims.\nIn a statement released by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, spokesperson Zhao Lijian accused Taiwan of being a \"pawn of Western anti-China forces,\" claiming that they are using Taiwan to \"contain China and seek their own interests.\"\nZhao also warned Taiwan that \"any attempt to seek independence means war,\" which is a significant increase in the rhetoric from China. The statement was made after Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen made a speech on Sunday, in which she vowed to defend democracy and protect Taiwan's sovereignty.\nIn her speech, Tsai criticized Beijing's growing aggression towards Taiwan, saying that China's military threat to the island has reached \"an unprecedented level.\" She also spoke about how Taiwan is a \"model student of democracy\" and that the country has done everything it can to maintain peace and stability in the region.\nChina has long considered Taiwan to be a breakaway province, and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. However, Taiwan has its own government, military, and constitution, and has maintained its independence since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.\nChina's statement follows a growing trend of aggressive rhetoric towards Taiwan, with Chinese officials frequently warning of military action and conducting military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. China has also been using economic pressure to try and isolate Taiwan, with many countries being pressured to cut diplomatic ties with the island.\nTaiwan has been actively seeking to strengthen its ties with other countries and to maintain its influence in the international community. However, this has caused tension with China, which sees Taiwan's efforts as an attempt to gain independence and shatter its territorial integrity.\nThe United States, which has long been Taiwan's biggest ally, has been supportive of the island's efforts to maintain its independence. This has also caused friction with China, which sees the United States as interfering in Chinese affairs.\nThe growing tension between China and Taiwan is set to continue, with no sign of either side backing down or seeking a compromise. However, the international community is watching closely, with many hoping that a peaceful resolution can be reached before the situation escalates any further.\nIn summary, China's recent claims that Taiwan is a pawn of Western forces is a clear indication of the growing tension between the two countries. With both sides unwilling to compromise, the situation is likely to escalate further, potentially leading to serious consequences for the region and beyond. The international community will need to step in if a peaceful resolution is to be found.", "In a move that has sent shockwaves across the world, a Chinese dissident has reportedly fled to Hong Kong, citing concerns about human rights and Beijing's growing influence over the territory. The dissident, whose name has not been disclosed for security reasons, is believed to have left mainland China in the last few days and is currently seeking asylum in Hong Kong.\nThe news comes amid increasing fears over China's crackdown on dissent and shrinking civil liberties, particularly in Hong Kong. The semi-autonomous territory has been rocked by mass anti-government protests in recent years, with Beijing imposing a controversial national security law last year that critics say has further eroded the freedoms and rights of Hong Kong residents.\nThe unnamed dissident's reported flight to Hong Kong is seen as a major blow to Beijing's efforts to suppress dissent and opposition. It also highlights the challenges facing activists and free speech advocates in China, with many forced to flee the country or face persecution.\nThe news has been met with concern by human rights groups and civil society organizations, who are calling for Hong Kong authorities to grant the dissident asylum and ensure their safety.\n\"China's increasing crackdown on dissent is a major threat to human rights and free speech around the world,\" said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's regional director for East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \"The reported flight of this dissident to Hong Kong should serve as a wake-up call to governments around the world to take action to protect the rights and freedoms of activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens in China.\"\nHong Kong's Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, has yet to comment on the case. However, the city's government has been criticized in the past for failing to protect the rights of asylum seekers and refugees, particularly those fleeing persecution in mainland China.\nThe news also highlights the broader geopolitical tensions between China and the West, with relations between the two sides deteriorating in recent years over issues ranging from trade and intellectual property theft to human rights abuses. The United States, in particular, has been vocal in its criticism of China's actions in Hong Kong, with President Joe Biden issuing a statement last month calling on Beijing to respect the territory's autonomy and protect the rights of its people.\nIn recent years, China has become increasingly assertive on the global stage, seeking to expand its influence and assert its power in regions such as Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Its Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project spanning dozens of countries, has been touted as a key way for China to exert its influence and expand its economic and political footprint around the world.\nHowever, Beijing's growing assertiveness has also sparked fears about the impact on human rights and civil liberties, with many countries and organizations calling for greater scrutiny of China's actions and policies.\n\"The case of this dissident is just one example of the challenges facing those who speak out against China's repression and authoritarianism,\" said Bequelin. \"We must stand together and fight for the rights and freedoms of all people, regardless of their nationality or political beliefs.\"\nThe reported flight of the Chinese dissident to Hong Kong is just the latest example of the challenges facing activists and free speech advocates in China and around the world. As tensions continue to rise between China and the West, it is clear that the fight for human rights and democracy will only become more pressing \u2013 and more important \u2013 in the years to come.", "London-based investment firm, Olympic Financial Ltd, has announced its plans to sell the company by October of this year. The decision comes as the company looks to transition to a new phase of growth, having weathered a challenging period in the financial markets.\nFounded in 2008, Olympic Financial has established itself as a trusted name in investment and wealth management, catering to high net worth individuals and institutional clients. The firm's portfolio includes a diverse range of assets, including equities, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments.\nWith a strong track record of delivering consistent returns and a reputation for ethical and transparent practices, the company has attracted interest from several potential buyers, both domestic and overseas. The sale is expected to value the firm at over $200 million, according to sources close to the deal.\nIn a statement released to the press, Olympic Financial's CEO, John Smith, said, \"We are pleased to announce that we have initiated the process of selling Olympic Financial Ltd. Our decision to sell the company reflects our commitment to the long-term success of the firm and our desire to provide our clients with access to the best resources and expertise in the industry.\"\nSmith added that the company's leadership team would remain in place through the transition period to ensure a smooth handover to the new owners. \"Our focus remains on delivering value to our clients, and we are confident that the new owners will share our vision and continue to build on the strong legacy of excellence that Olympic Financial has established over the years,\" he said.\nThe sale of Olympic Financial is expected to generate significant interest from potential buyers, given the firm's strong performance record and reputation in the market. Several industry analysts believe that the sale will mark a turning point for the company, opening up new opportunities for growth and expansion.\nHowever, some industry experts caution that the sale of Olympic Financial could pose a risk to the company's stability and reputation if it falls into the wrong hands. They stress the importance of ensuring that the buyer shares the same values and principles as Olympic Financial, and that the transition process is managed carefully to avoid disruption to clients.\nNonetheless, the sale of Olympic Financial represents a significant milestone for the company and the broader investment industry. It marks a new chapter in the firm's journey and creates fresh opportunities for it to continue its growth trajectory in the years to come. The sale is expected to be finalized by October, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.", "The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could potentially have a major impact on the trillion-dollar futures markets. The case involves a dispute over the interpretation of a key provision in the Commodity Exchange Act, which regulates futures trading.\nThe provision in question is known as the \"anti-manipulation provision,\" which prohibits traders from intentionally manipulating market prices. The case centers on whether this provision applies only to manipulative practices that directly affect futures prices or whether it also applies to practices that may indirectly affect prices, such as the manipulation of underlying commodities.\nThe case has attracted the attention of many in the financial world, as the futures markets are a crucial component of the global economy. Futures trading allows businesses to hedge their risks and investors to speculate on future price movements, but it is also a complex and highly regulated sector.\nIf the Supreme Court were to rule that the anti-manipulation provision only applies to direct manipulation of futures prices, it could potentially open the door for traders to engage in more indirect forms of manipulation. This could destabilize the market and erode confidence in the futures sector, which could have ripple effects throughout the economy.\nHowever, some experts believe that Congress may step in to address the issue. There are currently two bills in the works that would clarify the anti-manipulation provision and ensure that it applies to all forms of manipulation, both direct and indirect.\nThe first bill, known as the Futures Market Protection Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas. The bill would explicitly state that the anti-manipulation provision applies to the manipulation of both futures prices and underlying commodities.\nThe second bill, known as the Capital Markets Fraud Prosecution Act and introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, would also address the issue of indirect manipulation. The bill calls for a broader definition of manipulation and increased penalties for those who engage in manipulative practices.\nBoth bills have garnered support from industry groups and advocates for market integrity. They argue that a clear and consistent interpretation of the anti-manipulation provision is crucial for maintaining trust and stability in the futures markets.\nThe Supreme Court case, which is expected to be heard in the coming months, will be closely watched by all sides. If the court rules in favor of a narrow interpretation of the anti-manipulation provision, it could increase pressure on Congress to act.\nHowever, some experts caution that any legislative solution will need to strike a delicate balance between protecting against manipulation and not stifling legitimate innovation and trading practices.\n\"The key to any legislation in this area is that it targets intentional manipulation and not legitimate trading practices,\" said Jared Levy, a former CBOE options trader and current CEO of the investment advisory firm ProfitableTrading.com. \"It's a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach.\"\nRegardless of the outcome of the Supreme Court case or any potential legislative action, it is clear that the issue of market manipulation and integrity will remain a critical topic in the futures industry for years to come.\nAs the global economy becomes more interconnected and reliant on complex financial instruments, ensuring the integrity of these markets will only become more important. The Supreme Court case and the proposed legislation may represent just the beginning of a larger conversation about how to achieve this goal.", "Scott McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems, recently made an interesting observation at a technology conference. According to him, the creation of the internet has sparked the biggest creative explosion in computer history. McNealy, who was the CEO of Sun Microsystems from 1984 to 2006, added that this explosion wouldn't have been possible without the internet as it is the backbone of the modern digital world.\nThe rise of the internet has brought us many new technologies and innovations. We now have social media, e-commerce, instant messaging, online streaming, and much more. These services have transformed the way we interact with each other and conduct business. It is hard to imagine a world without the internet today.\nThe internet has also provided us with an unmatched amount of information. We can access any data on any subject with just a few clicks. This has made learning and research much easier and has enhanced our knowledge about the world around us. The ability to share knowledge and information on a global scale has led to the creation of many new technologies that have improved people's lives.\nOne area where the internet has made a significant impact is the entertainment industry. Online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have disrupted the traditional TV and movie business. These services offer a vast library of content that can be accessed at any time and from anywhere in the world. This has given rise to new content creators and online stars who have gained a massive following on social media.\nThe internet has also made communication much more accessible and affordable. With video conferencing software such as Skype and Zoom, people can easily connect and work remotely. This has helped businesses to save on travel costs and has made remote work a viable option for many industries.\nAnother area where the internet has made a difference is e-commerce. Online shopping has made it easier for people to buy anything they need without leaving their homes. This has led to the creation of new online marketplaces such as Amazon and Alibaba, which have revolutionized the way goods are bought and sold. E-commerce has also helped small businesses to gain access to customers worldwide without having to invest heavily in physical stores.\nThe internet has also enabled a faster and more efficient way of conducting financial transactions. With online banking and payment services such as PayPal and Stripe, people can send and receive money instantly from anywhere in the world. This has made it easier for businesses to conduct transactions globally and has made international trade simpler.\nHowever, the internet has also brought with it new challenges. Online privacy and security are major concerns, as hackers and cybercriminals are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities. Cyberbullying and online harassment have also become significant issues that need to be addressed.\nIn conclusion, the internet has undoubtedly been a game-changer in the world of technology. It has sparked a creative explosion that has transformed the way we live, work and communicate. The internet has made the world a smaller place and has brought people together like never before. While there are challenges that come with it, the benefits outweigh them. The internet has undoubtedly been the biggest creative explosion in computer history, and it will continue to shape our lives for years to come.", "Tibet, the mystical land known for its mountainous terrain, serene lakes and vibrant culture has seen a surge in tourist inflow over the years. With its unique combination of culture, spiritualism and natural splendor, Tibet has become a magnet for tourists across the world.\nThe tourism industry in Tibet has been booming, with the sector contributing over 14% to the region's GDP. The tourism industry has been a key driver of employment and economic growth in the region. The region has seen the number of tourists grow from around 3 million in 2005 to over 30 million in 2019.\nThe influx of tourists has led to the development of tourism infrastructure in the region. Improved transport facilities, better accommodation options and a growing number of restaurants and cafes have resulted in increased comfort for tourists.\nHowever, one issue that has remained unsolved in the tourism industry in Tibet is the lack of proper sanitation facilities. In many parts of Tibet, public toilets are very stinky and are not well-maintained. This has been a major challenge in the tourism sector, affecting the overall tourist experience.\nDespite this, the stunning beauty of Tibet continues to win the hearts of tourists from all over the world. The picturesque landscape, with the dominating mountains, expansive grasslands and crystal-clear lakes, is nothing less than breathtaking. The region is also home to some of the most iconic landmarks, such as the Potala Palace and Mount Everest, which draw tourists from far and wide.\nThe region's unique cultural heritage has also been a key draw for tourists. Tibet is known for its diverse cultural practices, and traditions such as Buddhism, which have been passed down for centuries. Tourists visit the region to experience these cultural practices first-hand, which gives them a true taste of Tibet's rich cultural diversity.\nAnother factor that has contributed to the growth of tourism in Tibet is the region's unique topography. The landscape is perfect for adventure and outdoor activities such as trekking, mountaineering, and rafting. The region's topography makes it an ideal destination for adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers.\nThe rise in the number of tourists has led to the growth of the hospitality industry, which has been instrumental in employing a significant number of Tibetans. In fact, the tourism industry is seen as a crucial source of livelihood for people in Tibet. The industry has provided a much-needed economic boost to the region, which was largely dependent on agriculture and pastoralism.\nHowever, despite the tourism industry's success, the issue of proper sanitation remains a significant challenge. While efforts have been made to improve the overall infrastructure in the region, public toilets remain an area of concern. Public toilets are often crowded, unhygienic and lack basic amenities such as toilet paper and soap.\nGiven the importance of the tourism industry in the region, the authorities have been making efforts to address the issue of public sanitation. The authorities have been collaborating with local communities to improve the hygiene and cleanliness of public toilets. These efforts include the construction of new toilets, modernization of existing ones and a focus on maintenance and cleanliness.\nIn addition to these efforts, the authorities have been encouraging tourists to cooperate in maintaining the cleanliness of public toilets and other public places. To this end, the authorities have put up signs and posters encouraging tourists to use toilets responsibly and to maintain cleanliness.\nDespite these efforts, there is still a long way to go in improving the hygiene and sanitation facilities in the region. The authorities need to step up their efforts to ensure that public toilets are clean, functional and have all the basic amenities. This will go a long way in enhancing the overall tourist experience and also contribute to the growth of the tourism industry.\nIt is necessary to note that improving sanitation facilities in Tibet is not just a matter of enhancing the tourist experience. It is also crucial for the overall health and wellbeing of the local population. Lack of proper sanitation can lead to a variety of health issues, and hence, the authorities need to prioritize the issue of public sanitation.\nIn conclusion, Tibet's breathtaking beauty and booming tourism industry have been overshadowing the issue of stinky public toilets. As the tourism industry continues to grow, it is essential to prioritize the issue of public sanitation to ensure that the local population benefits from the industry's growth, and the overall tourist experience is enhanced. The authorities have a crucial role to play in addressing this issue, and they need to take urgent steps to ensure that public toilets are well-maintained, clean, and hygienic. By doing so, the tourism industry in Tibet can continue to grow in a sustainable and responsible manner.", "United Airlines, one of the largest airlines in the world, announced today that it has placed orders totaling $4.4 billion for new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus to update its fleet. The airline has been looking to modernize its passenger jets in order to offer more efficient aircraft that are also more environmentally friendly.\nThe order includes 25 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes and 25 Airbus A321neo planes, which will be delivered over the coming years.

United Airlines is one of the first major airlines in the world to restart the use of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.\nAirbus also expressed its pleasure over the lucrative business deal with United Airlines. The company sees it as a testament to the quality of its A321neo aircraft with its excellent fuel efficiency and an ability to carry an increasing number of passengers and cargo. Airbus and Boeing are two of the world's largest aerospace companies, both competing to gain an advantage over the other.\nIn conclusion, the acquisition of new planes by United Airlines comes as the airline industry is slowly recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and United Airlines acknowledges the importance of operating with modern, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly aircraft. The move is a wise and forward-thinking one as it will help the airline gain a competitive edge in the industry.", "Microsoft has announced the release of new software technologies that are aimed at improving information sharing through computer networks. The announcement was made at the Microsoft Ignite conference, which was held virtually this year.\nThe new technologies include updates to Microsoft Teams, the company's popular collaboration platform that allows teams to work together on projects and share information. The updates will enable users to share more types of files, including PDFs, whiteboards, and activity logs. Additionally, Teams will now be able to handle larger meetings of up to 1,000 participants and up to 20,000 attendees in view-only mode.\nMicrosoft also unveiled Azure Communication Services, a suite of services that allows developers to add real-time communication features such as voice and video calls, chat, and SMS to their applications.

This will allow users to find information they need more quickly and easily, and will also help organizations to better manage their corporate knowledge.\nIn his keynote address at the conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the importance of technology in helping people and organizations work more efficiently in the face of current challenges. \"As we all adjust to this new reality of work, we need tools that can adapt and empower us to be as productive as possible,\" Nadella said. \"We're focused on creating solutions that help individuals and organizations thrive in this new world.\"", "Hong Kong fund managers have voiced their shock and condemnation over the recent revelations of front-running practices at Jardine Fleming Investment Management, one of the city's most respected and widely followed investment firms. The news has sent shockwaves throughout the financial community in Hong Kong and beyond, sparking concerns about the integrity of the industry and the safety of investors.\nFor those who may be unfamiliar with the term, front-running refers to the illegal practice of trading securities based on information obtained from a confidential source before that information is made public. This kind of activity is strictly prohibited by securities laws and regulations, as it gives an unfair advantage to those who possess the confidential information, at the expense of other investors.\nThe revelations about Jardine Fleming have come as a surprise to many, as the firm has a long history of ethical conduct and has been highly regarded within the industry for decades. According to reports, at least two former employees of the firm have been accused of engaging in front-running practices while working at Jardine Fleming, and the company itself is being investigated for alleged systemic failures related to compliance and risk management.\nThe news has been met with widespread shock and disappointment by fund managers and other financial professionals in Hong Kong, who say that it raises serious concerns about the state of ethics in the industry. Many are also worried that the incident could damage the reputation of Hong Kong as a leading financial center, putting its position as a hub for international investment at risk.\nSome have suggested that the incident may be indicative of wider problems within the industry, with concerns being raised about the adequacy of regulatory oversight and the effectiveness of compliance measures. Others have called for more stringent enforcement of securities laws, arguing that lax enforcement can create a culture of impunity which encourages unethical behavior.\nDespite the concerns expressed by industry professionals, many remain optimistic that the incident will ultimately serve as a wake-up call for the financial community in Hong Kong, prompting greater scrutiny and a renewed commitment to ethical conduct. Some have suggested that the incident may also lead to increased demands for transparency and accountability, which could ultimately strengthen investor protections and help to bolster Hong Kong's reputation as a safe and reliable place for investment.\nIn the meantime, however, the incident has dealt a significant blow to the trust and confidence of investors, who may now be more hesitant to put their money into Hong Kong-based investment vehicles. It also highlights the need for stronger regulation and better oversight across the industry, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. As one fund manager put it, \"The goal of the industry should be to serve the interests of investors, and any practices that undermine that goal should be met with swift and severe consequences.\"", "In recent years, China has made concerted efforts to develop its own capital markets, using domestic savings instead of relying on foreign investment opportunities. This move is seen as a way to reduce the country's reliance on external capital and protect its economy from external shocks.\nChina's domestic savings have been growing rapidly in recent years, boosted by a surge in household wealth and rising disposable incomes. According to the country's National Bureau of Statistics, total domestic savings reached 264.11 trillion yuan (about $40.6 trillion) in 2020, up 7.8 percent from the previous year. This vast amount of money presents a significant opportunity for China to develop its capital markets and attract more investment.\nThe Chinese government has been working to channel this domestic savings into the country's capital markets. In recent years, it has introduced a series of measures designed to encourage individuals and institutions to invest in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. These measures include tax incentives, reduced trading fees, and the launch of new investment products.\nAt the same time, China has been reducing its reliance on foreign investment in its capital markets. According to a report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the proportion of foreign ownership of Chinese domestic bonds has fallen from nearly 9 percent in 2019 to just over 4 percent in 2020. This reduction is seen as a deliberate move by the Chinese government to insulate its economy from external risks, such as financial crises or political tensions.\nChina's efforts to develop its own capital markets have been met with some challenges. One of the biggest obstacles has been a lack of transparency and regulatory oversight. Critics argue that China's financial system is still too opaque and not open enough to foreign investors, which could limit its attractiveness as an investment destination.\nDespite these challenges, many analysts believe that China's domestic savings represent a significant opportunity for the country to develop its own capital markets and reduce its reliance on external investment. They point to the country's large pool of domestic savings as a major advantage, as well as the government's commitment to developing its financial infrastructure.\nOne key area of focus for China's capital markets development is the bond market. According to a report by the Bank of America, China's bond market could become the world's largest within the next few years, overtaking the US market in size. This growth is driven by a combination of factors, including a growing demand for fixed-income securities, increased issuance of debt by Chinese companies, and a loosening of restrictions on foreign investment in the market.\nTo further develop its bond market, China has been introducing a range of new financial instruments and promoting greater transparency and disclosure among issuers. It has also been working to expand the market's investor base, including encouraging more foreign investment.\nChina's efforts to build its own capital markets are part of a broader drive to reduce its dependence on external investment and increase its self-sufficiency. It remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful in the long term, but many analysts believe that China's vast pool of domestic savings presents a significant opportunity for the country to build a robust and sustainable financial system that will help support its continued growth and development.", "Former British tennis star Tim Henman has proved that he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level as he became the only seed to progress to the semifinals of the Czech Indoor Open.\nThe 43-year-old, who reached six Grand Slam semifinals during his career, had to battle past tough opponents in his opening matches before cruising to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over home favorite Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals.\nHenman, who is widely regarded as one of the best serve-and-volley players of his generation, said he was pleased with his performance so far in the tournament.\n\"I've been working hard on my game and it's great to see things coming together here in the Czech Republic,\" he said after his quarterfinal win.\n\"I know that I'm not the player I used to be, but I still enjoy the challenge of competing against some of the best players in the world.\"\nHenman's success in Prague has been surprising given that he has not played competitively for some time and was only seeded ninth in the tournament.\nHis victory over Berdych, who is ranked 32nd in the world, was particularly impressive as the Czech had been in good form coming into the match.\nDespite his success, Henman is under no illusions about the difficulty of the task that lies ahead.\n\"I know that I'm going to be up against some tough opponents in the semifinals and beyond,\" he said.\n\"But I'm looking forward to the challenge and I'm just taking it one match at a time.\"\nOne player who will be hoping to stop Henman in his tracks is Frenchman Gael Monfils, who is seeded sixth in the tournament.\nMonfils, who reached the semifinals of the US Open in 2016, saw off the challenge of Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets in his quarterfinal match.\nThe other semifinal will be contested by two Czech players, Jiri Vesely and Lukas Rosol.\nVesely, who is ranked 107th in the world, pulled off one of the biggest shocks of the tournament so far when he defeated second-seeded Frenchman Lucas Pouille in the second round.\nRosol, meanwhile, has been in good form throughout the tournament, defeating fourth-seeded Argentine Diego Schwartzman in the quarterfinals.\nThe Czech Indoor Open, which is part of the ATP World Tour 250 series, has a prize fund of $524,340 and attracts some of the best players in the world.\nThe tournament has been held annually since 1994 and has been won by some of the biggest names in the sport, including Roger Federer, Ivan Lendl, and Pete Sampras.\nThe semifinals of this year's tournament will be held on Saturday, with the final taking place on Sunday.", "The UK government's Private Finance Initiative (PFI) has faced a crisis of confidence with major concerns being raised about the delays in awarding contracts. The delays have been blamed on bureaucratic red tape and a lack of transparency in the procurement process, leading to growing dissatisfaction among potential bidders.\nThe PFI was introduced in the UK over two decades ago as a way of delivering public infrastructure projects through private sector investment. The basic principles of the PFI involve the private sector financing, designing, building and operating public infrastructure projects, which are then leased back to the government over a long-term contract.\nThe approach has been used to deliver a wide range of projects, including but not limited to hospitals, schools, roads, and waste management facilities. Since its inception, the PFI has been a significant source of investment in the UK's public infrastructure, with over 700 projects worth approximately \u00a360 billion being delivered under PFI contracts.\nHowever, the PFI model has been subject to widespread criticism, with concerns being raised about the cost of financing the projects, the lack of transparency in the procurement process, and the long-term liabilities that are placed on the public sector. Despite these criticisms, the PFI model has been widely used by governments of both political persuasions.\nThe current crisis of confidence in the PFI has been brought about by a number of high-profile delays in the awarding of contracts. One of the most significant examples is the delays in awarding the contract for the re-development of HMP Wellingborough, a new category C prison in Northamptonshire.\nThe contract was first put out to tender in 2017, and a winner was expected to be announced in 2018. However, the announcement was delayed due to a legal challenge by one of the bidders, and the process had to be restarted in 2019.\nAs of now, the contract remains un-awarded, with no clear indication of when a decision will be made. This has led to criticism from organizations such as the National Audit Office, which has highlighted the cost to the taxpayer of delays in awarding contracts.\nAnother example of delays in awarding contracts under the PFI is the recent announcement that the procurement process for the construction of the new Prince Charles Eye Unit at King's Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire will be restarted. The decision was taken after a legal challenge was mounted by one of the bidders.\nWhile delays and legal challenges are not uncommon in the procurement process, the PFI model has been criticized for exacerbating these issues due to the long-term nature of the contracts involved. The length of the contracts means that bidders are often willing to invest significant time and money in pursuing a contract, knowing that if they are successful, the rewards will be great.\nHowever, the delay in awarding contracts can lead to significant additional costs for bidders, which are often passed on to the government if the contract is eventually awarded. This, in turn, can lead to increased costs for the taxpayer and delays in the delivery of infrastructure projects.\nThe crisis of confidence in the PFI has led to calls for increased transparency and greater accountability in the procurement process. One suggestion has been the creation of a central procurement organization that would oversee the procurement of PFI contracts, ensuring that the process is transparent and fair for all bidders.\nAnother proposal has been the development of a standard procurement process for PFI contracts, which would make it easier for bidders to understand the requirements and ensure that the process is fair and transparent.\nUltimately, the crisis of confidence in the PFI model highlights the need for greater scrutiny of the procurement process for public infrastructure projects. While the PFI has delivered significant investment in the UK's infrastructure, there is a clear need to ensure that the process is effective, efficient, and transparent. Failure to do so risks undermining public confidence in the delivery of these critical projects, with significant long-term consequences for the UK's infrastructure and its economy.", "Australian steelmaker BlueScope Steel has proposed forming alliances with partners in Asia to build huge steel mills with a capacity of up to 10 million metric tonnes of steel per year, according to a company statement released earlier today.\nThe announcement comes amid growing demand for steel in Asia, particularly in China and India where infrastructure development and urbanisation continue to increase at a fast pace. While BlueScope Steel is already well-established in Australia and the US, the company is looking to expand its footprint in the Asian region.\n\"We are excited to announce these ambitious plans to expand our operations in Asia,\" said BlueScope Steel CEO Mark Vassella. \"It is a great opportunity to work with local partners in the region to leverage our expertise in steel-making and create significant value for our customers and shareholders.\"\nThe proposed partnerships would involve sharing technology and expertise as well as financing and operating large-scale steel mills in countries such as China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand. BlueScope Steel has already identified potential partners in these countries and is in the process of negotiating agreements.\nThe company's plans have been welcomed by industry experts and analysts, who see it as a smart move to tap into the huge market potential in Asia.\n\"The demand for steel in the region is expected to grow by more than 5% annually over the next few years, driven by infrastructure development and urbanisation,\" said a spokesperson for the Asian Steel Association. \"BlueScope Steel's proposed alliances with local partners will help to meet this demand and ensure that the region has access to high-quality steel products.\"\nBlueScope Steel's move to expand in Asia comes at a time when the global steel industry is in a period of consolidation and restructuring. Overcapacity and slowing demand in some regions have led to mergers and acquisitions, as well as closures of outdated mills.\nHowever, BlueScope Steel appears to be taking a different approach by focusing on partnerships and technology-sharing to maintain its competitive edge in the industry.\n\"We believe that working with local partners is the best way to enter new markets and deliver value to our customers,\" said Vassella. \"By leveraging our expertise and technology, we can help to improve the efficiency and sustainability of steel production in Asia, while also creating jobs and supporting economic growth in the region.\"\nBlueScope Steel's proposed partnerships are expected to be finalised by the end of the year, with construction of the new steel mills to commence in 2022. The company is confident in its ability to deliver on these plans, which it sees as a major milestone in its expansion strategy.", "BT has strengthened its position as one of the world's top telecommunications providers with a $20 billion merger with MCI, the US-based technology company.\nThe deal, which was announced on Monday, is set to give BT access to the world's biggest telecoms market and increase its competitiveness against rivals, including Verizon and AT&T.\nAnalysts predict that the merger will result in increased revenue and cost savings of up to $1 billion per year for BT.\nThe acquisition of MCI's network infrastructure and customer base is expected to put pressure on BT's rivals as the British firm becomes a major player in the US telecoms market, which is worth an estimated $1.4 trillion.\n\"This is a transformational deal for BT. It firmly cements our position as a leading player in the global telecoms market,\" said BT CEO, Philip Jansen.\n\"With access to MCI's network and customer base, we can now deliver even better services, with faster speeds and improved reliability, to customers around the world.\"\nMCI has a large customer base, which is expected to give BT valuable access to new markets and enable it to offer more competitive pricing to its existing customers.\nBT is already one of the world's largest telecoms providers, with operations in over 180 countries. The merger with MCI will allow it to expand its reach even further, while also strengthening its position in the UK and Europe.\nThe deal is subject to approval from regulators in the US and Europe, but BT is confident that it will receive clearance in the coming months.\n\"We are committed to working closely with regulators to ensure that the merger is approved quickly and that our customers continue to receive the highest quality services,\" said Jansen.\nThe acquisition of MCI is part of BT's ongoing strategy to expand its operations and increase its global reach. Last year, the company acquired EE, the UK's largest mobile network operator, and it has also invested heavily in its fibre-optic network in recent years.\nThe merger with MCI is expected to enable BT to offer a more comprehensive range of services to its customers, including high-speed internet, voice services, and cloud-based solutions.\nBT is also expected to benefit from MCI's experience in cybersecurity, which will be increasingly important as the world becomes more connected and digital threats become more sophisticated.\nThe deal is seen as a bold move by BT, which has faced challenges in recent years due to increased competition and changing market conditions.\nHowever, the acquisition of MCI is expected to give the British firm a significant boost in the global telecoms market, as well as strengthening its position in the UK and Europe.\nThe merger is also expected to result in cost savings, which will be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices and improved services.\n\"BT's acquisition of MCI is a bold move that should pay off in the long term. It will give them a foothold in the world's biggest telecoms market and put pressure on rivals such as Verizon and AT&T,\" said Richard Waters, technology editor at the Financial Times.\n\"BT has been investing heavily in its network infrastructure and this acquisition will help to consolidate its position as one of the world's leading telecoms providers.\"\nThe merger between BT and MCI is expected to be completed in the second half of this year, subject to regulatory approval.", "An International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee's prison sentence has been reduced following a visit to Beijing by French President Emmanuel Macron.\nChristine Lagarde, the former head of the IMF, was found guilty of negligence in a French arbitration case involving state-owned bank Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and businessman Bernard Tapie in 2008. She was handed a suspended sentence of eight months in 2016.\nHowever, her sentence was reduced on Friday to one year of probation following the intervention of Macron. According to a statement from the Elys\u00e9e Palace, Macron had discussed the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to China last week.\n\"Lagarde's handling of the arbitration case was not acceptable and she has acknowledged her responsibility and apologized,\" the statement read. \"However, the sentence handed down was disproportionate. President Macron has therefore requested clemency for her and this request has been granted by the French justice system.\"\nLagarde welcomed the decision, saying it would allow her to continue her work at the IMF without the distraction of a legal case hanging over her head.\n\"I am very grateful to President Macron for his support and to the French justice system for their consideration of my case,\" she said in a statement. \"I will continue to serve the IMF to the best of my ability, which is my honor and duty.\"\nLagarde was appointed head of the IMF in 2011, becoming the first woman to hold the position. She was reappointed in 2016 for a second term, which is due to end in 2021.\nThe case against Lagarde stems from her time as French finance minister under President Nicolas Sarkozy. She was accused of negligence for allowing an arbitration panel to award Tapie \u20ac404 million ($453 million) in compensation for the disputed sale of sportswear maker Adidas.\nLagarde said she believed the panel's decision was the best outcome for the state. However, critics said the process was rigged in Tapie's favor, as he was a supporter of Sarkozy.\nTapie, who was also found guilty in the case, has been ordered to repay the compensation. He has denied any wrongdoing and is appealing the decision.", "The sun shines brightly on the dusty arena as the crowd cheers for the young bullfighter who emerges from the gates. He is a novice, dressed in traditional bullfighting attire and holding a red cape in his hand. Despite his inexperience, he is determined to face this powerful beast.\nMeet Juan Gomez, a 19-year-old from a small town in Colombia.

The automaker\u2019s profits were driven by strong truck and SUV sales in North America and cost-cutting measures.\nGM\u2019s earnings come as the company is in the midst of negotiating a new contract with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which recently ended a 40-day strike that cost the company an estimated $2 billion. GM was also hit by a separate strike in Canada, where nearly 2,000 workers went on strike for four weeks.\nDespite these challenges, GM managed to exceed analysts\u2019 expectations and post impressive earnings. The company\u2019s third-quarter revenue was $35.5 billion, up 6.3% from the same period last year. GM\u2019s profit margin was 8.6%, compared to 7.8% in the third quarter of 2018.\nGM\u2019s success was largely due to a strong performance in the North American market, particularly in the truck and SUV segments. The company\u2019s North American sales rose 6.3% in the third quarter, with trucks and SUVs accounting for 83% of its total sales.\nIn addition, GM implemented aggressive cost-cutting measures in the third quarter, including the closure of a plant in Ohio and the consolidation of marketing operations. The company also saw lower commodity costs and a favorable tax rate, which helped boost its profits.\nIn a statement, GM CEO Mary Barra said the company\u2019s strong performance was a result of \u201cthe focus and dedication of our employees around the world, who are working to transform our company and position it for long-term success.\u201d\nBarra also acknowledged the challenges posed by the UAW strike and the Canadian labor dispute, but said GM remained committed to negotiating fair and competitive contracts with its employees.\n\u201cWe understand the importance of our employees and the role they play in our success,\u201d Barra said. \u201cWe are committed to working with them to build a stronger, more competitive GM.\u201d\nGM\u2019s strong earnings come as the U.S. auto industry is facing a number of challenges, including declining sales and increasing competition from overseas rivals. In addition, the industry is grappling with the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, which are poised to disrupt traditional business models.\nGM has been investing heavily in electric and autonomous technology, and recently announced plans to introduce 20 new electric vehicles by 2023. The company has also been working on developing self-driving cars through its Cruise Automation subsidiary.\nDespite these bold initiatives, GM\u2019s traditional gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs continue to be its bread and butter. In fact, the company recently announced plans to revive the Hummer brand as an electric pickup truck, signaling a shift in its electric vehicle strategy.\nGM\u2019s success in the third quarter is a positive sign for the company and the auto industry as a whole. However, analysts caution that the company still faces significant challenges, particularly with the UAW negotiations and ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\nGM is not alone in facing these challenges, and the U.S. auto industry is likely to see continued disruption in the coming years. However, with its strong earnings and commitment to innovation, GM is well-positioned to weather these challenges and emerge as a leader in the new era of automotive technology.", "In a move that is likely to add fuel to the already tense relationship between China and the Dalai Lama, Beijing has once again urged Tibetans to embrace atheism as a counter to what it calls the \"reactionary\" influence of the exiled spiritual leader.\nAccording to the state-controlled media, China's State Administration for Religious Affairs has launched a campaign to promote atheism in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, home to the majority of Tibetans. The campaign was launched in response to the Dalai Lama's latest visit to the region, which was viewed by Beijing as an attempt to expand his influence over Tibetans.\nChina, which has long accused the Dalai Lama of fomenting separatism in Tibet, sees atheism as a key tool in curbing his influence. Officials have said that religion, particularly Tibetan Buddhism, has become a source of conflict in the region, and that atheism is the best way to promote stability and unity.\n\"In order to maintain social harmony and stability in Tibet, it is necessary to give full play to the positive role of atheism in guiding the masses,\" said a spokesman for the State Administration for Religious Affairs. \"Atheism can help to eliminate superstition and backward thinking, which are the root causes of instability and division.\"\nThis is not the first time that China has tried to promote atheism in the region. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the early years of Communist rule, religion was suppressed and monasteries were destroyed. Thousands of Tibetan monks and nuns were killed, and many more were forced to flee the country.\nHowever, in recent years, China has relaxed its stance somewhat, allowing for the practice of religion under government control. However, the Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 and has since lived in exile in India, has been a persistent thorn in China's side, speaking out against Chinese rule in Tibet and calling for greater autonomy for the region.\nThe latest move by China is likely to add to the tension between the two sides, and it remains to be seen how Tibetans will respond to the campaign. While some may see atheism as a welcome alternative to the often-restrictive and sometimes-oppressive nature of religion under Chinese rule, others are likely to view it as an attempt to erode Tibetan culture and identity.\nThe Dalai Lama himself has dismissed China's efforts, saying that true stability in Tibet can only come about through respect for human rights and genuine dialogue.\n\"By promoting atheism, China is only trying to suppress the culture and identity of the Tibetan people,\" he said in a statement. \"True stability will only come about when the rights of all Tibetans are respected, and they are given the freedom to practice their religion and preserve their culture.\"\nDespite the Dalai Lama's calls for dialogue and reconciliation, relations between the two sides remain strained. China has accused the Dalai Lama of being a \"splittist\" and has refused to engage in any meaningful dialogue with him or his representatives. Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama and his supporters continue to call for greater autonomy for Tibet and for an end to what they see as Chinese oppression.\nThe latest move by China is likely to further entrench the two sides, and it remains to be seen whether the campaign to promote atheism will help to bring about the stability and unity that Beijing is hoping for, or whether it will only serve to deepen the divisions between Tibetans and the Chinese authorities.", "In a significant move in the hotel industry, Stakis PLC has announced a $530 million deal to acquire the five Metropole Hotels owned by Lonrho PLC. The deal will be primarily funded by a rights issue of Stakis shares.\nThe Metropole Hotels are located in London, Brighton, Birmingham, Leeds, and Manchester. The properties will give Stakis a strong presence in some of the UK's key cities. Stakis is already a well-established hotel and gaming operator with 42 hotels and casinos throughout the UK.\n\"The acquisition of the prestigious Metropole Hotels brand will be a significant step forward in our strategy to build a major leisure business,\" said David Michels, the chief executive of Stakis. \"With an excellent geographic spread, these hotels will complement our existing portfolio perfectly.\"\nLonrho, a UK-based multinational conglomerate, had put the hotels up for sale as part of a restructuring plan. The five Metropole Hotels had been on the market for a few months, with several interested parties expressing an interest in the properties.\nStakis emerged as the most serious bidder, beating out rivals such as Hilton Hotels and Forte. The rights issue will be worth around $560 million, with the aim of funding the purchase and contributing towards future expansion.\n\"We firmly believe that this acquisition is in the best interests of our shareholders and marks the start of an exciting new phase in our company's development,\" said Michels.\nThe acquisition will take Stakis's hotel portfolio to 47, making it one of the largest hotel operators in the UK. The deal is expected to be completed within the next few months, subject to regulatory approval.\nStakis is optimistic about the synergies that the Metropole brand will bring to its existing portfolio. The company is confident that it can enhance the performance of the Metropole hotels through its expertise in the hospitality sector.\n\"The Metropole brand is a strong and established name in the hotel industry, and we are proud to welcome it into the Stakis family,\" said Michels.\nThe acquisition is also expected to bring benefits to the local economies of the cities where the Metropole hotels are located. Stakis's expansion plans include investing in the local communities and providing employment opportunities.\n\"Our commitment to the communities in which we operate is an essential part of our business philosophy,\" said Michels. \"We are looking forward to supporting and working closely with the local communities in each of the five cities where the Metropole Hotels are located.\"\nWhile Stakis's purchase of the Metropole Hotels is welcome news for the company, it remains to be seen how the market will respond. The shares in Stakis fell 5% in early trading following the announcement, reflecting some investors' concerns about the high price tag attached to the deal.\nHowever, others are more optimistic about the impact that the acquisition will have on Stakis's future growth prospects.\n\"It's a bold move by Stakis, but strategically, it makes sense,\" said one analyst. \"The Metropole brand has strong recognition and a loyal customer base. Bringing it under the Stakis umbrella will give the company greater scale and reach.\"\nStakis's rights issue is due to be launched in the next few weeks, subject to regulatory approval. The company is confident that its existing shareholders will support the move, which is seen as a key step in its long-term growth strategy.\n\"We have a clear vision for Stakis, and this acquisition is an important part of that vision,\" said Michels. \"We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to delivering on them in the months and years to come.\"", "The aluminium industry has expressed concerns over the ability of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the world's largest aluminium producer, to control output levels and support world prices, according to industry sources.\nKontsern Alyuminiy, based in Russia, has been facing rising costs due to the US sanctions and the supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the company has been increasing its output in recent years, leading to a glut in the aluminium market and putting pressure on global prices.\nIndustry experts warn that if Kontsern Alyuminiy continues to ramp up production, it could fuel overcapacity and cause a price crash similar to what happened in 2015, when China flooded the market with cheap aluminium.\n\"Kontsern Alyuminiy has been increasing its output levels for the past few years, even as the rest of the industry has been struggling. This has put pressure on global prices, making it difficult for other producers to compete,\" said an industry analyst who wished to remain anonymous.\n\"In light of the current economic climate, it is crucial for the industry to maintain a balance between supply and demand. If Kontsern Alyuminiy continues to produce at these levels, it could jeopardize the entire aluminium industry and lead to a crash in global prices.\"\nKontsern Alyuminiy has responded to these concerns by stating that it is committed to ensuring the stability of the aluminium market and will work with other producers to maintain a balance between supply and demand.\n\"We understand the importance of maintaining a stable aluminium market, and we recognize the concerns raised by our industry counterparts. We will continue to work closely with other producers to ensure that demand is met without causing any disruptions in the market,\" said a spokesperson for Kontsern Alyuminiy.\nHowever, industry insiders remain sceptical of the company's ability to control output levels, given its history of increasing production even in difficult economic conditions.\n\"Kontsern Alyuminiy's track record suggests that it prioritizes output over market stability. It will be difficult to trust the company to put the interests of the industry ahead of its own profits,\" said another industry expert.\nOthers have suggested that a more regulatory approach may be necessary to ensure that Kontsern Alyuminiy and other producers do not overproduce and cause a price crash.\n\"The aluminium industry needs to take a more proactive approach to regulating production levels and ensuring that the market remains stable. This could include setting production quotas or introducing other regulatory measures to prevent overcapacity,\" said a third industry analyst.\nThe aluminium industry is a crucial part of global manufacturing, used in everything from cars and airplanes to household appliances and construction materials. If prices crash due to overproduction, it could have a profound impact on the global economy and lead to job losses and economic instability.\nAs such, it is imperative that Kontsern Alyuminiy and other industry players work together to ensure that production levels are controlled and the market remains stable. Failure to do so could result in a repeat of the 2015 price crash, which the industry is still struggling to recover from.", "Hong Kong legislators are planning to launch a court action and lobbying mission to the United Kingdom as they try to save the city's elected legislature from being controlled by the government of China.\nLast year, the Chinese government introduced a new national security law that has had a profound impact on Hong Kong\u2019s political landscape. The law has been described as an attempt to extinguish pro-democracy sentiment in the territory, and has led to the arrest of several prominent pro-democracy figures.\nThe new law has also allowed the Chinese government to tighten its grip on Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, which has traditionally been an important arena for dissent and opposition to official policies. Many Hong Kong residents fear that the law will be used to further erode the city\u2019s autonomy and limit democratic rights.\nIn response to these developments, a group of Hong Kong legislators is planning to take legal action against the Chinese government. The legislators hope to argue that the national security law violates the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the treaty that governed Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997. Under the terms of that treaty, Hong Kong was supposed to retain a high degree of autonomy and freedom of expression.\nIn addition to the court action, the group of legislators is planning to travel to the United Kingdom to lobby the British government for support. The UK was the former colonial power in Hong Kong, and many Hong Kong residents still hold British passports.\nThe legislators hope that the UK will use its international influence to put pressure on China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and democratic rights. They also hope that the UK will offer safe haven to Hong Kong residents who fear persecution under the new national security law.\nThe move by the legislators is a bold one, and is likely to put them at even greater risk of arrest and prosecution by the Chinese government. However, the group says that they are willing to take the risk in order to defend the democratic rights of Hong Kong residents.\nThe action also highlights the growing divide between Hong Kong and the Chinese government. The new national security law has been widely criticized by human rights organizations and Western governments, who say that it is a clear violation of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and democratic rights.\nIn response, the Chinese government has accused the West of interfering in its internal affairs, and has said that the national security law is necessary to maintain stability and security in Hong Kong.\nThe situation in the former British colony has also become a point of tension between China and the West. The US has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials who were involved in the introduction of the national security law, and has offered asylum to Hong Kong residents.\nThe UK has also been more vocal in its criticism of China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong. In January, the British government announced that it would offer citizenship to up to 3 million Hong Kong residents who hold BNO (British National Overseas) passports.\nThe move by the Hong Kong legislators is likely to further strain relations between China and the UK. Chinese officials have already warned that the UK\u2019s offer of citizenship to Hong Kong residents is a violation of Chinese sovereignty.\nHowever, the Hong Kong legislators say that they are committed to defending the democratic rights of Hong Kong residents, and are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal.\n\u201cThis is not just about Hong Kong. It\u2019s about the values of democracy and human rights that are under threat all over the world,\u201d said one of the legislators. \u201cWe hope that our actions will inspire people around the world to stand up for what is right and just.\u201d", "The Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy has launched an investigation into alleged drug kingpin involvement in the oil industry. The move comes after a recent report by a Colombian non-governmental organization revealed that several oil companies in the country had possible links to drug trafficking organizations.\nThe investigation will focus on the business operations of several oil companies that are said to have had connections with drug cartels. This includes examining the ownership structures of these companies, their financial transactions and their relationships with other businesses and individuals involved in the drug trade.\nThe report by the non-governmental organization, which was released last month, raised concerns about the potential risks faced by foreign companies that invest in the Colombian oil industry. According to the report, some oil companies have allegedly collaborated with drug traffickers to launder money, while other companies may have unwittingly become involved in these illegal activities.\nThe Colombian government has been working to combat drug trafficking and other criminal activities in the country for many years. However, this latest development shows that these criminal activities continue to pose a significant threat to the country's economy and stability.\nThe government has already taken several steps to address the problem. Last year, the Ministry of Mines and Energy introduced a new code of conduct for oil industry companies operating in the country, which includes measures to prevent the involvement of these companies in illegal activities such as money laundering.\nHowever, the new investigation is a clear indication that more needs to be done to address the issue of drug kingpin involvement in the oil industry. The Colombian government has stated that it is committed to ensuring that its natural resources are not used to finance criminal activities.\nThe investigation is also likely to have significant implications for the oil industry in Colombia. Many foreign companies that have invested in the industry may be concerned about the risks associated with doing business in a country where drug trafficking is still a major problem.\nIt remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation will be, but the government has already warned that it will not hesitate to take action against any companies found to be collaborating with drug cartels. This could include fines and legal sanctions, as well as the cancellation of contracts and revocation of licenses for companies found to be involved in illegal activities.\nThe Colombian government is also likely to face pressure from the international community to take action against drug trafficking and other criminal activities in the country. The United States, which has provided significant support to Colombia in its efforts to combat drug trafficking, is likely to be particularly concerned about the implications of these allegations for the country's stability and security.\nOverall, this latest development shows that the fight against drug trafficking and other criminal activities in Colombia remains a major challenge for the government and the international community. The investigation by the Ministry of Mines and Energy is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done to ensure that Colombian natural resources are not used to finance criminal activities.", "Imperial Tobacco Group, one of the world's leading tobacco companies, has announced plans to separate from Hanson Plc, an industrial conglomerate, citing concerns over the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.\nThe decision to split comes after Imperial Tobacco Group faced mounting pressure from regulators and activists over its role in the global tobacco industry, which has long been associated with harmful health effects.\nImperial Tobacco Group's decision to split from Hanson Plc is expected to allow the tobacco company to better position itself in response to the increasing scrutiny it faces from governments, public health advocates, and consumers.\nAccording to a statement released by Imperial Tobacco Group, the company will be rebranded as \"Imperial Brands\" following the split, and will focus solely on its tobacco business.\nImperial Brands will also have access to funds that were previously reserved for Hanson Plc, which will allow it to invest in new products and technologies to help reduce the health risks associated with tobacco use.\nCommenting on the decision, Imperial Tobacco Group CEO Alison Cooper said, \"We believe that this is the right move for Imperial Tobacco Group, given the changing regulatory landscape and the increasing concern among consumers about the health risks associated with tobacco use.\"\nCooper added, \"We remain committed to delivering high-quality, innovative products that meet the evolving needs of our customers, while also seeking to reduce the harm caused by our products.\"\nThe decision to split from Hanson Plc comes as the tobacco industry faces increased pressure from regulators and the public over concerns about its marketing practices, the impact of tobacco use on public health, and allegations that tobacco companies have intentionally misled consumers about the health risks associated with tobacco use.\nIn recent years, a number of countries and localities have implemented restrictions on the sale and marketing of tobacco products, including bans on advertising and sponsorship of sports events.\nIn addition, several lawsuits have been filed against tobacco companies in recent years, alleging that they were responsible for the health problems caused by cigarette smoking.\nLast year, five major tobacco companies agreed to pay billions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by the US government over allegations that they had intentionally misled consumers about the health risks associated with smoking.\nWhile the tobacco industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, it remains a major global industry, generating billions of dollars in revenue annually.\nAccording to a report by the World Health Organization, tobacco use is responsible for more than 8 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries.\nDespite the health risks associated with tobacco use, the industry continues to enjoy significant support from policymakers in many countries, as well as from consumers who are addicted to nicotine.\nImperial Tobacco Group's decision to split from Hanson Plc is expected to allow the company to better navigate the challenges it faces in the years to come.\nBy focusing solely on its tobacco business, Imperial Brands will be better positioned to respond to regulatory changes and consumer preferences, while also investing in new technologies and products to reduce the health risks associated with tobacco use.\nThe decision to split also signals the growing recognition among tobacco companies that they must take a more proactive approach to addressing the health risks of their products, rather than simply fighting regulatory efforts to restrict their products or limit their marketing practices.\nOverall, the decision by Imperial Tobacco Group to split from Hanson Plc is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the future of the tobacco industry, and it is likely to have significant implications for the industry in the years to come.", "Meredith Corp CEO, William T. Kerr, has announced plans to acquire more television stations in 1997 due to a decline in prices. While this move may surprise some, Kerr believes that it is an opportune time for his company to expand its reach.\nIn recent years, the cost of owning and operating television stations has been on the rise. However, Kerr's team has noted a decrease in prices over the past few months. With this in mind, Kerr plans to take advantage of the current market conditions to acquire new television stations that will help expand the company's profile.\nMeredith Corp is a leading media and marketing company that specializes in publishing, broadcasting, and marketing services for various industries. The company currently owns and operates 17 television stations across the country, including CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox affiliates.\nKerr believes that the acquisition of more stations will give Meredith Corp a stronger presence in the broadcasting industry. He is confident that the company can successfully navigate the challenges that come with owning and operating television stations, and believes this move will be beneficial for both the company and its clients.\n\"Our goal is to find television stations that complement our existing portfolio and give us an even stronger platform for providing our advertising and marketing services to clients,\" Kerr said in a recent statement. \"We are excited about the opportunity to expand our reach and build on our success to date.\"\nWhile the exact number of stations Meredith Corp plans to acquire has not been disclosed, industry analysts predict that the company will likely pursue deals that are around $100 million or less. This is a significant decrease from typical acquisition prices in the past.\nIn addition to its television station acquisitions, Kerr is also exploring other ways to expand Meredith Corp's reach in the media industry. This includes partnerships with other media companies and increasing the company's digital presence.\nDespite some uncertainty in the industry due to the rise of streaming services and changes in consumer viewing habits, Kerr remains optimistic about the future of television broadcasting and Meredith Corp's ability to weather any potential storms.\n\"We believe there is still a significant opportunity for growth in the television industry, and we are committed to staying at the forefront of these changes,\" he said. \"With our long history of success and our talented team, we are confident that we can continue to lead the way in providing high-quality content and advertising opportunities for our clients.\"\nAs the year progresses, it will be interesting to see how Meredith Corp's acquisition plans unfold and how they will impact the company's overall strategy. For now, Kerr and his team are focused on positioning the company for long-term success in the ever-changing media landscape.", "Trans World Airlines Inc. is searching for a new CEO to navigate the troubled waters that the company has been facing over the past few years. The company has been struggling to stay afloat amid increasing competition from low-cost airlines and rising fuel costs.\nSources within the company have confirmed that the search for a new CEO began last month after the current CEO, John Smith, announced his retirement. Smith has been with the company for over 20 years and has been credited with turning the airline around after it filed for bankruptcy in 1992. However, he has been unable to steer the company through the latest challenges it faces.\nTWA's troubles began in 2016 when the company reported its first loss in three years. The airline has been hit hard by rising fuel costs, which have eaten into its profits. In addition, the company has been facing increasing competition from low-cost airlines like Southwest and JetBlue.\nThe airline industry has been going through major changes in recent years, with consolidation and mergers becoming the new normal. TWA has been struggling to keep up with these changes, and its financial position has been deteriorating rapidly. The company has been forced to cut costs, reduce its workforce, and reduce the number of flights it operates.\nIn response to these challenges, TWA has been exploring options like mergers and acquisitions. The company has been in talks with several potential partners, but so far, no deal has materialized. Analysts believe that TWA needs a new CEO who can bring fresh ideas and a new perspective to the company.\n\"TWA has been in a difficult position for a while now, and it needs someone who can take charge and turn things around,\" said John Doe, a financial analyst with XYZ Securities. \"The new CEO should have experience in the airline industry, and be able to navigate the complex challenges facing the company.\"\nThe search for a new CEO is being led by TWA's board of directors, which has appointed a search committee to identify suitable candidates. The committee is said to be looking for someone with a proven track record of success in the airline industry, and who can inspire confidence and lead the company through the challenging times ahead.\n\"TWA is looking for someone who can bring fresh ideas and a new perspective to the company,\" said Jane Smith, head of the search committee. \"We are looking for someone who can inspire the employees, work with the board of directors, and lead the company to success.\"\nWhile the search for a new CEO is underway, TWA is being led by an interim CEO. The company has said that it expects to find a new CEO within the next few months.\nThe search for a new CEO comes at a time when the airline industry is facing major challenges. Rising fuel costs, increasing competition, and changing consumer preferences are all factors that are affecting airlines worldwide. These challenges require a new approach and a new way of thinking, which is what TWA is hoping to find in its new CEO.\nDespite its current challenges, TWA has a rich history and a loyal customer base. The airline was founded in 1930 and has been a major player in the aviation industry for decades. It has faced numerous challenges over the years, but has always managed to survive and thrive.\n\"TWA has a long and proud history, and we are committed to continuing that legacy,\" said John Smith, the outgoing CEO. \"We need someone who can bring the company into the future and lead it through the challenges ahead.\"\nThe search for a new CEO is a critical moment for TWA, and the company's future is riding on the outcome. The airline industry is changing rapidly, and TWA needs to find the right leader to navigate its path forward. With the right CEO in place, TWA has the potential to overcome its current challenges and emerge stronger than ever before.", "Singapore-based filtration solutions provider, Memtec Ltd, has revealed that its recent failure to secure a US$280 million takeover deal with a global rival will not have any impact on its earnings or expansion plans, as the firm looks to new growth opportunities beyond the deal.\nThe potential takeover deal that was in the works for several months with an undisclosed global rival, who had expressed an interest in Memtec's proprietary water filtration technology and other product offerings, was canceled due to issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Memtec's CEO, David Gwee, expressed confidence that the company has the resources to continue to grow even without the expected investment.\n\"Our long-term strategy remains the same \u2013 to expand our footprint in the global filtration solutions industry and to introduce innovative solutions that make a difference in people's lives. While it is true that we were in discussions with a potential investor that had exciting possibilities, we have the confidence to continue in our growth endeavors,\" Gwee stated.\nHe added that Memtec is already in talks with other firms in the filtration solutions space. The company's focus is now on developing new products that meet the fast-changing market needs and investing in the company's research and development capabilities.\nMemtec, which has been in the filtration solutions business for over 30 years, has made significant strides in the sector by using advanced materials and technologies to streamline filtration processes. Apart from water filtration products, the company also offers ultrafiltration systems for industrial, pharmaceutical, and dairy/food and beverage applications.\nThe company has invested heavily in research and development and recently tripled its production capacity to support growing demand for its high-quality filtration products. With the recent setback of the failed takeover deal, the company has doubled down on its efforts to expand organically while seeking new collaborations and partnerships.\n\"Memtec has established a solid reputation as a reliable producer of top-quality filtration solutions, and we are confident in our ability to grow our business. We are already working on several exciting new projects, and in the coming months, we are eager to see the fruition of those efforts,\" Gwee said. \nAnalysts observe that Memtec's resilient nature will be an asset in the company's ability to continue to grow, even in the face of economic challenges and obstacles. With the company's successful IPO in 2019, it has the support of a strong shareholder base, including Temasek Holdings, which provides a solid financial footing for its future initiatives.", "Tech giant Apple Inc has reported a surprise profit in its fourth quarter financial results, sending its stock price up by 4.5% in after-hours trading.\nThe company's earnings report, released on Thursday, revealed that Apple generated a revenue of $64.7 billion - a strong performance that surpassed analysts' expectations. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic causing economic headwinds for Apple, the tech giant was able to maintain momentum and produce positive results in a tough market.\nApple's net income for the quarter was $12.7 billion, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared to a $2.5 billion net loss in the same period a year ago. Gross margin, a key measure of profitability, was 38.2%, up from 37.9% in the year-ago period.\nThe key driver behind Apple's better-than-expected performance was its growth in sales in both its iPhone and Mac product lines. The company reported $26.4 billion in iPhone sales, a 21% increase from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, Mac sales were up by 29% on a year-over-year basis, generating $9 billion in revenue.\nApple's strong performance in the fourth quarter follows a challenging period for the company, with the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic causing significant uncertainty and disruption. However, the company's ability to adapt quickly and make strategic decisions helped it to weather the storm.\nOne significant factor in Apple's success was the company's strong ecosystem of products and services, which includes devices such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, as well as services such as the App Store, Apple TV, and Apple Music. This broad portfolio of products and services helped Apple to remain resilient in a challenging market and maintain its competitive edge.\nApple CEO Tim Cook commented on the company's fourth quarter results, saying that \"this quarter for Apple wouldn't have been possible without the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide. We're grateful and humbled by their resilience and heart in serving our customers and communities.\"\nThe news of Apple's positive financial results was well-received by investors, with the company's stock price jumping by 4.5% in after-hours trading. Apple's stock has been on a steady upward trajectory over the past year, thanks in part to the ongoing success of its iPhone product line.\nThe upbeat news from Apple is also likely to have a ripple effect in the broader tech market, with investors looking for positive signs in a climate of uncertainty and economic volatility. The strong performance of major tech companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft, is seen as a bellwether for the broader market, and a sign of optimism that the economy is beginning to recover.\nLooking ahead, Apple is expected to continue to drive growth through a combination of product innovation and expansion into new markets. The company is reportedly working on a range of new products, including a potential new VR headset and the rumored Apple Car. Meanwhile, Apple's services business is expected to continue to grow, with the company focusing on areas such as Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Arcade.\nDespite the challenges that lie ahead, Apple's strong financial performance in the fourth quarter is a testament to the company's resilience and adaptability, and its ability to thrive in a challenging market. As the economy continues to recover, Apple is well-positioned to benefit from a rebound in consumer spending and demand for new and innovative technology products.", "The Ivory Coast is set to regain its position as a global coffee powerhouse after years of neglect that have seen the country's coffee output drop significantly. According to coffee experts, Ivory Coast coffee production is set to reach pre-neglect levels over the next few years thanks to various initiatives and projects targeted at reviving the sector.\nFor many years, Ivory Coast was one of the world's top coffee producers, with the country's coffee beans highly sought-after for their excellent quality and unique flavor. However, years of political instability, poor management, and underinvestment saw the industry's fortunes decline rapidly.\nOver the past few years, however, Ivory Coast's government has taken a more proactive stance towards revitalizing the sector, realizing the potential economic benefits that a thriving coffee industry could bring. The government has set up various initiatives aimed at improving the quality and quantity of Ivory Coast coffee, including providing funding for small-scale coffee farmers, offering training programs and technical assistance, and establishing infrastructure to support the sector.\nOne of the most significant initiatives has been the establishment of the Coffee and Cocoa Council, a government body that oversees the development of the coffee and cocoa sectors. The council has been instrumental in providing support to small-scale coffee farmers, helping them improve their production techniques and access international markets. It has also worked to promote the Ivorian coffee brand, increasing awareness of the high-quality coffee produced in the country.\nAnother critical project that has contributed to the revival of Ivory Coast's coffee industry is the National Coffee Development Plan, which was launched in 2015. The plan aims to increase coffee production and improve the quality of Ivorian coffee by providing financial support to farmers and investing in infrastructure such as irrigation systems, mills, and warehouses. It also seeks to improve the coffee value chain by promoting local processing and encouraging the export of value-added products such as roasted coffee.\nThe efforts of the government and other stakeholders in the industry are beginning to yield results, with Ivory Coast's coffee production increasing steadily over the past few years. According to the International Coffee Organization, Ivory Coast produced 500,000 bags of coffee in 2020, up from 200,000 in 2016, and expects to produce 600,000 bags in 2021.\nCoffee experts predict that Ivory Coast's coffee production could even reach pre-neglect levels within the next few years, as the government continues to invest in the industry and coffee farmers adopt modern production techniques. Ivory Coast could potentially become one of the world's leading coffee producers once again, competing with countries such as Brazil and Colombia.\nThe revival of Ivory Coast's coffee industry is not only good news for the country but also for coffee lovers worldwide who appreciate the unique flavor of Ivorian coffee. Ivory Coast coffee is known for its subtle acidity, full body, and floral notes, making it a true treat for coffee connoisseurs.\nIn conclusion, Ivory Coast's coffee industry is on the cusp of a renaissance, with coffee production set to reach pre-neglect levels thanks to various initiatives and projects targeted at revitalizing the sector. Ivory Coast has the potential to become one of the world's leading coffee producers once again, and with the government's commitment and various other stakeholders' efforts, this could become a reality within the next few years. Ivory Coast coffee is set to take its place among the world's best, satisfying the taste buds of coffee lovers worldwide.", "China's metals futures trading should be limited to just one or two exchanges due to low trading volumes, according to industry experts. A recent report by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association revealed that trading volumes for metals futures on the country's exchanges have been declining over the past few years, leading many to call for a consolidation of the market.\nCurrently, there are six exchanges in China that trade metals futures, including the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the Dalian Commodity Exchange, and the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. However, trading volumes on these exchanges have been relatively low, with many only seeing a few hundred contracts traded each day.\nThis low trading volume has been attributed to a number of factors, including the overall decline in China's economic growth, as well as the country's efforts to crack down on speculative trading. In addition, many traders have shifted their focus to other investment opportunities, such as stocks and real estate, which have been performing well in recent years.\nIndustry experts have suggested that consolidating the market to just one or two exchanges could help boost trading volumes and improve liquidity. This would also make it easier for traders to access the market, as they would only need to monitor one or two exchanges instead of several.\n\"Consolidating the market would help to reduce the number of participants and simplify the trading process,\" said Zhao Xiaoyong, a metals analyst with Jinrui Futures. \"This would make it easier for traders to access the market and could help to boost trading volumes.\"\nHowever, there are concerns that limiting metals futures trading to just one or two exchanges could lead to a monopolization of the market, with larger players dominating the trade. This could also make it more difficult for smaller traders to compete, leading to a lack of diversity in the market.\n\"Limiting the market to just one or two exchanges could lead to a concentration of power, with larger players dominating the trade,\" said Li Hong, an independent commodities analyst. \"This could also make it more difficult for smaller traders and investors to enter the market, leading to a lack of diversity.\"\nDespite these concerns, many in the industry agree that something needs to be done to boost trading volumes in China's metals futures market. Whether that involves consolidating the market or finding other ways to increase liquidity, it is clear that changes will need to be made in order to make the market more appealing to traders.\n\"With the decline in trading volumes and the overall slowdown in China's economy, it is clear that something needs to be done to boost the market,\" said Chris Wang, a metals analyst with CFETS. \"While there are concerns about limiting the number of exchanges, there are also benefits to consolidating the market. It will be up to regulators and industry experts to find the best solution for China's metals futures market.\"", "Hong Kong was in a state of chaos on Tuesday as protesters clashed with police over the selection of the city's future leaders. China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, had arrived in the city to oversee the selection process, sparking outrage amongst pro-democracy protesters.\nThe selection process for Hong Kong's leaders has been a contentious issue for years, with many calling for greater autonomy from the Chinese government. Last year, protests erupted after the Chinese government proposed a national security law that would allow them to crack down on dissent in the city. The law was eventually passed, and many pro-democracy activists were jailed or forced to flee the city.\nTuesday's protests were the largest the city has seen in years, with thousands of people taking to the streets to voice their anger over the selection process. The protesters, many of whom were wearing masks and carrying banners, were met by a heavy police presence. Riot police were seen firing tear gas and pepper spray at the protesters, who responded by throwing rocks and bottles at the police.\nThe clashes continued for hours, with both sides refusing to back down. The Chinese government issued a statement condemning the protests, calling them \"illegal\" and \"violent.\" They also accused the protesters of trying to \"subvert the rule of law.\"\nPro-democracy activists, however, argue that they are fighting for the freedoms and rights of the people of Hong Kong. They say that the Chinese government is trying to impose its will on the city, and that the selection process for the city's leaders is rigged in favor of pro-Beijing candidates.\nThe selection process itself is also a point of contention. Under Hong Kong's constitution, known as the Basic Law, the city's leader is chosen by a committee of 1,200 people, most of whom are pro-Beijing loyalists. Critics argue that this system is undemocratic and unrepresentative of the people of Hong Kong.\nWang Yi's arrival in the city was seen as a provocation by many pro-democracy activists, who see him as a symbol of Chinese interference in Hong Kong's affairs. His presence in the city is also a reminder of the Chinese government's growing influence in the former British colony.\nThe clashes between protesters and police on Tuesday are likely to further inflame tensions in the city. Many fear that the situation in Hong Kong could spiral out of control, leading to greater violence and instability in the region.", "In a major development in the Australian banking industry, St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia have joined forces to create the country's fifth-largest bank. The merger will bring together the strengths of both entities, enabling the new bank to offer a wider range of products and services to its customers.\nThe merger was announced after months of negotiations between the two banks.

In a statement, he said, \"This is an exciting development for both banks and our customers. The merger will enable us to offer a wider range of products and services, and to build on the strengths of both our brands.\"\nThe merger will bring together two banks with a long history in Australia. St George Bank was founded in 1937 and has grown to become one of the country's largest banks. Advance Bank was established in the 1860s and has been a leading provider of banking services to Australian consumers and businesses.\nThe merger is expected to deliver significant cost savings for both banks. It will also enable the new entity to invest in new technology and innovation, and to improve its customer service capabilities.\nThe news of the merger has been well received by customers of both banks. John Smith, a customer of St George Bank, said, \"I think this is a great move for the bank. I've been a customer for many years and have always been impressed by their service. I'm sure that the merger will only make things better for us.\"\nSimilarly, David Jones, a customer of Advance Bank, said, \"I'm excited about the merger because it means that we'll have access to more products and services. I've been a loyal customer of Advance Bank for many years and I'm sure that the new bank will continue to serve us well.\"\nThe merger comes at a time of significant change in the Australian banking sector. In recent years, competition has intensified, with new players entering the market and traditional banks facing pressure from fintech startups.\nIndustry experts believe that the merger between St George Bank and Advance Bank will help to position the new entity as a strong player in the competitive banking landscape. It will also enable the new bank to better compete with the \"big four\" banks \u2013 Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ, and National Australia Bank.\nThe news of the merger has also been welcomed by shareholders of both banks. The share prices of both St George Bank and Advance Bank have risen in the wake of the announcement.\nIn conclusion, the merger between St George Bank and Advance Bank Australia represents a significant development in the Australian banking sector. The creation of a new entity will enable the banks to offer a wider range of products and services to their customers, as well as delivering significant cost savings. With a combined network of more than 600 branches, St George Advance is set to become a major player in the Australian banking landscape.", "Czech National Bank proposes merging two banks to create largest post-Communist Eastern European megabank and privatising \"Big Four\"\nThe Czech National Bank (CNB) has proposed merging two of the country's largest state-owned banks, \u010cesk\u00e1 spo\u0159itelna and Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka, to create the largest post-Communist Eastern European megabank. The merger, which would create a bank with \u20ac173 billion ($195 billion) in assets, would represent a major consolidation of the Czech banking sector.\nThe CNB believes that the merger would improve the banks' competitiveness and ability to provide services to customers. The move comes as the country's banking sector struggles with historically low interest rates, increasing competition from fintech startups, and rising regulatory costs.\nSpeaking about the potential merger, CNB Governor Ji\u0159\u00ed Rusnok said: \"We believe that the creation of a large, efficient and competitive bank will be a significant asset for the Czech economy. This would help secure the long-term stability and development of the Czech financial sector, and would be positive for customers and the wider financial services industry.\"\nThe proposed merger would be the latest in a series of consolidations in the European banking sector. Banks in Europe have been under increasing pressure to merge in order to boost profits and remain competitive, as low interest rates and rising compliance costs squeeze margins.\nIn addition to the proposed merger, the CNB has also suggested the privatisation of the \"Big Four\" banks in the country - \u010cesk\u00e1 spo\u0159itelna, Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka, UniCredit Bank Czech Republic and Slovakia, and Raiffeisenbank. The move would allow the banks to access private capital, and could improve their ability to compete with international banks.\nThe CNB's proposal has been met with mixed reactions from analysts and industry experts. Some believe that the merger and privatisation could help to improve the stability and competitiveness of the Czech banking sector, while others have raised concerns about the impact on consumers and the potential for reduced competition in the market.\n\"This is a bold move by the CNB, and it could potentially have significant implications for the Czech economy and the wider European banking sector,\" said Fran\u00e7ois-Alexandre Racine, a senior analyst at S&P Global Ratings. \"On one hand, consolidation can help to improve efficiency and reduce costs, but on the other hand, it could lead to less competition in the market, which could be negative for consumers.\"\nThe CNB has indicated that any merger or privatisation of the Big Four banks would need to be carefully managed to ensure that competition is preserved and customers are protected. The regulator has also raised the possibility that the banks could remain partly state-owned, with the government holding a minority stake.\nThe proposed merger and privatisation could mark a major turning point for the Czech banking sector, which has struggled to compete with larger international banks in recent years. Despite the challenges faced by the sector, however, there are still opportunities for growth and innovation.\n\"We believe that the Czech banking sector has the potential to be a leader in digital innovation and customer service, as well as in expanding into new markets,\" said Rusnok. \"By consolidating the sector and opening it up to private capital, we can create a more dynamic and competitive industry that benefits all stakeholders.\"\nThe CNB's proposal is likely to face significant scrutiny from government officials, industry experts, and the general public in the coming months. However, if executed successfully, it could pave the way for a brighter future for the Czech banking sector, and help to position the country as a leading player in the European financial services industry.", "On Tuesday, giant agricultural commodities trader, Archer Daniels Midland Co, commonly known as ADM, agreed to plead guilty to price fixing and agree to pay record fines. The company has allegedly been involved in unlawful practices, such as manipulating the price of lysine and citric acid products to increase its profits and gain a competitive advantage.\nADM, one of the largest commodity trading companies in the world, has been accused of engaging in anti-competitive practices with rivals between 1992 and 1995. The Department of Justice, DoJ, has been investigating the company since 2012, along with other trading houses like Cargill, Tate & Lyle, and others. Around seven felony counts of price-fixing have been levied against the company, for which it agreed to pay a whopping $56 million in fines. The settlement amounts to a record for lysine, which is often used as animal feed.\nIn a statement, ADM\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, apologized for the accusations. \"ADM believes a settlement is the best outcome for its shareholders and for resolving the U.S. lysine antitrust case,\" Luciano said. \"We regret the actions that were taken long ago by some former employees which resulted in this conduct, and we are pleased to finally reach a resolution.\u201d\nThe DoJ, however, will continue to investigate the executive personnel involved in this scandal that resulted in price fixing. Despite the company\u2019s promises to take corrective measures, at least three of the executives implicated in the case still hold leadership titles at different companies or corporations.\nCritics of the settlement argue that the executives\u2019 lack of accountability does not align with the severity of their actions. \"Despite this unprecedented fine, the settlements themselves do not include any individual defendants or current executives, as is typical of most antitrust cases settled by the government,\u201d said Michelle Chan, Economic Policy Program Director at Friends of the Earth. \u201cWithout a full reckoning of all those involved and all those who benefited from ADM's unlawful price-fixing, it is unlikely that the public and ADM's customers will gain confidence in fair markets.\u201d\nADM\u2019s alleged price-fixing has had significant impacts on the market. Lysine prices allegedly rose to twice what they should have been, rising as high as $2.75 per pound at their peak. Higher prices for lysine, an essential and popular animal feed ingredient, can ultimately lead to more expensive meat, eggs, and milk for the average consumer.\nADM's negative impact on the market doesn\u2019t end with its involvement in price-fixing. In 2019, ADM was found guilty of making corrupt payments in Brazil, which led to a $54-million settlement with a U.S. regulator. It also faced allegations of polluting rivers and groundwater in Iowa.\nADM is one of the many large conglomerates that are accused of monopolizing the market and threatening the welfare of consumers. But, with more scrutiny coming its way, it is likely that ADM will face more probes and lawsuits in the future. The current plea deal of ADM is supposed to pave the way for the DoJ to bring criminal charges against the executives involved.\nMany consumer and advocacy groups are focusing on the lack of personal accountability in this case. \u201cUnless and until individuals who were involved in price-fixing are held accountable for their actions, we will never fully deter this type of behavior and the negative impacts it has on consumers and the economy,\u201d said the Consumers Union, a consumer rights advocacy organization. \u201cIt's essential that the Department of Justice takes deliberate steps to go beyond corporate settlements, including prosecuting individuals and holding accountable any executives who personally violated the law.\"\nThe settlement of prices and payment of fines by ADM is a noteworthy achievement for the DoJ and a wake-up call for other big companies who might have monopolized the market. However, the lack of personal accountability brings scrutiny to the effectiveness and fairness of the justice system and creates a hurdle for ADM to win back consumer trust, which is vital for any company in the market. ADM still has a long way to go to regain public confidence and to expunge their official association with the ongoing litigations.", "Grand Metropolitan, a British multinational company, has forecasted that it will be able to return cash to shareholders in 1998. The company's executives made this announcement at the annual general meeting, held on Thursday.\nThe company, which is headquartered in London and operates in several sectors including food and drinks, entertainment, and hotels, has been systematically reducing its debts over the past few years. It has undertaken asset sales and structural changes, which have resulted in significant cost savings.\n\"We have worked hard to simplify our business and focus on our core strengths,\" said George Bull, the company's chairman. \"We have also been disciplined in managing costs and driving efficiency. As a result, we are confident that we will have the capacity to return cash to our shareholders in the near future.\"\nInvestors welcomed the news, with the company's share price rising by 2.5% after the announcement. Some analysts believe that the company may announce a share buyback program or a special dividend later in the year.\nHowever, not all investors were completely satisfied with the company's performance. Some questioned why the company had not returned cash to shareholders earlier, given that its net income has been increasing steadily in recent years.\n\"I am glad that the company is finally talking about returning cash to shareholders, but I can't help feeling that this should have happened earlier,\" said Sarah Foster, a private investor who attended the meeting. \"We have been patient and loyal shareholders, and I think we deserved better treatment.\"\nDespite these concerns, most shareholders seemed optimistic about the company's future prospects. Grand Metropolitan has a strong portfolio of brands, including Guinness, Smirnoff, and Burger King, which are well-positioned in global markets. It also has a new CEO, John West, who joined the company last year and is widely respected in the industry.\n\"We believe that Grand Metropolitan has a bright future ahead,\" said Bull. \"We will continue to invest in our brands and our people, and we are committed to delivering value for our shareholders.\"", "In a move that could have a serious impact on the Russian economy, the government is considering freezing domestic energy prices. This decision risks undermining recent oil industry reforms and the broader economic recovery that has been taking place in the country.\nThe potential freeze on energy prices would aim to reduce costs for consumers struggling with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it would come at a cost to the energy companies that have worked hard to increase investment in domestic oil production and exports. Russia is heavily dependent on the oil and gas industry for its economic growth and is one of the world's largest energy producers.\nUnder the current market-based pricing system, Russian oil producers are able to sell their output at higher prices on the global market. The government has been using this extra revenue to finance much-needed reforms in areas such as healthcare and education. However, a freeze on domestic energy prices would likely lead to a reduction in oil industry profits, making these reforms more difficult to achieve.\nThere are also concerns that a freeze on energy prices could discourage further investment in the oil industry. Companies could become less willing to take on new projects or expand their existing operations if they believe that their profits will be artificially limited. This, in turn, could lead to lower levels of oil production and exports, damaging the Russian economy even further.\nMoreover, a freeze on energy prices could also harm the competitiveness of Russian energy producers on the global market. With lower profits at home, companies may find it more difficult to compete with international rivals who do not face the same price restrictions. This could limit the amount of oil that Russian companies are able to export, further damaging the economy.\nRussian officials have suggested that the potential freeze on energy prices is still being discussed and has not yet been finalized. However, the news has already raised concerns among investors and oil industry stakeholders. Some have called on the government to find alternative ways to support struggling consumers, such as targeted subsidies or tax breaks.\nOthers have pointed out that a freeze on energy prices could damage Russia's long-term energy and economic strategy. The country has been working hard to diversify its economy away from its dependence on oil and gas exports. However, a freeze on energy prices could send the message that Russia is still reliant on this sector and is willing to undermine its own reforms in order to support it.\nIn conclusion, the potential freeze on domestic energy prices in Russia has the potential to seriously impact the country's oil industry and broader economic reforms. While the government may hope to provide much-needed relief to struggling consumers, the move risks reducing industry profits, discouraging investment, and harming competitiveness. It remains to be seen whether the government will pursue this policy in the face of such significant risks and uncertainty. Investors and industry stakeholders will be watching developments closely over the coming weeks and months.", "Hewlett-Packard (HP) has unveiled a strategic plan to boost sales of its encryption technology for secure online commerce. The move comes amid growing concerns about cyber threats, data breaches, and online fraud.\nAccording to HP's plan, the company will invest in research and development of new encryption products, expand its marketing efforts, and partner with key players in the e-commerce industry to promote the use of secure payment technologies, among other initiatives.\n\"HP is dedicated to helping businesses and consumers protect their sensitive data and mitigate the risks of online transactions,\" said Robyn Westervelt, Vice President and General Manager of HP Security. \"Our encryption technology solutions offer the highest level of security and trust for online commerce and business operations.\"\nEncryption technology is a critical tool for preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data online. It works by transforming plain text into encoded text, which can only be read by authorized parties. Encryption is used extensively in online banking, e-commerce, and other industries that handle confidential information.\nDespite the benefits of encryption, many businesses still do not use it or use it only sparingly. This puts them at risk of data breaches, loss of customer trust, and legal liabilities. HP aims to change that.\nAs part of its plan, HP will focus on developing encryption solutions that are easy to deploy, manage, and use. The company plans to leverage its expertise in hardware and software to offer integrated encryption solutions that meet the unique needs of different industries and organizations.\nHP will also collaborate with leading e-commerce platforms, payment processors, and financial institutions to promote the use of encryption technology. This will include offering incentives and discounts for businesses that adopt encryption solutions and sharing best practices for secure online commerce.\nThe plan also includes a major marketing campaign to raise awareness about the importance of encryption and the value of HP's encryption technology solutions. The campaign will target businesses, consumers, and government agencies.\n\"We believe that encryption technology is essential for building trust and confidence in online transactions,\" said Westervelt. \"We are committed to helping our customers stay ahead of the curve when it comes to cybersecurity and ensuring that their data is protected at all times.\"\nThe announcement of HP's plan to boost sales of encryption technology has been welcomed by cybersecurity experts and industry insiders. They see it as a positive step towards promoting online security and reducing the risks of cybercrime.\nIn conclusion, encryption technology is essential for protecting sensitive data online, and HP's plan to boost sales of encryption solutions is a timely and necessary initiative. By investing in research and development, expanding marketing efforts, and partnering with industry players, HP is well-positioned to lead the way in secure online commerce.", "China is gearing up to increase its refining capacity and ethylene production to meet the ever-rising demand for energy. According to the country's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China has set ambitious targets for 2021 to expand its refining capacity and ethylene production to support economic growth.\nIn recent years, China's energy demand has soared, driven by the country's rapid industrialization and urbanization. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China has become the world's largest consumer of energy, accounting for 24% of global energy consumption in 2019. The country's appetite for energy is expected to continue to grow as it shifts towards a more consumer-driven economy.\nTo meet this demand, China plans to build several new oil refineries and expand a number of existing ones. In March 2021, the NDRC approved four new refinery projects worth a total investment of 50.7 billion yuan ($7.7 billion). These projects are expected to add 29.8 million tons of crude oil processing capacity per year.\nAdditionally, China plans to upgrade its existing refineries to increase their efficiency and reduce emissions. The country's top three oil companies, Sinopec, PetroChina, and CNOOC, have announced plans to invest a total of 119.3 billion yuan ($18.3 billion) in upgrading their refineries in 2021.\nCNOOC, China's largest offshore oil and gas producer, has said that it plans to increase its crude oil processing capacity by 26% by 2025. The company aims to do this by building four new plants and expanding four existing ones.\nAt the same time, China also plans to boost its production of ethylene, a key chemical used in the manufacture of plastics, textiles, and other products. According to the NDRC, China aims to increase its ethylene production capacity to 45 million tons per year by 2025, up from 38 million tons in 2020.\nThis plan will involve the construction of several new ethylene plants and the expansion of existing ones. In March 2021, Sinochem Energy, a subsidiary of state-owned Sinochem Group, announced plans to build a new ethylene plant in East China's Zhejiang province. The plant is expected to have an annual production capacity of 1.2 million tons of ethylene.\nThe expansion of China's refining capacity and ethylene production will have significant economic implications. China is the world's largest importer of crude oil, and the expansion of its refining capacity will help to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. The increased production of ethylene will also support China's manufacturing industry, which has become a key driver of the country's economic growth.\nAt the same time, however, the expansion of China's energy sector will also have environmental consequences. The country's air and water pollution levels are already among the highest in the world, and the production of fossil fuels and chemicals is a major contributor to this pollution.\nTo address these concerns, China has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and shift towards cleaner forms of energy. The country aims to reach peak emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. To achieve these goals, China will need to continue to invest in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, as well as carbon capture and storage technology.\nIn conclusion, China's plans to increase its refining capacity and ethylene production reflect the country's continued economic expansion and its growing energy demand. However, the expansion of the energy sector also presents significant environmental challenges. To address these challenges, China will need to balance its energy needs with its commitments to reduce emissions and promote cleaner forms of energy.", "Japan's real estate giant Sueno Kosan, known for its upscale apartment complexes, hotels, and resorts, is on the brink of bankruptcy with a whopping $5.5 billion in liabilities. With its assets unable to cover the substantial debt, industry experts are speculating a potential restructuring or sale of the company.\nReports revealed that over the past few years, the company has been struggling with mounting debts, declining revenues, and several failed projects. The prolonged economic stagnation, falling property prices, and a demographic shift of aging population have driven the company into financial turmoil.\nAccording to industry insiders, Sueno Kosan has been facing increasing pressure from creditors, including banks, bondholders, and vendors, to pay off their outstanding debts. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the company has also been hit hard by travel restrictions and dwindling tourism, causing a significant drop in hotel and resort bookings.\nMoreover, Sueno Kosan's sprawling real estate portfolio, worth over 107 billion yen ($981 million), has been criticized for being too diversified, making it difficult for the company to focus on profitable projects and manage its finances efficiently.\nAs a result, the company has been trying to restructure its operations, cut costs, and renegotiate its debts. However, despite selling off several assets, including apartments and hotels, the company\u2019s liabilities continue to spiral out of control.\nWhile the company has yet to declare bankruptcy formally, analysts believe that it is only a matter of time before the firm files for insolvency. If that happens, Sueno Kosan would be the biggest real estate company\u2019s bankruptcy in Japan since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nThe collapse of Sueno Kosan would also have a significant impact on the Japanese real estate market, which has already been grappling with rising vacancies, slow sales, and a lack of construction projects. With Sueno Kosan's inventory flooding the market, it could lead to further price declines, especially in the luxury segment, where the company has a stronghold market presence.\nThe news of Sueno Kosan's possible bankruptcy has sent shockwaves across the country's business landscape, with investors, employees, and customers concerned about the future of the company. Many are hoping that the company can turn its fortunes around with a major debt restructuring plan or a change in management.\nHowever, experts caution that the real estate market may not recover anytime soon, given the country's sluggish growth and uncertain economic outlook. The pandemic's impact has also shifted the consumers\u2019 preference towards properties outside of major cities, impacting Sueno Kosan's high-end properties in Tokyo, Osaka, and other metropolitan areas.\nFor Sueno Kosan's 2,600 employees, the prospect of bankruptcy could spell job losses and financial hardship. However, the company's management has a responsibility to ensure that its stakeholders are protected from the fallout.\nMany commentators believe that Sueno Kosan's problems are not unique to the real estate industry, with many other companies in Japan struggling with similar challenges. The pandemic's impact has highlighted that many firms may not be viable in the new normal, with technological disruption and changing consumer preferences leading to a shift in business models.\nIn conclusion, Sueno Kosan's potential bankruptcy is a sobering reminder of the fragility of even the most prominent companies in Japan's real estate sector. The company's struggles reflect the broader economic challenges facing Japan and could serve as a wake-up call for policymakers to take bold initiatives to stimulate growth and create more sustainable business models.", "AT&T Chairman Robert Allen Likely to Step Down Early in Search for Successor.\nAfter serving as Chairman for the telecom giant AT&T for nearly six years, Robert Allen is preparing to step down. Sources familiar with the matter have informed us that Allen's early exit is linked to the ongoing search for his successor at the top of the company\u2019s executive hierarchy.\nAT&T is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the US and has operations worldwide. The company provides wireless, TV, and internet services, and is currently working on the deployment of its next-generation 5G wireless network. It has an annual revenue of over $160 billion and employs about 230,000 people. Allen\u2019s decision to step down could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s future.\nAllen\u2019s resignation has not yet been officially announced, but rumors are already circulating throughout the industry. Sources say that AT&T\u2019s board has been searching for Allen\u2019s successor for a few months now, and that a shortlist of potential candidates has already been created.\nThe list of potential successors includes several high-profile executives from the tech, media, and telecom industries. The top candidates reportedly include John Stankey, currently the CEO of WarnerMedia, and Jeff McElfresh, the head of AT&T's communications division. Other names that have been mentioned are Brian Lesser, the former CEO of advertising firm GroupM, and Tom Rutledge, the CEO of Charter Communications.\nWhoever takes over from Allen will face a daunting task. AT&T's primary focus is on the deployment of a nationwide 5G network, which requires significant investment and expertise. The company has also been facing challenges related to its media assets. In 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner for a whopping $85.4 billion, a move that was supposed to help the company compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. However, the acquisition has not been as successful as expected, with the company struggling to find the right formula to integrate its WarnerMedia properties into its overall business strategy.\nMoreover, the company is grappling with a legal challenge from the US Department of Justice, which is trying to block the Time Warner acquisition on antitrust grounds. AT&T has disputed the DOJ's allegations, arguing that the acquisition will benefit consumers, but the case is still ongoing.\nAs Allen prepares to step down, he can look back on a career that has seen him serve in leadership positions at some of the world\u2019s largest companies. Before joining AT&T, Allen was the CEO of AT&T spin-off Lucent Technologies, and before that, he held positions at both AT&T and Bell Laboratories. He is widely respected in the industry for his vision and leadership skills. During his tenure at AT&T, Allen focused on expanding the company's wireless network and investing in new technologies like 5G.\nWhile Allen's departure may cause some uncertainty at AT&T, the search for his successor presents an opportunity for the company to bring in new talent and ideas. The next Chairman will need to be someone with a deep understanding of the telecom and media industries, as well as strong leadership skills and a solid track record of success.\nDespite the challenges facing the company, AT&T is still a profitable and influential player in the telecom industry. It has a large customer base and a diverse portfolio of services, including wireless, internet, and TV. The company is also positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for data and connectivity, which is expected to grow as more devices become connected to the internet.\nIt remains to be seen who will take over from Allen at AT&T, but the search for his successor is well underway. As the telecom industry continues to evolve and change, it's essential that AT&T has the right person at the helm to guide it through the challenges ahead. Allen's successor will have big shoes to fill, but if AT&T can find the right person, the company will be well-positioned to thrive in the years ahead.", "Toronto, CA - Canada's six largest banks - Royal Bank of Canada, TD Bank Group, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada - are all expected to report robust profits for the third quarter of 2021, underscoring the strong recovery of the Canadian economy from the pandemic.\nExperts and analysts predict that the banks will collectively post earnings of CAD 15.9 billion, a 38% surge from the same period last year. The upswing in profits is due to the increased adoption of online banking, a jump in credit card spending, and reduced provisions for loan losses as many customers are able to repay loans on time, reflecting the improving economic outlook.\nEarlier this month, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 0.5%, signaling its confidence in the economy's strength and resilience. As such, the banks are also expected to benefit from higher net interest margins, which is the difference between the interest rate banks charge for loans and the rate they pay on deposits.\n\"The way the banks adapted to the pandemic and digitized their services has paid off in many ways, and we're seeing that reflected in their financial results,\" said Ken Wong, a marketing professor at Queen's University. \"There's definitely a pent-up demand for spending and the banks are in a prime position to capitalize on that.\"\nRoyal Bank of Canada, the country's largest lender by market value, is expected to report earnings of CAD 3.9 billion, up 36% from last year. The bank's strength in its wealth management and capital markets divisions will offset slower growth in its personal and commercial banking operations. Similarly, TD Bank Group is projected to report strong earnings of CAD 3.2 billion, up 50% from last year, as its U.S. retail banking division shows significant growth.\nScotiabank, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada are also expected to post impressive gains year-over-year. Scotiabank will likely report earnings of CAD 2.4 billion, up 53%, due to its expansion in Latin America and higher trading revenues. Bank of Montreal is expected to report earnings of CAD 2.2 billion, up 23%, driven by its strong commercial banking and wealth management businesses. CIBC's earnings are expected to be CAD 1.8 billion, up 33%, thanks to the bank's strong mortgage lending segment. National Bank of Canada is expected to report earnings of CAD 1 billion, a gain of 47%, as its retail and wealth management operations continue to drive growth.\nThe strong financial results for the Big Six banks will help boost investor confidence in the Canadian financial sector and the overall economy. The Canadian banking system, which has long been touted as one of the strongest and most stable in the world, has played a significant role in supporting the country's economic growth.\n\"Canada's banking system is one of the most resilient in the world, and the banks have shown time and again that they can adapt to changing market conditions,\" said Wong. \"It's no surprise that they're doing well in this quarter, and they will continue to be a driving force behind Canada's recovery from the pandemic.\"\nDespite the positive outlook for the banks, there are some potential challenges on the horizon. The ongoing global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures could impact consumer spending, and rising interest rates could put pressure on highly indebted households. The labour market recovery is also uneven, and the pandemic continues to pose risks to the health and well-being of Canadians.\n\"Although the banks are well-positioned to weather any headwinds, there are still uncertainties in the market that could impact their bottom line,\" warned Wong. \"We'll have to wait and see how the rest of the year plays out, but for now, the Canadian banking sector is looking strong and resilient.\"", "London, UK \u2013 Analysts are saying that an attempt to block the merger of British Telecom (BT) and MCI on the grounds of restricted trade is highly unlikely to succeed.\nThe possible merger, which was announced earlier this year, would see BT acquire MCI, the biggest supplier of voice and data communication solutions globally. With the proposed acquisition mostly focusing on MCI's international business markets, some critics have expressed concern that the merged entity would hold too much market power and therefore breach trade regulations.\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that there have been several mergers in the telecoms sector in recent years, including the merger of Vodafone and Mannesmann, BT\u2019s acquisition of EE, and Deutsche Telekom's acquisition of US mobile network operator Sprint. These mergers have not had any significant impact on the competitive landscape and did not pose any threat to trade regulations.\nAdditionally, the proposed merger between BT and MCI does not involve a significant overlap in their businesses. MCI focuses primarily on business-to-business solutions, while BT\u2019s focus is on consumer and business-to-business offerings. The deal would help BT to expand its global presence, in turn enhancing its competitiveness and potentially leading to lower prices for consumers.\nFurthermore, the global telecoms market is becoming increasingly competitive, with new players entering the market and existing players constantly innovating to stay ahead. This competition makes it challenging for any one company to monopolize the market.\nSome critics have raised concerns that a merged BT-MCI could withhold its network infrastructure from competitors, denying them access to key infrastructure. However, such concerns can be mitigated by regulating access to critical infrastructure through government involvement.\nSpeaking on this issue, Michael Powell, a former chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission, said, \u201cThe hype about how they will control all the network infrastructure or data centers and limit the access of others is vastly overstated. The global telecoms market is too intense and diverse for one company to create a stranglehold, no matter how much market power they have in some areas.\u201d\nIt is expected that the merger will face scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the US and Europe, but analysts believe that regulators are unlikely to block the merger on trade restriction grounds, citing a lack of evidence to support such a claim.\nThe proposed merger is still subject to approval, and its impact on competition and regulation will need to be assessed. If approved, the merger between BT and MCI is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.", "In a 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court has denied a request to reactivate landmark rules designed to open up local phone markets to competition. The decision came in response to a petition filed by a group of states and public interest organizations, who argued that the rules were necessary to promote competition and protect consumers.\nThe rules in question were originally adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1996, as part of the Telecommunications Act of that year. The regulations required incumbent telephone companies, such as AT&T and Verizon, to open their local networks to other providers, allowing consumers to choose between multiple providers for their local phone service.\nThe rules were seen as a major victory for advocates of competition and consumer choice, and were credited with spurring a wave of innovation and investment in new phone services, such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP) and mobile phones.\nHowever, in 2005, the FCC voted to deregulate the local phone market, eliminating many of the regulations designed to promote competition. The move was heavily criticized by consumer advocates and some members of Congress, who argued that it would lead to higher prices and poorer service for consumers.\nSince then, a number of states and public interest organizations have attempted to reintroduce the original rules, arguing that they are necessary to protect consumers and promote competition. In 2015, the FCC adopted new rules that attempted to restore some of the original regulations, but those rules were ultimately struck down by a federal appeals court in 2016.\nThe petitioners in the current case argued that the Supreme Court should step in and reactivate the original rules, citing the importance of promoting competition and consumer choice. They pointed to evidence that suggests that deregulating the local phone market has led to higher prices and lower quality of service for consumers.\nHowever, in its decision, the Supreme Court sided with the FCC, arguing that the agency had the authority to deregulate the local phone market as it saw fit. The court reiterated its longstanding deference to federal agencies in matters of regulatory policy, and rejected the petitioners' arguments that the FCC's decision was arbitrary and capricious.\nThe decision drew swift condemnation from consumer advocates and some members of Congress, who argued that it represented a major setback for competition and consumer choice. They vowed to continue fighting for policies that promote competition and protect consumers in the telecommunications sector.\n\"This decision is a blow to competition and consumer choice,\" said John Bergmayer, Senior Counsel at Public Knowledge, a public interest group that was among the petitioners. \"We will continue to fight for policies that ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, reliable phone service.\"\nSome analysts, however, argued that the decision was a victory for the telecommunications industry, which had lobbied heavily for the deregulation of the local phone market. They predicted that the decision would pave the way for further deregulation in the sector, and could lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers in the long run.\n\"While this decision may be disappointing for those who support competition and consumer choice, it's a major win for the telecommunications industry,\" said David Balto, a former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission. \"We can expect to see further deregulation in this sector, which could lead to higher prices and less choice for consumers.\"\nThe Supreme Court's decision represents the latest chapter in a long-running debate over the regulation of the telecommunications industry. While advocates of deregulation argue that it promotes competition and innovation, critics argue that it can lead to market consolidation and higher prices for consumers. The debate is likely to continue for years to come, as policymakers and regulators grapple with the challenges of promoting competition and protecting consumers in a rapidly evolving industry.", "In a move that has sent shockwaves across the financial world, Sir Chippendale Keswick has taken over as the chairman and CEO of Hambros, ending the historic family dominance of the renowned banking institution.\nThe handover of power marks an end to the Keswick family's 170-year-long grip on the company, which was founded in 1839 by Sir Charles Hambro. The family has been synonymous with the bank since 1865, when Sir Charles' son-in-law, William Keswick, joined the board of directors.\nBut now, after much speculation and anticipation, Sir Chippendale Keswick has taken the reins of the company, inheriting the mantle of leadership that has passed down through his family for generations.\nSir Chippendale, who served as deputy chairman of Hambros prior to his appointment, brings with him a wealth of experience and expertise in the banking sector. He has been with the bank for over 20 years, and has previously worked at other prestigious institutions such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.\nHis appointment has been met with widespread praise from industry insiders, who believe he has the skillset and temperament needed to lead the company into a new era of growth and prosperity.\nSpeaking to reporters about his new role, Sir Chippendale said: \"I am deeply honored to have been chosen to lead Hambros, and I am committed to upholding the legacy of the Keswick and Hambro families. I believe that with the right strategy and approach, we can navigate the current economic climate and emerge stronger than ever.\"\nThe appointment of Sir Chippendale marks a significant shift for the company, which has faced significant challenges in recent years. In 2008, the bank was acquired by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, a move that was met with some resistance from members of the Keswick family.\nBut despite this, Hambros has continued to thrive, and has remained a key player in the global banking sector. And now, with Sir Chippendale at the helm, the company is poised to continue this legacy of success and growth.\nThe breaking of the family dominance at Hambros has been a topic of much debate and discussion, with many arguing that it was time for fresh leadership and new ideas to take the company forward.\nBut despite this, the Keswick family will remain a key part of the bank's history, and their contributions to the institution will continue to be celebrated for generations to come.", "ANZ, the Australian banking group, has denied rumors that it was investigating a potential merger with Standard Chartered, the UK-listed international banking and financial services company with operations in Asia and Africa. The $24 billion merger rumors had been circulating in recent days on social media and in some financial news outlets.\nANZ has issued a statement denying any such plans. The statement said that the rumors were baseless and unsubstantiated, and that ANZ was not currently investigating a merger with Standard Chartered. ANZ also said that it was committed to its current strategy and had no plans to pursue any major acquisitions or mergers.\nThe rumors had caused a spike in Standard Chartered's stock price, with some investors speculating that a merger with ANZ could create a major player in the global banking industry. ANZ's share price also rose slightly, while some analysts and experts had expressed skepticism about the feasibility of such a merger.\nANZ is one of the largest banks in Australia and New Zealand, with a history dating back over 180 years. It has a strong presence in the Asia-Pacific region and has been expanding its operations and services in recent years. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, has a long history of operations in Asia and Africa, and has been seeking to diversify its business and improve its profitability in recent years.\nThe global banking industry has been undergoing significant changes and challenges in recent years, with increased competition, regulatory requirements, and technological disruption. Some analysts have suggested that mergers and acquisitions may be a solution for some banks to achieve scale, efficiency, and growth in a challenging environment. However, others have warned of the risks and complexities involved in such deals, including cultural differences, regulatory hurdles, and integration challenges.\nANZ's denial of the merger rumors may put an end to the speculation, at least for now. However, the news highlights the interest and attention that major banks and investors have in strategic partnerships and deals, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Some experts predict that further consolidation and partnerships may occur in the future, as banks seek to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.\nThe news may also have implications for the stock prices and investor sentiment of ANZ and Standard Chartered, as well as for other banks and financial institutions.

The Beijing-based company has stated its goal of having 70% of its profit coming from financial services in the next few years.\nCITIC Corp, which originally started out as an investment arm of the Chinese government and later diversified into various sectors such as energy, real estate, and infrastructure, has struggled to keep up with rising competition in recent years. In 2019, the group's total profit fell by 44%, causing major concerns for the company.\nHowever, CITIC's current move to streamline its businesses and focus on improving its financial services could help the conglomerate reposition itself and overcome the difficulties it has been facing. The company has already made significant progress in the financial sector, with its two main arms, CITIC Securities and CITIC Bank, achieving phenomenal growth in recent years. \nCITIC Securities, the country's leading securities firm, reported a net profit of 24.5 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) in 2019. Its strong performance was mainly due to the steady increase in trading commissions, stable brokerage fees, and growth in asset management business. CITIC Bank, on the other hand, saw its net profit rise by 5.9% to 59.9 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) last year, thanks to higher retail banking revenue and interest income.\nCITIC Corp's Chairman, Zhao Yiming, stated that the company's shift to the financial sector would involve a \"three-step\" process that includes streamlining its operations, investing in technology, and expanding its financial services. The company will also focus on innovation and the development of new fintech products to stay ahead of the competition.\nThe company plans to boost its wealth management business and expand its offering of asset management services for both individual and institutional clients. It is also looking to leverage its extensive network and expertise in China's real estate market to provide new mortgage products.\nCITIC Corp's move to focus on the financial sector aligns with the Chinese government's push to create a more dynamic and efficient financial market and reduce the overreliance on traditional banks. The move also comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions in the global economy, leading investors to seek safe-haven assets and higher returns.\nIn conclusion, CITIC Corp's shift to the financial sector is aimed at addressing the challenges that the company has faced in recent years. The conglomerate's focus on innovation, expanding its financial services, and promoting digitization is expected to enhance its profitability, and provide new sources of revenue in the coming years. The move also aligns with China's ambition of creating a more dynamic and efficient financial market, which is well-positioned to weather future economic shocks.", "London, UK - In an announcement made by the CEO of Grand Metropolitan Plc, the company has revealed that it will be focusing on cost-cutting measures by distancing itself from production. The move comes as Grand Metropolitan Plc seeks to improve profitability and streamline operations following a tough year for the global economy.\n\"We have decided to unshackle ourselves from the production process,\" said CEO, John Smith. \"By doing this, we will be able to focus on cost-cutting and streamline our operations to become more efficient.\"\nThe announcement has come as no surprise to industry analysts, who have noted a significant trend towards outsourcing and offshoring in recent years. This move will allow Grand Metropolitan Plc to focus on its core business areas, such as marketing and sales, without the added burden of managing production.\nThe decision has also been welcomed by shareholders, who are keen for the company to improve its profitability. Grand Metropolitan Plc has struggled in recent years, with revenue and profits declining amidst tough competition and economic uncertainty.\n\"We believe that this move will help us become more agile and responsive to market changes,\" added John Smith. \"Our focus will now be on creating value for our shareholders by improving efficiency and reducing costs.\"\nAs part of the cost-cutting initiative, Grand Metropolitan Plc will be reviewing its supply chain and logistics operations. The company is expected to consider outsourcing some of these functions to third-party providers to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\n\"By outsourcing non-core activities, we will be able to free up resources to focus on our core business areas,\" commented the CEO. \"We believe that this will enable us to better serve our customers and deliver long-term value for our investors.\"\nThe move is also expected to result in redundancies, as the company looks to reduce its workforce in line with the cost-cutting initiative. However, John Smith has assured employees that the company will do everything it can to support them during this transition.\n\"We recognise that this is a difficult time for our employees and their families,\" said John Smith. \"We are committed to treating our employees with respect and dignity and will be providing support and assistance to those affected by the changes.\"\nThe decision by Grand Metropolitan Plc to unshackle itself from production is part of a wider trend towards outsourcing and offshoring. As companies look to reduce costs and improve efficiency, many are turning to third-party providers to manage non-core functions, enabling them to focus on their core business areas.\nThe move is also expected to result in increased competition as more companies adopt similar cost-cutting measures. However, Grand Metropolitan Plc is confident that its focus on marketing and sales will enable it to remain competitive and continue to deliver long-term value for its shareholders.", "Austin Reed, the British fashion retailer, has seen a significant boost in its profits and sales since its women executives returned to favour.

Despite this setback, Murdoch remains optimistic about the company\u2019s future earnings and is still aiming for a 20% profit rise in the 1996/97 fiscal year.\nThe company\u2019s net income for the quarter fell by 16.8% to $161 million, down from $193 million in the same period last year. Revenue increased slightly by 2.5% to $5.27 billion, but fell short of expectations. This drop in profit was mainly attributed to weaker advertising revenue from News Corp\u2019s television channels, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom.\nMurdoch is unfazed by these results, however. He believes that News Corp is still on track to achieve its goals for the current fiscal year. \u201cWhile our Q1 results were lower than expected, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our targets for the full year,\u201d said Murdoch in a statement.\nOne of the ways News Corp plans to achieve its 20% profit increase is by expanding its digital and streaming services. This includes its recently-launched streaming service, Binge, in Australia, and its stake in the US streaming platform, Hulu. The company also plans to invest in other areas, such as augmented reality and virtual reality.\n\u201cWe are optimistic about our future growth prospects, particularly in the digital and streaming space,\u201d said Murdoch. \u201cWe are committed to investing in these areas and developing innovative new products and services for our customers.\u201d\nAnother area of focus for News Corp is its publishing division, which includes newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Times in the UK. While revenue from newspapers has been declining in recent years, Murdoch believes they still have value and can drive profits for the company. The Times, for example, recently announced plans to expand its digital presence with a new subscription-based news service.\n\u201cThere is still a place for quality journalism in today\u2019s world, and we believe our newspapers can continue to be profitable,\u201d said Murdoch. \u201cWe are committed to investing in this area and finding new ways to monetize our content.\u201d\nDespite the lower than expected Q1 results, News Corp\u2019s shares have remained relatively steady, only falling slightly after the earnings report was released. This suggests that investors are still confident in the company\u2019s long-term prospects.\nIn conclusion, while News Corp\u2019s Q1 results were disappointing, Rupert Murdoch remains bullish about the company\u2019s future prospects. With a focus on expanding its digital and streaming services and investing in its publishing division, News Corp is still aiming for a 20% profit increase in the current fiscal year.

Boral, which is one of Australia's largest companies, reported a net loss of $29.5 million for the first quarter of the year, compared with a net profit of $2.3 million for the same period last year.\nThe poor performance was largely due to the weak Australian housing market, which has been hit hard by rising interest rates and a slowdown in the economy. Boral's earnings from its building materials division, which includes its bricks and roofing products, were down by 21% compared with the same period last year.\nBoral's Chief Executive, Rod Pearse, said that the poor performance was disappointing but not unexpected given the difficult economic conditions. \"We have been expecting a tough start to the year, and the results reflect the challenges that we are facing in the Australian market,\" he said.\nPearse said that Boral had taken steps to cut costs and improve efficiency in response to the challenging market conditions. \"We have already implemented a number of cost-cutting measures, including reducing our headcount and streamlining our operations, to ensure that we are well positioned to weather the current economic climate,\" he said.\nDespite the poor start to the year, Pearse said that he remained optimistic about Boral's long-term prospects. \"We are confident that we have the right strategy in place to deliver sustainable growth over the long-term, and we remain committed to investing in our business to ensure that we continue to deliver value to our shareholders,\" he said.\nAnalysts said that the weak housing market was likely to continue to weigh on Boral's earnings in the short-term. \"The Australian housing market is one of the main drivers of Boral's earnings, so any weakness in that market is going to have a significant impact on the company's bottom line,\" said Johnathan Mott, an analyst at UBS.\nMott said that Boral's strategy of cutting costs and improving efficiency was a sensible one given the current economic climate. \"Boral needs to focus on improving its productivity and reducing its costs in order to remain competitive in what is a very challenging market,\" he said.\nHowever, Mott said that Boral would also need to focus on diversifying its operations if it wanted to reduce its dependence on the housing market. \"Boral has a strong position in the building materials market, but it needs to start looking at other industries if it wants to reduce its exposure to the housing market,\" he said.\nBoral has already taken steps to diversify its operations, with the company recently acquiring US-based Headwaters Inc, a supplier of building materials to the construction industry. The acquisition, which was completed in January this year, is expected to help boost Boral's earnings by providing it with a foothold in the North American building materials market.\nPearse said that the acquisition of Headwaters was part of Boral's strategy to diversify its operations and reduce its dependence on the Australian housing market. \"The acquisition of Headwaters is a significant step in our strategy of diversifying our operations and expanding our footprint in key global markets,\" he said.\nBoral's shares have fallen by around 20% this year, and the company has warned that its earnings for the full year are likely to be lower than previously expected due to the weak Australian housing market.\nDespite the challenges that the company is facing, Pearse said that he remained confident about the future of Boral. \"We have a strong business with a great track record, and we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in our industry,\" he said. \"We are confident that we will be able to deliver sustainable growth over the long-term and continue to provide value to our shareholders.\"", "In a bid to take its basketball game to the next level, China has launched a new basketball league that features American coaches and players.

It is a joint venture between the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and a consortium of American investors.\nThe CBAA will feature six teams, each with four American players and one American coach.

The two executives, Louis Ross and Anne Stevens, have been appointed as group vice presidents and will have expanded responsibilities within the company.\nLouis Ross, currently the president of Ford Credit, will take on the role of group vice president of North America Marketing, Sales and Service. In his new role, Ross will oversee Ford's efforts to improve sales and market share in North America, including the launch of new products and innovations in customer service.\nAnne Stevens, currently the executive vice president of Ford's automotive operations in Europe, will become group vice president of North America Vehicle Operations. In this role, Stevens will be responsible for all aspects of North American vehicle manufacturing, from engineering to production.\nThe promotions come as Ford looks to position itself for success in an increasingly competitive global market. Under Trotman's leadership, the company has made significant strides in improving its financial performance and expanding into new markets. However, the company faces a number of challenges, including mounting competition from foreign automakers, changing consumer preferences, and regulatory pressures related to environmental concerns.\nIn a statement announcing the promotions, Trotman praised both Ross and Stevens for their dedication and proven track records of success within the company. \"I have worked closely with both Louis and Anne for many years, and I am confident that they have the skills and experience necessary to help lead Ford to continued success in the years ahead,\" Trotman said.\nThe promotions also highlight the ongoing race to succeed Trotman, who is scheduled to retire next year. While Ford has not yet announced an official successor to Trotman, insiders say that both Ross and Stevens are considered top candidates for the position.\nRoss, who has been with Ford for over 30 years, has held a variety of leadership positions within the company, including serving as the president of Ford Mexico and leading the company's global marketing efforts. Stevens, who joined Ford in 1992, has held senior leadership roles in both Europe and North America, including leading the successful turnaround of Ford's European operations in the early 2000s.\nWhoever succeeds Trotman will inherit a company that is still largely dependent on the North American market, despite recent efforts to expand into new regions. While Ford has made significant investments in electric and autonomous vehicle technology, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be enough to stay competitive over the long term.\nIn recent years, Ford has faced criticism from some investors who believe that the company has been slow to adapt to changing market conditions. However, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects and has vowed to continue investing in new technologies and expanding into new markets.\n\"With Louis and Anne on board, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead,\" Trotman said. \"I am confident that our team has what it takes to build a stronger, more innovative Ford for the future.\"", "Wolseley Plc, a British multinational distributor of heating, plumbing, and building materials, has recently reported a 1% dip in its yearly pretax profits, despite an increase in sales and dividend raises. The news comes amidst a poor outlook for mainland Europe shares, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the global economy.\nAccording to the company's latest financial results, released on Wednesday, August 18th, Wolseley's pretax profits for the fiscal year that ended on July 31st amounted to \u00a31.03 billion, down from \u00a31.04 billion the previous year. The slight decline was attributed to rising costs related to the pandemic, as Wolseley stepped up safety measures and invested in digitalization to meet the surge in online orders.\nOn the positive side, the revenue of Wolseley increased by 3.4% to \u00a316.4 billion, driven by strong performances in the United States and the United Kingdom, which account for around 85% of the company's sales. This was also reflected in Wolseley's dividend payout to shareholders, which rose by 3.3% to 131.22 pence per share, signalling confidence in the company's future prospects.\nHowever, the overall sentiment around Wolseley's financials was dampened by the expected slowdown in European construction activity, particularly in Germany and France, where Wolseley has a significant presence. The company's CEO, Kevin Murphy, warned that the pandemic's impact on the European market is likely to linger, as the vaccination rates vary and supply chain disruptions persist.\n\"We're definitely seeing some softness in some of our European markets, particularly in Germany and France, where construction has been pretty disrupted,\" Murphy said. \"It's hard to call when we'll fully recover in those markets.\"\nMoreover, the investors seemed to be spooked by the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and the potential impact on Wolseley's supply chain, as the company imports around 40% of its products from continental Europe. The shares of Wolseley's parent company, Ferguson Plc, fell by 1.6% to 9,126 pence on the London Stock Exchange, amidst a broader sell-off of European equities.\nDespite the headwinds, Murphy remained optimistic about Wolseley's ability to weather the storm and emerge stronger in the long run. He noted the company's focus on innovation and digitalization, as well as its efforts to expand into new markets such as Australia and New Zealand.\n\"We're very focused on delivering the strategy that we set out, which is about growing market share, growing our online business, and consolidating our competitive advantage,\" Murphy said. \"We think we're well-positioned to do that in the current environment.\"\nOverall, Wolseley Plc's latest financial results reflect a mixed bag of achievements and challenges, as the company navigates through the pandemic's economic fallout. While the dip in profits is disappointing, the company's steady revenue growth and dividend raise demonstrate resilience and confidence in its core businesses. The poor outlook for mainland Europe shares and Brexit uncertainties serve as reminders that the road ahead is bumpy, but Wolseley remains committed to its long-term goals.", "Microsoft Responds to Threat of Network Computers with Push for Inexpensive, Easy-to-Use Personal Computers\nAs the buzz around network computers continues to grow, Microsoft Corporation has responded by doubling down on its efforts to create inexpensive and easy-to-use personal computers. In an effort to maintain its dominance in the marketplace, Microsoft is introducing a new line of personal computers that it believes will meet the needs of consumers who are looking for a simple way to connect to the internet and enjoy a wide range of applications and services.\nThe decision to focus on personal computers comes after companies like Oracle and Sun Microsystems have been touting the benefits of network computers for years. These lightweight machines, which rely on central servers to process and store data, are seen as the wave of the future by some analysts who believe that they will do away with the need for traditional desktop computers. However, Microsoft has consistently argued that consumers still want their own PCs and the company is betting that its latest offering will appeal to those who are looking for an affordable and straightforward way to access the internet.\nThe new line of personal computers, which will be called the Microsoft Home PC, will be priced between $500 and $700 and will be available in a variety of colors and styles. The computers will come equipped with a suite of Microsoft applications, including Office and Windows, as well as a host of other programs that will make it easy for users to browse the web, check their email, and connect to social media sites. Microsoft is hoping that the Home PC will be seen as a viable alternative to more expensive options like Apple's Mac or higher-end PCs.\nTo make the Home PC more accessible to consumers, Microsoft is also launching a new advertising campaign that is designed to showcase the computer\u2019s simplicity and ease-of-use. The ads, which will run on television and online, will feature actors and celebrities who will talk about their experiences using the new computer. Microsoft is hoping that the campaign will appeal to a wide range of people, from young adults who are just starting to explore the digital world to older consumers who may be intimidated by more complex machines.\n\"This is a new era for personal computing,\" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \"We believe that there will always be a need for PCs that are tailored to meet the needs of individual consumers, and that is what we are providing with the new Microsoft Home PC. We want to make it easy for everyone to get online and enjoy everything that the internet has to offer.\"\nThe decision to focus on personal computers may seem like a gamble in the rapidly changing tech industry, but Microsoft has a history of betting on its own products and services. The company has weathered challenges in the past, and its ability to adapt and evolve has allowed it to remain a leader in the software and technology space for decades.\nSome industry analysts are skeptical about Microsoft's move, arguing that network computers will eventually replace traditional PCs. However, others believe that there will always be a market for personal computers, especially among consumers who want more control over their devices. As the battle between network computers and traditional PCs continues to play out, it remains to be seen which side will come out on top.\nIn the meantime, Microsoft is committed to providing consumers with a compelling alternative to the network computer. The company is confident that its latest offering will appeal to users who want an affordable, feature-rich computer that is easy to use and looks great in their home or office. As the world becomes increasingly digital, Microsoft's efforts to stay relevant and stay ahead of the curve are likely to be closely watched by investors and consumers alike.", "China's latest pronouncement on freedom of expression in Hong Kong is worrying analysts, who fear that the Chinese government is slowly eroding the city's autonomy.\nOn Tuesday, China's top legislative body, the National People's Congress Standing Committee, announced that Hong Kong's lawmakers must swear allegiance to the city and the country, or else they will be disqualified. Critics say that the new requirement will effectively bar pro-democracy legislators from running for office.\nThe move comes after a wave of protests swept Hong Kong last year, with demonstrators calling for greater political freedom and an end to China's influence on the city. The Chinese government responded with a fierce crackdown, arresting protesters and passing a controversial new national security law that tightened Chinese control over Hong Kong.\nNow, with the new swearing-in requirement, analysts say that China is further eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and clamping down on dissent.\n\"The Chinese government's latest pronouncement on freedom of expression in Hong Kong is deeply troubling,\" said political analyst Lee Cheuk-yan. \"By imposing loyalty oaths on lawmakers, China is effectively silencing opposition voices and choking off the city's democratic institutions.\"\nCritics of the Chinese government have long accused it of seeking to end Hong Kong's autonomy and bring the city under its control. The new requirement for lawmakers is seen as a further step in that direction.\n\"The Chinese government has been steadily eroding Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms for years,\" said human rights activist Joshua Wong. \"This new requirement for lawmakers is just the latest example of China's attempts to silence dissent and tighten its grip on the city.\"\nHong Kong has traditionally enjoyed a high degree of autonomy from China, with a separate legal system and freedom of speech and assembly. However, concerns have been growing for years that China is seeking to undermine that autonomy and bring the city under its control.\nThe new requirement for lawmakers is seen as a particularly worrying development, as it effectively guarantees that only politicians who are loyal to China will be able to hold office in Hong Kong. This, in turn, could further stifle dissent and undermine Hong Kong's democratic institutions.\n\"The Chinese government's attempts to silence opposition voices are deeply concerning,\" said democracy activist Benny Tai. \"If Hong Kong is to have a free and open society, it must be able to have a diverse range of lawmakers who can express a variety of views and represent the interests of the city's citizens.\"\nIn response to the Chinese government's announcement, Hong Kong activists have vowed to continue their protests and fight for greater freedom and autonomy. However, many fear that China's increasing control over the city will make it increasingly difficult for them to do so.\n\"It's clear that China is intent on bringing Hong Kong under its control,\" said human rights advocate Emily Lau. \"But we cannot give up our fight for democracy and freedom. We must continue to speak out against China's actions and defend the values that make Hong Kong a unique and vibrant city.\"\nAs China continues to assert its authority over Hong Kong, the city's future as a hub of democracy and free speech is increasingly at risk. However, activists say that they are determined to keep fighting for their rights and freedoms, no matter what the Chinese government does.", "BAT Industries, one of the world's largest tobacco companies, has reported a nine percent increase in profits despite ongoing litigation in the United States. The company delivered strong results for the first half of 2021, with revenue up by four percent to \u00a312.18bn ($16.87bn), compared to the same period in 2020. Moreover, B.A.T Industries has decided not to demerge its business for now.\nThe company's profits from tobacco products increased by 9.6 percent, while profits from its next-generation products (NGP) increased by 50 percent to \u00a3758m ($1.05bn), which contributed to the overall rise in profit. The growth in NGP sales reflects the continued shift towards healthier alternatives to smoking, with products such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products gaining popularity among consumers.\nHowever, despite these positive results, B.A.T Industries continues to face challenges in the form of litigation and regulatory hurdles in the United States. The company has been hit with a series of lawsuits in recent years, accusing it of selling products that cause cancer and other health problems. The tobacco industry has long been a target for plaintiffs' lawyers, and B.A.T Industries is no exception.\nDespite these obstacles, the company remains confident about its future prospects. In a statement, CEO Jack Bowles said: \"We are pleased with our results for the first half of the year, which demonstrate the resilience of our business in challenging market conditions. Our focus on NGP and reduced-risk products is paying off, as we see continued growth in this area.\"\nThe company's decision not to pursue a demerger also reflects its confidence in its current business model. In recent years, there has been speculation that B.A.T Industries would split into two separate businesses, one focused on traditional tobacco products, and another on NGP. However, the company has now ruled out this possibility, stating that it believes it can achieve its goals more effectively with a unified business.\nBowles said, \"We have considered the potential benefits of a demerger carefully. However, we have concluded that such a move is not in the best interests of our shareholders at this time. We believe that we can create more value by focusing on our current strategy and continuing to drive growth across our entire business.\"\nB.A.T Industries' decision not to demerge has been well received in the financial community. The company's shares rose by 2.5 percent following the announcement, reflecting investors' confidence in the company's long-term prospects.\nDespite the positive news, B.A.T Industries faces significant challenges in the years ahead. The ongoing litigation and regulatory pressures will continue to impact its business, and the company will need to remain vigilant in managing these risks. Additionally, the tobacco market is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by changing consumer preferences and demands.\nThe rise of NGP and reduced-risk products presents significant opportunities for companies like B.A.T Industries. Still, it also poses a threat to their traditional business model. The company will need to continue innovating and investing in these products to remain competitive and capture the growing market.\nOverall, B.A.T Industries' strong financial performance in the first half of 2021 is a positive sign for the company. However, ongoing challenges in the form of litigation and regulatory hurdles, coupled with a changing market, mean that the company will need to remain vigilant and adaptable to succeed in the years ahead. Nevertheless, the company's commitment to its current business model and strategy is a positive sign and reflects a belief in its ability to navigate these challenges successfully.", "Manchester United\u2019s share price has soared over 10% following renewed speculation that the club could soon be subject to another bid for ownership. The club\u2019s shares, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, jumped to $19.39 on Monday, their highest level in over four years.\nReports suggest that the potential buyer is a US-based private equity firm, which has been linked with a number of high-profile sports acquisitions in recent years. Sources close to the matter have suggested that the firm has already been in talks with major shareholders at Manchester United, including the Glazer family, which owns a controlling stake in the club.\nThe speculation has been fueled in part by the ongoing financial difficulties faced by many soccer clubs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With revenues plunging across the board, many have been forced to seek new sources of funding in order to survive. For Manchester United, one of the richest and most successful clubs in the world, a takeover bid could represent an opportunity to secure fresh investment, enabling them to make strategic investments in players and infrastructure.\nHowever, any potential buyer is likely to face stiff opposition from fans of the club, many of whom view the Glazer family\u2019s ownership as detrimental to the team\u2019s fortunes. The family\u2019s acquisition of the club in 2005 was heavily leveraged, resulting in a large debt load that the club has struggled to pay down in the years since.\nIn recent years, fans have become increasingly vocal in their opposition to the Glazers, staging protests and even calling for the family to sell the club to new owners. Many see a private equity takeover as a continuation of the same corporate interests that have driven the Glazers\u2019 management of the club, and worry that the potential buyer would be similarly focused on profits rather than sporting success.\nDespite these concerns, however, the surge in Manchester United\u2019s share price demonstrates the level of interest that still exists in the club among investors. Whether or not a takeover bid materializes remains to be seen, but the renewed speculation is a reminder of the ongoing importance of soccer clubs as economic and cultural symbols.\nFor Manchester United, there may be difficult decisions to make in the coming months as they weigh up the potential benefits and risks of a takeover bid. But for fans of the club, one thing remains clear: the future of Manchester United is a matter of great importance, and any change in ownership will need to be carefully considered.", "Since the National Day celebrations in China, the country has been making significant moves to own the soybean and soymeal markets. The move has caused disruptions in the trade as the players are seeking practical ways to adjust.\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the soy and soymeal markets have always been significantly affected. China's relationship with the US has also complicated the issue further. In 2018, the US soybean market, which was the largest supplier to China, saw a decline in its market share due to the trade wars between the two nations.\nHowever, things seem to have taken a different turn this year after the National Day celebrations. China's agriculture sector has become increasingly assertive in the market since the holiday celebrations marking the 71st anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1.\nThe recent developments in China have caused jitters in the market, causing the US soybean futures market to show signs of weakness. The analysts are also monitoring the fluctuations in the Dalian exchange markets, where the Chinese government runs in futures.\nThe country's move to take over the soy and soymeal markets is due to various reasons. Firstly, it aims to create stronghold markets in essential sectors that are fundamental to food security. Secondly, China intends to fill in the void left by the US and Brazil, which have been facing constraints in production due to various factors.\nFor example, the US soybean producers have faced challenges related to productivity, climate change, and infrastructure, affecting their ability to meet the market's demand. On top of that, the US has been experiencing political instability, which has affected its bilateral relations with different countries, including China.\nDespite facing lower production capacity, Chinese demand for soybeans has been rising steadily since 2018. China's demand for soymeal is also on the rise, following the increased demand for meat products in the region. As such, China's shift to seize the soy and soymeal markets is driven by the country's need to safeguard its food security. Additionally, by owning the markets, China can reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers.\nChina has been taking steps to achieve these goals, which include increasing soybean production in various parts of the country, sourcing for new markets, and exploring new technologies to increase productivity. An example of this shift in focus can be seen in the expansion of the country's soybean acreage as well as its acquisition of farms in countries such as Ukraine, Brazil, and Argentina.\nThe government has also increased its support to soybean farmers, which has seen an increase in the yields of soybeans in the country. China's soy production has been rising over the last few years, with 2020 being the year when the country's soybean farmers have seen a significant boom.\nAnalysts posit that the move by China to seize the soy and soymeal markets could cause panic to other nations, leading them to restructure their soybean trade relations as well. The US, for example, may seek to explore new market shares or compete with China's domination of the market.\nSimilarly, the US may also consider rebuilding its bilateral relations with China to reduce its vulnerabilities in critical sectors such as transportation and infrastructure. Experts also suggest that the US might lobby for the relaxation of trade policies that limit its ability to trade with China.\nThe Chinese government's move towards domination of the soy and soymeal markets is not without its challenges. Despite its gains in filling the void left by the US, the country still faces constraints related to production capacity. Additionally, the erratic changes in market prices could hinder the country's gains in the market.\nIn conclusion, China's move to seize the soy and soymeal markets has caused disruptions in the global food trade. The country has been taking measures to attain self-sufficiency in the soy and soymeal markets, which is critical to its food security. The move has unsettled other global markets and could motivate other countries to make adjustments to their soybean trade. Moreover, this shift is likely to continue to affect the soy and soymeal markets in the foreseeable future.", "Czech Republic - The crowd was left stunned yesterday as Dutch tennis player Richard Krajicek was defeated in the first round of the Czech Indoor Open. Krajicek, who had been a heavy favorite to win the tournament, was knocked out in straight sets by unseeded French player, Xavier Malisse.\nThe first set was a closely fought battle, but it was Malisse who managed to edge ahead and secure a crucial break point at 5-4. Krajicek tried to level things up but Malisse held on to take the first set.\nThe second set saw Malisse continue his dominance. Krajicek struggled to find his rhythm as Malisse hit winner after winner to secure a 6-4, 6-3 victory and book his place in the second round of the tournament.\nSpeaking after the match, Krajicek admitted that he had not been at his best, \"I just wasn't there today,\" he said. \"Xavier played really well and deserved his win.\"\nMalisse, meanwhile, was overjoyed with his victory, \"Richard is a great player and I knew I had to play my best to beat him,\" he said. \"I'm very happy with the way I played and looking forward to the next round.\"\nThe Czech Indoor Open, which is being held at the O2 Arena in Prague, has attracted some of the biggest names in tennis. The tournament is a popular warm-up event for the upcoming Australian Open, which starts next month.\nThis shock defeat for Krajicek will no doubt come as a disappointment to his fans, who had been hoping to see him lift the trophy this year. However, the tournament is far from over and there are still plenty of talented players fighting for the title.", "Ivory Coast, the world's leading producer of cocoa, is also one of the largest coffee producers globally, and the industry has faced a lot of mixed fortunes over the years. Now, the industry is facing fresh uncertainties over returns as Caistab, the coffee regulatory board, implements market reforms.\nCaistab, in a bid to tackle years of low prices for coffee in the country that has nearly killed the industry, has opted to permit direct exports to roasters, a move that has been lauded by many in the industry. However, this decision also means that the board will lose its current monopoly, leaving growers to determine their prices with roasters directly.\nThis move is likely to cause significant disruptions in the industry, as farmers struggle to navigate the rough waters of pricing and marketing, with the unpredictable global coffee market only adding to the uncertainties.\nThe chair of Caistab, Dr. Gervais Coulibaly, acknowledges that this is a significant transition, requiring that both growers and exporters adjust to the new dynamics. \"We are witnessing the birth of a new era for coffee in Ivory Coast. However, it requires the full support and participation of everyone in the industry to succeed,\" he said.\nThe reforms present exciting opportunities for the coffee industry, including the chance for farmers to increase their earnings by selling directly to roasters while avoiding intermediaries and middlemen. That said, the move away from a board monopoly means that there will be no guarantee of minimum prices as in previous years.\nThere are also concerns that some farmers may undercut their prices, leading to a race to the bottom and low profitability for everyone involved. This is already happening in some regions, where some farmers and exporters are bypassing rules and regulations to offer beans at lower prices.\nFidele N'Zue Job, a senior coffee industry analyst, told reporters that the current situation would be challenging for many but highlighted that the new system might bring in some benefits in the long run. \"In the short term, there will be disruptions. In the long term, farmers will have access to better markets, more price transparency and therefore possibly better prices, \"he said.\nTo ensure a successful transition, Caistab has invested in capacity-building programs to empower farmers to negotiate better prices for their produce. The board has been training farmers on grading and quality control, and financial management while also working on introducing sustainable coffee farming practices.\nThe coffee industry in Ivory Coast is vital to the country's export earnings, and any changes made that negatively impact the sector could be disastrous. Therefore, all stakeholders in the industry must come together to ensure the reforms succeed without putting the livelihoods of farmers in jeopardy.", "Paris, France - The chairman of travel company Nouvelles Frontieres, Pascal Viguier, recently spoke about the company's decision to acquire troubled French airline AOM after dropping out of the Air Liberte deal.\nNouvelles Frontieres initially had its sights set on Air Liberte, but after negotiations fell through due to issues with the airline's debts and staff, the company shifted its focus to AOM.\nIn a statement released on Monday, Viguier stated that Nouvelles Frontieres had \"identified a number of strategic opportunities\" with AOM and believed the acquisition would benefit both companies.\n\"AOM has a strong presence in a number of key markets that are of interest to Nouvelles Frontieres, such as North and West Africa, the Caribbean, and Reunion Island,\" said Viguier. \"We believe that by combining our strengths, we can create a stronger, more competitive entity that offers a wider range of travel options to customers.\"\nThe acquisition of AOM would come at a critical time for the airline, which has been struggling to stay afloat amid fierce competition and mounting debts. In recent months, AOM has been forced to cancel a number of flights due to financial difficulties, leaving thousands of passengers stranded and causing widespread frustration.\nViguier acknowledged the challenges facing AOM but expressed confidence in the airline's ability to turn things around.\n\"We understand that AOM has been going through a difficult period recently, but we believe that with our support and expertise, the airline can rebound and regain its position as a leading player in the French aviation market,\" he said.\nThe acquisition of AOM would be a major coup for Nouvelles Frontieres, which has been aggressively expanding its presence in the travel industry in recent years. The company has made a number of strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including the purchase of Belgium-based travel company Thomas Cook and a joint venture with Spanish hotel chain Melia.\nViguier emphasized that Nouvelles Frontieres' focus on growth and innovation would continue, with the company remaining committed to providing high-quality travel experiences for its customers.\n\"We're constantly looking for new ways to improve and evolve our business, whether it's through strategic partnerships, innovative technologies, or a continued focus on customer satisfaction,\" he said. \"We believe that the acquisition of AOM is a significant step forward for us, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\"\nThe acquisition of AOM is still subject to regulatory approval and is expected to take several months to complete. However, Viguier and the rest of the Nouvelles Frontieres team are optimistic about the outcome and are confident that the deal will ultimately be successful.\n\"We're committed to making this acquisition work and ensuring that both our companies are stronger and more successful together than they would be apart,\" said Viguier. \"We believe that the future of the travel industry is bright, and we're excited to be a part of it.\"", "China has recently announced a significant purchase of soybean oil, but traders in Asia are skeptical about the country's stated intentions. The skepticism is fueled by concerns about the country's ability to absorb large volumes of the commodity and the possibility of an overreaction in the markets.\nThe acquisition of soybean oil by China is part of a broader strategy to augment the nation's food security. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, China realized that its dependence on imports made it vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. As a result, the country began to purchase more agricultural commodities, such as soybeans and meat, to bolster its reserves.\nHowever, the news of China buying soybean oil has not led to a surge in demand in the Asian markets. Instead, traders are wary of the country's ability to consume large amounts of the commodity. Furthermore, some are concerned that the news might have been leaked to deceive the markets, leading to a price increase in soybean oil.\nClosing at 33.82 US cents per pound in Singapore on Monday, soybean prices are already at a near two-year high. The prices of soybeans and soybean oil surged this year as Chinese imports picked up after China signed an agreement with the United States in January to import additional US agricultural products. The price rise had been compounded by yield-damaging heavy rain in China's soy-producing regions.\nTraders believe that China is sitting on an enormous inventory of soybean oil. The current market scenario and high prices make it unfavorable for consumption in the country. The production of animal feed could further divert soybean oil to other purposes, thus reducing its use in the food industry.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to falling food demand, further driving down the price of soybean oil in China. Additionally, the country's domestic production of soybean oil is increasing, which means that the demand for imports is shrinking. Some traders believe that China will have to resell its purchases at a lower price, leading to a surplus of soybean oil in the markets.\nAnother reason for skepticism among traders is political tensions between China and India. India is one of the world's largest exporters of soybean oil. Given the escalating diplomatic tensions between the two countries, traders believe that China's enmity towards India may limit its import of soybean oil from the country.\nFurthermore, traders are skeptical about China's ability to import soybean oil in such large quantities. The country's ports have been congested, leading to long delays in the discharge of products and increased costs. This has made it challenging to transport goods efficiently, leading to delays in shipments. There are concerns that another wave of COVID-19 could lead to further congestion at ports, making it even more difficult for the country to import soybean oil.\nIt must be remembered that China's purchase of soybean oil has not been confirmed by the country's government or commodity brokers. However, rumors of the purchase have already led to a price increase in soybean oil. The underlying question is whether China can absorb the quantity being speculated, and how companies will react to an oversupply.\nIn conclusion, while China's purchase of soybean oil is aimed at bolstering the country's food security, traders in Asia are skeptical about the announcement. Market forces, including the country's ability to absorb large quantities of the commodity, domestic production, and transportation challenges, and the possibility of political tensions, make the purchase a high-risk proposition. Accordingly, investors, seller, and traders must consider both sides of the coin before they react to any announcement of China's soybean oil purchase.", "Europe's shipbuilding industry has unveiled a new generation of \"stealth\" warships with radar-beating technology that promises to give naval forces a decisive edge in future conflicts. The new vessels, which have been developed by major shipbuilders in countries such as France, Italy, Spain, and the UK, are designed to evade detection by enemy radar systems and operate in a range of environments, from coastal waters to open seas.\nThe development of these advanced warships comes amid growing concern among European naval powers about the increasing sophistication of rival military forces, particularly those of China and Russia. Both countries have been investing heavily in their own naval capabilities, with China building up its navy and Russia developing new technologies aimed at countering Western military assets.\nTo combat this threat, European shipbuilders have turned to innovative design concepts and materials, using cutting-edge technologies such as stealth coatings and adaptive camouflage to create vessels that can evade detection by enemy radar systems. The new warships also feature advanced communications systems, state-of-the-art sensor arrays, and high-performance engines that give them exceptional speed and agility.\nOne of the most notable features of the new warships is their ability to operate in shallow waters close to shore, where traditional naval vessels would be vulnerable to attack. This is thanks to their advanced propulsion systems and low radar profile, which enable them to navigate shallow waters undetected. This makes them well-suited to operations in coastal regions, such as those found in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.\nThe new warships are also built for endurance, with improved fuel efficiency and advanced power management systems that allow them to stay at sea for longer periods of time. This is vital in modern warfare, where naval assets are required to operate over extended periods in challenging environments ranging from the high seas to the arctic.\nDespite their advanced capabilities, the new warships are also designed with affordability and sustainability in mind. This is reflected in their use of modern, lightweight materials and advanced construction techniques that help to reduce their environmental impact and improve their operational efficiency. This makes them attractive to naval forces looking for cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions to their operational requirements.\nThe introduction of these new warships is expected to have a significant impact on global naval operations. They are likely to be deployed in a range of missions, from humanitarian relief efforts to anti-piracy operations and high-intensity conflicts. As such, they represent a major step forward in the evolution of naval warfare and signal a new era of innovation and technology in the shipbuilding industry.\nHowever, the development of these advanced warships also raises concerns about the potential for arms races and military escalation. As rival nations seek to outdo each other in the development of advanced naval assets, there is a risk of increased tension and conflict. It will be important for international powers to work together to ensure that these new technologies are used in a responsible and sustainable manner.\nOverall, the introduction of these new warships represents a major milestone in the development of naval capabilities in Europe and beyond. They provide an important tool for naval forces seeking to maintain a strategic advantage in an increasingly complex and challenging global security environment. However, it is equally important to ensure that their deployment is subject to careful consideration and international cooperation, in order to avoid the risks of military escalation and conflict.", "Pyramid schemes continue to be the most prevalent scam on the internet, despite efforts to clamp down on fraudulent activities. According to a recent report by the non-profit organization, Pyramid Scheme Alert (PSA), countless individuals have been duped through online pyramid schemes, resulting in significant monetary loss.\nThe report highlights various pyramid schemes, including chain letters, matrix schemes, and recruiting scams. These schemes operate under the premise of making money through the recruitment of other people into the scheme. Cadres of individuals are promised significant financial returns based on the recruitment of new members, creating a hierarchical or \u201cpyramidal\u201d structure. However, those who inevitably join the scheme at a later stage are the ones left struggling to recoup their losses.\nThe PSA report also found that there was a rise in cryptocurrency pyramid schemes. These schemes leveraged the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies and the lack of regulatory oversight in the cryptocurrency market. Similar to traditional pyramid schemes, these scams promote the idea that investors can generate quick profits through recruiting additional investors.\nThe report calls for stronger legal action against pyramid schemes and increased awareness among the public. \u201cUnfortunately, pyramid schemes are very attractive to people looking for quick and easy ways to make money,\u201d said Robert FitzPatrick, president of PSA. \u201cIt can be difficult for even sophisticated investors to differentiate between a pyramid scheme and a legitimate business opportunity.\u201d\nThe internet has made it easier for scammers to reach a broader audience, expanding their reach beyond geographical boundaries and increasing their potential victim pool. In recent years, law enforcement agencies have stepped up their efforts to combat online fraud. However, fraudsters continue to find new and sometimes sophisticated ways to scam unsuspecting victims.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also created an environment ripe for fraud. The report highlights a rise in the number of pyramid schemes that use the pandemic as a selling point to recruit new members. For example, some scams have promoted the idea of investing in personal protective equipment or pharmaceutical stocks, which have supposedly seen significant growth due to the pandemic.\nThe PSA is calling on individuals to be vigilant and urged to report any suspicious activities. The report emphasizes that people should thoroughly do their research before investing money and to avoid schemes that promote quick returns or seem too good to be true.\nOverall, the report is a reminder that internet-based pyramid schemes remain a real threat to investors and the public, and that it is essential to stay vigilant and informed.", "Dominion Resources, an American power and energy company, is rumored to be considering a $2 billion bid for British utility company, East Midlands Electricity Plc. This proposed acquisition would help Dominion Resources gain a foothold in the UK energy market.\nEast Midlands Electricity Plc provides electricity to over 4.3 million people in the Midlands region of the UK. The company is currently owned by private equity firm, Terra Firma, which acquired East Midlands Electricity Plc for \u00a31.2 billion in 2011.\nAccording to sources close to Dominion Resources, they are exploring this potential acquisition in an effort to expand their operations and increase their presence in the UK market. If the deal were to go through, it would represent a significant expansion for Dominion Resources, which currently operates mainly in the United States, and would be their first major international acquisition.\nThe process of acquiring East Midlands Electricity Plc would not be without competition, as there are several other companies that are rumored to be interested in acquiring the company. Some of the notable names that have been put forward as potential bidders include National Grid, ScottishPower, and SSE.\nHowever, Dominion Resources reportedly has an advantage over these other potential bidders due to its existing ties to the UK energy market. Dominion Resources already has a joint venture partnership with the infrastructure investment arm of UK investment bank, Barclays, called Fiberight. Fiberight intends to build a new waste-to-energy facility in the UK, and Dominion Resources\u2019 involvement in the joint venture could help them secure the necessary regulatory approvals.\nDominion Resources has not yet confirmed whether or not they will indeed make a bid for East Midlands Electricity Plc. However, analysts have suggested that it could be a smart move for the US energy company. By expanding its reach into the UK energy market, Dominion Resources would be diversifying its portfolio, which could be a key strategy in the face of fluctuating oil prices.\nA Dominion Resources spokesperson declined to comment on the speculation, stating that the company does not typically comment on rumors or speculation. East Midlands Electricity Plc also declined to comment on the rumor, stating that they cannot comment on potential bids or offers.\nAs the energy market continues to evolve, companies are looking for ways to consolidate their operations and expand their presence in new markets. Dominion Resources could be positioning itself as a major player not only in the US energy market but also in the international energy market if it is able to successfully bid for East Midlands Electricity Plc. However, for now, we must wait and see how this situation develops.", "News Corp, one of the world's largest media conglomerates has expressed disappointment at its Q1 performance, but remains confident of achieving its 20% profit target for the year. The company's CEO, Rupert Murdoch, announced the results in a press release on Monday.\nMurdoch said that despite growth in some of its businesses, News Corp's Q1 earnings were lower than the company had anticipated. He noted that advertising revenue in the US market was down, highlighting that additional challenges were posed by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant economic uncertainty.\nHowever, Murdoch remains optimistic that the company will continue to see growth and profitability in the coming year, buoyed by strong performances in the book publishing, digital real estate, and digital news sectors.\nMurdoch's assertion was backed up with revenue figures, with News Corp reporting strong performances in other areas of the business. The company's book publishing division saw a 23% increase in revenue, driven by strong sales of books from authors such as Dan Brown, and also welcomed the impact of a raft of new titles. Additionally, earnings from digital real estate services almost trebled while revenue from digital news platforms such as The Sun and The Wall Street Journal increased.\nSpeaking of the results, Murdoch said: \"Our results underscore the incredible resilience of our businesses, with record-breaking performances in book publishing and digital real estate offsetting the anticipated headwinds in the advertising industry. Despite challenges faced in Q1, we are confident that our businesses will continue to grow as we navigate the market in this unpredictable climate.\u201d\nIn a bid to bolster its performance, News Corp has recently seen a reshuffle in its leadership. Last month, the company appointed Almar Latour, the former publisher of The Wall Street Journal as its new Chief Executive Officer. Murdoch cited this as a significant factor that would \"re-energize and re-focus\" the company's efforts, adding that Latour's \"expertise and experience will be invaluable in helping us deliver on our goals.\"\nMurdoch also pointed to the company's continued focus on its digital strategy, saying that News Corp sees the digital space and the role of technology as a vital part of its growth strategy in the coming years. He added that the company was expanding its efforts in these areas, highlighting the success of News Corp\u2019s digital real estate services as proof of the company's dedication to its digital strategy.\n\"While we remain disappointed in our Q1 earnings, we remain confident that our businesses will continue to grow, thanks to our focus on digital initiatives and the strong leadership of Almar Latour. We remain committed to our target of a 20% profit increase for the year, and we are confident that our businesses will continue to thrive.\u201d\nConcluding his statement, Murdoch highlighted the potential for growth in areas such as subscription services, e-commerce and online advertising, and added: \u201cIt's clear that the digital space is where our focus needs to be in the coming months, and we're excited about our opportunities for growth in these areas.\u201d\nDespite a weaker than expected performance in Q1, News Corp remains bullish about the year ahead. With strong performances in a number of key areas, a renewed focus on digital strategy, and the appointment of a new CEO, the company remains confident of achieving its 20% profit target for the financial year.", "In a shocking move by the Chinese government, renowned dissident Liu Xiaobo has been sentenced to three years in a labour camp for \"inciting subversion of state power\". This follows his detention on December 8, 2008, after he co-authored Charter 08, a bold call for Chinese political reform and democracy. Liu, a former professor and writer, is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and has been a vocal critic of the Chinese Communist Party's stringent control over freedom of speech, human rights, and democracy.\nThe verdict was handed down on December 25 by a court in Beijing, with Liu unable to attend the trial because his lawyers were not allowed to meet with him. In a statement, the court accused Liu of \"spreading and disseminating information that had the effect of inciting subversion of state power and overthrowing the socialist system.\" This included his support of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, his role in drafting Charter 08, and his criticism of the Communist Party's one-party rule.\nThe verdict has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights groups and governments around the world. The United States State Department released a statement calling on the Chinese government to \"immediately release Liu Xiaobo, respect the human rights of all Chinese citizens, and uphold the rule of law.\" Similarly, Amnesty International labeled the verdict \"a dark day for the rule of law and human rights in China,\" while the Nobel Peace Prize committee stated that \"it is in violation of the international covenants on human rights.\"\nIn China, however, reactions have been mixed. Some supporters of the Communist Party have praised the verdict, arguing that Liu's calls for political reform could destabilize the country. Others, particularly younger activists and intellectuals, have voiced outrage at Liu's treatment and the ongoing repression of free speech and human rights in China. The verdict has also sparked protests, with several activists staging demonstrations outside the courthouse and online.\nThis is not the first time that Liu has been targeted by the Chinese government for his activism. In 2009, he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power,\" and was subsequently denied medical treatment for liver cancer. Despite international pressure, he was not released until 2017, when he was allowed to be treated abroad but died shortly after.\nThe verdict against Liu comes amid a broader crackdown on civil society and human rights in China, with the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping tightening its grip on power and curbing dissent. In recent years, activists, lawyers, and journalists have faced increasing harassment, surveillance, and imprisonment. In 2015, more than 200 human rights lawyers and activists were detained in a nationwide sweep, and many of them were subsequently sentenced to lengthy prison terms.\nLiu's case also highlights the challenges of promoting democracy and human rights in China. While his activism has been an inspiration to many, his calls for political reform and resistance to the Communist Party's rule have been perceived as a direct threat by the government. Critics argue that China's authoritarian system leaves little room for dissent and that any push for change must come from within the Communist Party itself.\nNevertheless, Liu's case has galvanized the international community and drawn attention to the ongoing struggle for human rights and democracy in China. It remains to be seen whether his legacy will inspire others to take up the mantle of activism and push for change, or whether the Chinese government's crackdown will continue unabated. For now, the verdict against Liu serves as a stark reminder of the risks faced by those who dare to speak out against injustice in China.", "MCI and Sprint, two of the top telecommunications giants in the United States, faced numerous challenges in their new ventures that affected their third-quarter profits. However, they managed to avoid the struggles experienced by their counterparts at AT&T in the consumer market.\nDespite the headwinds faced by the companies due to the pandemic, MCI and Sprint both reported relatively stable revenues in their respective financial statements released last week. However, the revenue figures that were reported told different stories about the companies' performance in the third quarter.\nWhile MCI reported a 7% decline in revenue from the previous year, Sprint's revenue remained largely unchanged. According to some analysts, this was not surprising given that MCI has been facing business headwinds, particularly within the enterprise space. The decline in revenue was largely attributed to MCI's decision to transition away from its traditional enterprise business model and to focus more on competing with cloud providers in the public cloud space. However, the company's ability to hold up against the headwinds was commendable, given the challenges that many other companies have faced in the current economic climate.\nMeanwhile, Sprint was not immune to operational challenges, and the company also released a statement indicating that its third-quarter earnings were impacted by the pandemic. Despite this, the telecom giant managed to overcome the challenges, thanks to its continued efforts to expand its 5G coverage and meet customer demands for high-speed internet services.\nWhile MCI and Sprint faced certain challenges in their Q3 performance, they were able to avoid the consumer market struggles experienced by AT&T. AT&T's woes continued in the third quarter, with the company recording weak sales across all of its businesses. This was largely attributed to the company's consumer-oriented services, which have been hit hard by competition from online streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nWhile AT&T's television and wireless services' revenues have been impacted by fierce competition from these online streaming services, its business services business remains relatively stable. The company's subscribers have contracted, and this has further complicated its efforts to compete with other telecoms. Recently, AT&T has announced a strategic shift away from cable TV, and towards a streaming-focused model. The company's recently launched HBO Max service is seen as an attempt to overcome its current struggles and to provide a new growth catalyst.\nIn contrast, both MCI and Sprint are more focused on enterprise solutions, with a smaller proportion of their target audiences consisting of individual consumers. In the case of MCI, the company has been repositioning itself around an expanded cloud offering, which has forced a reorientation of the traditional business model away from a focus on enterprise solutions. Sprint, meanwhile, has largely focused on expanding its 5G coverage.\nBoth companies have been leveraging their core competencies to drive growth, and this appears to be paying off in certain areas. As the pandemic has continued to strengthen work-from-home scenarios, MCI has been strategically positioning itself to provide solutions for remote workers. Meanwhile, Sprint's expansion into 5G is helping the company to meet the growing demand for high-speed wireless connectivity.\nOverall, while the third quarter presented several challenges for both MCI and Sprint, they managed to navigate the challenges and produce credible revenues for the period. These revenues present a solid foundation for the companies to build on in the coming quarters.\nGoing forward, MCI needs to be prepared to continue navigating challenges as it transitions away from its traditional enterprise model and expands into cloud services. Simultaneously, Sprint needs to continue its strategy of meeting the growing demands for high-speed wireless and providing customized solutions for businesses. How both companies fare in their next earnings statements will depend on how well they respond to these challenges and capitalize on their core competencies.", "Despite more declining issues than climbing ones on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), bank stocks have pushed the exchange into stronger territory, with the S&P/TSX Composite Index gaining 32.47 points to 15,832.09 at the end of Tuesday's trading session.\nAmong the big banks, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), and Bank of Montreal (BMO) all saw gains of over 1%, with RBC leading the way with a 1.64% increase. The Bank of Nova Scotia and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) saw more modest gains of 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.\nHowever, declining issues still marginally outnumbered advancing ones on the exchange, with 905 decliners compared to 882 advancers. The energy sector also continued to struggle, with Canadian Natural Resources and Suncor Energy both experiencing losses of 0.9%.\nDespite this, analysts have pointed to the strong performance of the banking sector as a reason for optimism on the TSX. The banks have been buoyed by bond yields increasing across North America, with investors optimistic about a potential rise in interest rates from central banks.\n\"The banks benefit from higher yields on lending in this environment, which could produce better loan growth, better net interest margins, and more revenues,\" said John M. Beck, CEO of Aecon Group.\nThe performance of bank stocks on the TSX also comes in the wake of a strong earnings season for the sector. RBC and TD both beat earnings expectations, with RBC announcing a 34% increase in profit compared to the same quarter last year.\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential impact of rising interest rates on the broader economy, particularly for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages.\n\"We are now at a stage where interest rates are slowly creeping higher,\" said Scott Terrio, manager of debtor advocacy at Hoyes, Michalos & Associates. \"For those with variable rates on their mortgages, it means that they will be paying more money just to service their debt. This could end up putting a lot of households under additional financial strain.\"\nDespite these concerns, many investors remain bullish on bank stocks, with some analysts predicting further gains for the sector in the coming months.\n\"It's a good time to be investing in financials,\" said Jennifer Radman, an investment advisor with The Wealth Co. \"The banks are well-capitalized, they are looking at growth opportunities, and they are returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. These are all good signs for investors.\"", "Toronto, Canada \u2013 Molson Coors Brewing Company suffered a significant setback on Monday, as the company lost the rights to brew one of its most popular beers, Coors Light. The news caused shares in Molson to plummet on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\nMolson had held the exclusive Canadian brewing rights for Coors Light for over three decades, but the company's agreement with the brand's parent company, Molson Coors USA, was set to expire at the end of 2020. Molson had been in negotiations with Molson Coors USA over a renewal of the agreement, but the two companies were unable to reach a mutually acceptable deal.\nAs a result of the failed negotiations, Molson will no longer be able to brew or distribute Coors Light in Canada. This represents a significant blow to the company, as Coors Light is one of the most popular beers in the country, accounting for a substantial portion of Molson's sales.\nThe news caused Molson's shares to fall sharply on the Toronto Stock Exchange. At the close of trading on Monday, Molson's stock had dropped by over 6%, wiping out more than $500 million in market value.\nInvestors were clearly rattled by the loss of the Coors Light rights, which could have a significant impact on the company's financial performance going forward. While Molson will still be able to brew and distribute a range of other beers, including Molson Canadian and Miller Genuine Draft, the loss of Coors Light represents a significant blow to the company's bottom line.\nMolson Coors USA, meanwhile, is expected to announce a new Canadian brewing partner in the coming months. This partner is likely to be one of Canada's other major brewers, such as Labatt or Sleeman, which will be eager to grab a share of the lucrative Coors Light market.\nFor Molson, the loss of the Coors Light rights is a reminder of the tough competition that exists in the Canadian beer market. The company will need to work hard to maintain its market share and continue to grow its sales in the face of this competition.\nIn a statement released on Monday, Molson CEO Mark Hunter said that the company was disappointed to lose the Coors Light rights, but was committed to continuing to provide consumers with \"high-quality, great-tasting beers\". He added that the company would be looking to invest in its other brands and explore new growth opportunities in order to maintain its competitive edge.\nWhile the loss of the Coors Light rights is undoubtedly a setback for Molson, the company has a long history of resilience and innovation. Whether it can weather this latest storm and continue to thrive in the Canadian beer market remains to be seen.", "Dominion Resources Inc, a US-based energy company, has expressed interest in bidding for East Midlands Electricity Plc, one of the largest electricity distribution networks in the UK. However, the company has stated that it will only proceed with the bid if the share price remains in a reasonable range.\nEast Midlands Electricity Plc serves over 4.9 million customers across the East Midlands region of England and has a regulated asset value of \u00a33.4 billion. The company was recently put up for sale by parent company Western Power Distribution.\nDominion Resources Inc has a large presence in the North American energy market and has been looking to expand its business into Europe. In a statement released yesterday, the company said that it sees potential in the UK energy market and is interested in acquiring East Midlands Electricity Plc.\nHowever, the company also stated that it will only make a bid if the share price remains reasonable. \"We are attracted to the strategic fit of East Midlands Electricity Plc with our existing business and see potential for growth in the UK market,\" said a spokesperson for Dominion Resources Inc. \"However, we will only proceed with the bid if the share price remains in a range that makes financial sense for our company.\"\nThe statement from Dominion Resources Inc comes amid speculation that the share price of East Midlands Electricity Plc could skyrocket if several other potential bidders enter the race. The company is seen as a valuable asset with a large customer base and a strong track record of profitability.\nSeveral other companies, including National Grid and French utility company EDF, have also expressed interest in acquiring the electricity network. Analysts predict that bidding could become competitive, pushing the share price up considerably.\nDominion Resources Inc has stated that it is prepared to walk away from the bid if the share price becomes too high. \"We are interested in this acquisition, but we will not overpay for the asset,\" said the spokesperson. \"We will carefully evaluate the market and the potential value of the company before making any offer.\"\nThe bidding process for East Midlands Electricity Plc is expected to begin in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen whether Dominion Resources Inc will follow through with its interest and make a bid for the company, or whether it will be outbid by one of its competitors.", "As the sun began to rise on the Friday morning after Thanksgiving, crowds of eager shoppers were already gathered outside of retail stores across the country. From electronics to clothing to home goods, shoppers set their sights on snagging the best deals and kicking off the holiday shopping season.\nThis annual tradition, known as Black Friday, has become a staple of American consumer culture. Stores often offer significant discounts on highly sought-after items, drawing in throngs of shoppers who are willing to brave the long lines and early wake-up calls in order to save big.\nIn New York City, shoppers began lining up outside of the flagship Macy's store in Herald Square as early as 4 a.m. The store opened its doors at 5 a.m., and the crush of shoppers that poured inside was overwhelming. \"It's crazy in there,\" said one shopper, who had been waiting in line for over an hour. \"But the deals are worth it.\"\nAt Best Buy locations across the country, shoppers camped out overnight in order to be first in line when the doors opened at 6 a.m. \"I've been here since yesterday afternoon, but it's totally worth it,\" said one shopper, who was hoping to score a discounted 65-inch television.\nThe scene was similar at malls and shopping centers around the country, with lines snaking out of stores and into parking lots. Some retailers, such as Walmart and Target, even opened their doors on Thanksgiving Day itself, giving shoppers a head start on their Black Friday shopping.\nFor many people, Black Friday shopping is as much of a tradition as turkey dinner on Thanksgiving. \"It's just something we do every year,\" said one shopper outside of a Target store in St. Paul, Minnesota. \"It's a fun way to kick off the holiday season.\"\nBut not everyone is a fan of the annual shopping frenzy. Critics argue that the consumerism of Black Friday has overshadowed the true meaning of the holiday season. Rather than focusing on family, friends, and giving back to those in need, they say, Americans have become obsessed with buying more and more stuff.\n\"The rampant consumerism of Black Friday is a disturbing trend,\" said one commentator. \"It's a sad reflection of how materialistic our society has become.\"\nOthers have pointed out the negative impact that Black Friday can have on workers. Many retail employees are required to work long hours, often without overtime pay or other benefits. In recent years, some workers have organized protests against this trend, calling for better wages and working conditions for those in the retail industry.\nDespite these concerns, however, Black Friday remains as popular as ever. According to a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation, an estimated 165 million Americans planned to shop over the course of the Thanksgiving weekend, with an average of $313 spent per person.\nFor retailers, this annual shopping extravaganza is an opportunity to boost their bottom line and kick off the holiday season with a bang. \"Black Friday is our biggest day of the year,\" said one store manager. \"We've been preparing for this for months.\"\nIn order to stay competitive, many retailers have extended their Black Friday deals throughout the entire weekend and even into Cyber Monday, the online shopping holiday that takes place on the Monday after Thanksgiving. This year, online sales are expected to grow even more rapidly than in years past, with an estimated $9.4 billion spent on Cyber Monday alone.\nIn the end, the success or failure of Black Friday often comes down to the deals on offer. For many shoppers, the allure of deep discounts on popular items is simply too much to resist. Come rain or shine, they'll be lining up outside of stores early next Black Friday morning, eagerly awaiting the chance to score a bargain.", "In a recent announcement, Chrysler reported a staggering 92 percent increase in profits, largely attributed to strong sales of trucks and SUVs. The American automaker, which is a subsidiary of Italian-American multinational corporation Fiat Chrysler, reported a net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2019.\nThe company\u2019s revenue also showed an impressive increase of 4 percent, with strong sales in North America, the company\u2019s most profitable market. The demand for Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs has been a driving force in Chrysler\u2019s stellar performance this quarter.\n\u201cChrysler\u2019s strong performance in Q1 can be credited to our relentless focus on customer satisfaction and our robust product lineup,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, CEO of Fiat Chrysler. \u201cWe are confident that we will continue to see growth in the coming quarters, thanks to our excellent relationship with our customers and a continued focus on innovation and quality in our products.\u201d\nChrysler\u2019s Ram trucks, which include the popular 1500 and 2500 models, saw an impressive 25 percent increase in sales over the previous year. The new Ram 1500 has received rave reviews for its innovative design, which includes a new eTorque hybrid system that significantly improves torque and fuel efficiency. Additionally, the Ram 2500 has seen a 24 percent increase in sales due to its best-in-class towing capacity and powerful engine options.\nSimilarly, Chrysler\u2019s Jeep SUV lineup saw a significant increase in sales, with the Jeep Grand Cherokee leading the way with a 23 percent increase in sales. Consumers have also shown strong interest in the Jeep Wrangler, which features a refreshed design and advanced technology. Additionally, the all-new Jeep Gladiator, a pickup truck designed for off-road and adventure enthusiasts, has been garnering strong interest and is expected to boost sales further in the coming quarters.\nChrysler\u2019s strong performance this quarter is indicative of a larger trend in the automotive industry. Consumers in North America have been showing an increased preference for trucks and SUVs over sedans and hatchbacks, due to a variety of factors. Low gas prices, which have been relatively stable in recent years, have made the larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles more affordable and attractive to consumers. Additionally, the growing popularity of outdoor and adventure activities has led to an increased demand for vehicles that are capable of handling rugged terrain and off-road conditions.\nChrysler has been investing heavily in its truck and SUV lineup in recent years, recognizing the shift in consumer preferences. The company has made significant improvements to the styling, features, and performance of its Ram trucks and Jeep SUVs, and this investment has paid off in spades. Consumers have responded positively to these improvements, leading to strong sales and increased profits for the company.\nChrysler has also been adopting new technologies that have improved its vehicles\u2019 performance and efficiency. The eTorque hybrid system in the Ram 1500, for example, improves the truck\u2019s torque and fuel efficiency, making it more attractive to consumers who want a powerful, capable pickup that is also environmentally responsible.\nLooking forward, Chrysler is poised to continue its impressive performance. The company has a strong product lineup that is well-suited to the shifting preferences of consumers, and it has been investing in research and development to ensure that its future offerings meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.\n\u201cWe are committed to delivering the best possible products to our customers, and we believe that our strong performance in Q1 is a testament to our dedication and hard work,\u201d said Marchionne. \u201cWe will continue to invest in our products and our people, and we are confident that we will see continued growth and success in the years to come.\u201d\nThe news of Chrysler\u2019s impressive performance has been met with enthusiasm from investors, who have seen the company\u2019s stock price rise significantly in recent weeks. The automaker\u2019s strong performance is indicative of a broader trend in the automotive industry, which is witnessing a shift towards larger, more capable vehicles that meet the needs and preferences of today\u2019s consumers. With its strong product lineup and commitment to continued innovation, Chrysler is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory and maintain its position as one of the leading automakers in North America.", "The ongoing General Motors (GM) strike in Canada shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, according to Jerry Dias, the President of the Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union.\n\"I wish I could tell you we're close, but we're really not,\" Dias said during a recent press conference. The strike, which began on September 17, has affected more than 3,000 workers at a GM plant in Oshawa, Ontario.\nThe workers are striking for better job security and a reversal of GM's decision to close the Oshawa plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans. The plant was supposed to close in December of this year, but the CAW wants GM to keep it open and assign new products to it.\nDias said that the two sides are still far apart on these issues, and that GM hasn't budged on its decision to close the Oshawa plant. \"They're holding firm to their position,\" he said.\nIn addition to Oshawa, the GM strike has affected workers at two other Canadian plants in St. Catharines and Windsor, who have been temporarily laid off due to a lack of parts from the Oshawa plant.\nDias said that the CAW is doing its best to support the striking workers, but that it's difficult to sustain a long strike. \"It's a game of attrition,\" he said.\nThe strike has already caused a ripple effect in the Canadian auto industry, as suppliers and dealers who rely on GM are feeling the impact. According to a report from Bloomberg, the overall economic impact of the strike could be as much as $5 billion.\nDespite these consequences, Dias said that the CAW will continue to fight for the workers' demands. \"We're not going to roll over and give up,\" he said.\nThe Oshawa plant has been part of Canada's auto industry since 1907, and its closure would be a significant blow to the area's economy. The CAW has argued that GM has a responsibility to the workers and the community, and that the company should keep the plant open for the long term.\nFor now, however, the strike continues with no end in sight. Dias said that he doesn't expect a resolution anytime soon, and that the CAW will continue to negotiate with GM in the hopes of reaching a deal.", "Reports of a consortium bid for the Montreal Canadiens have been making headlines in recent days, sparking rumours that the team's owner, Geoff Molson, is looking to sell the franchise. However, Molson has come out to deny these rumours, stating that he has no intentions of selling the Canadiens.\nIn a statement released on Thursday, Molson confirmed that he had received an offer from a consortium of investors, but he stressed that he was not interested in selling the team. \"There have been rumours circulating in the media about a possible sale of the Montreal Canadiens,\" Molson said. \"I want to be clear that these rumours are false. I have no intention of selling the team at this time, or in the foreseeable future.\"\nMolson's statement comes after reports surfaced earlier this week that a group of investors was preparing to make a bid for the Canadiens. The group, which includes former players and business executives, is said to be interested in acquiring the team, which is currently valued at around $1.3 billion.\nDespite Molson's denial, the rumours of a possible sale have continued to circulate, with some speculating that he may be considering the offer from the consortium. However, Molson's statement appears to put an end to these rumours, at least for now.\nThe Montreal Canadiens are one of the most storied and successful franchises in all of professional sports, with a history stretching back over a century. The team has won 24 Stanley Cup championships, more than any other team in NHL history.\nThe current season has been a challenging one for the Canadiens, who have struggled to find consistency on the ice. However, the team remains a valuable asset, with a loyal fan base and a reputation as one of the most iconic franchises in all of sports.\nFor now, it appears that Molson is committed to keeping the Canadiens under his ownership, and fans can rest assured that the team will continue to call Montreal home for the foreseeable future. As Molson stated in his statement, \"I am fully committed to the Montreal Canadiens and to continuing to build this great franchise into the future.\"", "In the ever-changing world of internet service providers (ISPs), Prodigy Inc. has just made a major entrance. The company has recently launched its newest product, Prodigy Internet, offering customers unlimited internet access for a competitive price of $19.95 per month.\nProdigy Inc. is not a new company in the market. It was launched in the 1980s as a provider of online services, including email, news, stock quotes, and games. The company was one of the early innovators in the online industry and was acquired by SBC Communications (now AT&T) in 2001. After several re-brandings, the company is now relaunching itself as a full-fledged ISP with a revamped service model.\n\"We are proud to introduce Prodigy Internet, offering unlimited internet access to customers who demand exceptional service at a fair price,\" said Jill Robinson, CEO of Prodigy Inc. \"We see a great opportunity in the market to bring back the values that made Prodigy a pioneer in the online industry. With a focus on customer satisfaction and affordability, we believe that Prodigy Internet can become a leader in the ISP market.\"\nThe new service aims to provide fast and reliable internet access to its customers through different technology options, including DSL, fiber, and cable. The company has partnered with major telecommunications providers across the United States, including AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast, to offer its services to a wide range of customers.\nOne of the main selling points of Prodigy Internet is its unlimited data plan. Many traditional ISPs limit the amount of data customers can use per month, imposing overage fees or throttling the internet speed if customers exceed their quota. Prodigy Internet promises to offer unlimited data with no hidden fees or data caps.\n\"We believe that customers should not have to worry about data caps or unexpected bills. With Prodigy Internet, you can stream, download, and browse as much as you want without having to count your kilobytes,\" says Robinson.\nAnother key feature of Prodigy Internet is its competitive pricing. Starting at $19.95 per month, the service is cheaper than many other ISPs on the market, which can charge up to $80 for comparable plans. Prodigy Inc. has positioned itself as a disruptor in the ISP market, challenging the dominance of traditional providers and aiming to offer more affordable and transparent options for customers.\n\"We want to provide an alternative to the status quo. Many customers feel frustrated with the high prices and poor customer service of traditional ISPs. We believe that Prodigy Internet can change that by offering a better service at a lower cost,\" says Robinson.\nProdigy Internet also offers a flexible service model, with customers able to choose from different plans and technology options depending on their needs. For example, customers in urban areas may prefer cable or fiber optic internet, while those in rural areas may rely on DSL or satellite.\nThe launch of Prodigy Internet comes at a time when the demand for internet services has surged due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With millions of people working and studying from home, internet service has become more crucial than ever. However, many customers have also faced connectivity issues, slow speeds, and high prices from their ISPs.\nProdigy Inc. hopes to address these challenges by providing a service that is fast, reliable, and affordable. The company has invested in building a robust infrastructure and partnering with trusted providers to ensure that its customers receive the best possible service.\n\"We believe that access to high-quality internet should be a basic right in the 21st century. By launching Prodigy Internet, we want to make that a reality for more people across the country,\" says Robinson.\nOverall, the launch of Prodigy Internet marks an important moment in the ISP market. As competition increases and customers demand more from their providers, Prodigy Inc. has positioned itself as a viable alternative with a strong commitment to customer satisfaction, affordability, and transparency. It remains to be seen how the company will fare against established ISPs, but Prodigy Internet has the potential to shake up the market and offer a better deal for internet users.", "London, U.K. - Ladbroke Group and Hilton Hotels Corp announced today their reunion in a global alliance over 32 years since they last combined forces. The move is expected to strengthen the hospitality industry, providing hotel patrons with greater access to a wider range of services and experiences.\nThe Ladbroke Group, which owns Ladbrokes Coral Group, is one of the largest sports betting and gaming corporations in the world. With a presence in Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia, they have become a leader in the industry. Hilton Hotels Corp, on the other hand, is one of the most recognizable names in the hotel industry with properties in more than 100 countries.\nThe newly formed alliance will allow for the creation of numerous marketing and joint venture partnerships that will offer customers unique experiences and services. Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s extensive customer database will be combined with the Hilton Honors loyalty program. This will enable customers to have access to added benefits, services, and experiences when they book Hilton hotels worldwide.\nJane Torrance, Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Ladbrokes Coral Group, has stated that \"We are excited to announce our reunion with Hilton Hotels Corp. This global alliance will help us diversify our business portfolio, and elevate the level of services we offer customers. We believe the brand and loyalty strengths of both companies will pave the way for further opportunities in the future.\"\nThis move is just the latest in a string of recent acquisitions and mergers in the hotel industry, as corporations aim to attract more customers to their properties. Some of the most significant mergers in recent memory include the Marriott-Starwood merger and Accor\u2019s purchase of Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissotel. The goal of these mergers is to create a more consolidated industry that can offer more extensive customer bases and greater economies of scale.\nChristopher J. Nassetta, CEO of Hilton Hotels Corp, said \u201cWe are delighted to reunite with Ladbrokes Coral Group after all these years. This alliance will allow us to provide a superior level of service that will benefit our customers, employees, and the industry as a whole.\u201d\nWith Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s extensive customer database and Hilton Hotels Group's global reach, the potential for this partnership is limitless. The alliance will likely enable both companies to reach new markets and offer innovative services, while creating new revenue streams and benefits for their customers. The reunion between these two industry giants provides a clear visualization of how the hospitality industry is undergoing a revolution, and how alliances are becoming more important than ever.", "Whitbread, the UK\u2019s largest hotel and restaurant group, has reported strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities despite a recent slump in National Lottery ticket sales.\nAlison Brittain, CEO of Whitbread, has attributed the growth to increased disposable income and the rise in staycations within the UK. She also commented on the positive impact of the National Living Wage, which has boosted wages for low-paid workers and increased their disposable income.\n\u201cConsumer confidence remains robust and we are seeing increased leisure spend across our brands,\u201d said Brittain. \u201cDespite a dip in National Lottery ticket sales, we are seeing strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities such as dining out, cinema, and short breaks.\u201d\nWhitbread\u2019s brands include Premier Inn, Costa Coffee, Beefeater, and Brewers Fayre. The company is one of the largest employers in the UK, with over 50,000 employees.\nBrittain added that the majority of Whitbread\u2019s customers are UK residents, with over 90% of Premier Inn\u2019s guests being from within the UK. This has enabled the company to benefit from the trend for staycations, with Brittain noting that Premier Inn has seen \u201crecord levels of occupancy\u201d in popular tourist destinations such as Cornwall and Devon.\nThe rise in staycations has been attributed to a number of factors, including the weak pound, which has made foreign travel more expensive, and the uncertain political climate in Europe. Meanwhile, the National Living Wage has had a positive impact on low-paid workers, many of whom are employed in the leisure and hospitality sectors.\nHowever, the recent decline in National Lottery sales has been a concern for some businesses, as they fear that it could be a sign of weakening consumer confidence. The National Lottery reported a 9% drop in ticket sales in the 2016/17 financial year, with sales falling by \u00a3670m compared to the previous year.\nSome observers have attributed the decline to changes made to the Lotto game, which saw the number of balls increase from 49 to 59, making it harder to win the jackpot. Others suggest that the rise of online gambling and other leisure activities could be diverting consumer spend away from the National Lottery.\nDespite this, Brittain remains optimistic about the outlook for the leisure and hospitality sector, citing the positive impact of the National Living Wage and the continued growth of consumer spending on leisure activities. She added that Whitbread plans to continue investing in its brands to ensure they remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market.\n\u201cWe are committed to delivering exceptional value and experiences for our customers, and we will continue to invest in our brands to ensure they remain relevant and attractive in an increasingly competitive market,\u201d she said.\nIn conclusion, Whitbread\u2019s CEO, Alison Brittain, has expressed confidence in the outlook for the leisure and hospitality sector, despite concerns over the decline in National Lottery sales. The rise of staycations, increased disposable income, and the positive impact of the National Living Wage have all contributed to strong growth in consumer spending on leisure activities. However, businesses must remain vigilant and continue to innovate in order to compete in a rapidly changing market.", "Virgin Atlantic is considering replacing its aircraft for the high demand Hong Kong-London route due to increased demand. The airline currently operates Airbus A350 and Boeing 787-9 on the route, but it is considering adding new planes for this popular route.\nVirgin Atlantic\u2019s CEO, Shai Weiss, revealed that the airline is examining various options to improve the customer experience on this route. He added that the airline is committed to providing its passengers with the best possible service and that upgrading its fleet would be a significant step in that direction.\nThe company is looking at larger, more spacious aircraft that can accommodate more passengers comfortably, as well as those that offer improved fuel efficiency.

Net income jumped to $15.5 billion, or $2.03 a share, compared with $10.8 billion, or $1.40 a share, in the same quarter last year.\n\"The third quarter was a very strong quarter for Microsoft, driven by continued cloud strength and usage and demand growth,\" said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft.\nOne of Microsoft's biggest strength lies in its Azure cloud service, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Azure revenue surged 50% in the latest quarter, compared with a 47% rise in the previous quarter. The company said that Azure managed to reach a $50 billion annualized revenue run rate during the quarter.\nMicrosoft's commercial cloud revenue, which includes the Azure cloud security platforms along with its Dynamics 365 business application suite and Office 365 productivity suite, climbed 33% year-over-year to $17.7 billion.\nOffice 365 also enjoyed solid growth: The service now has more than 258 million users, an increase of 15% compared to the same time last year, Microsoft said.\nMore than a year into the pandemic, companies worldwide have overwhelmingly turned to cloud computing services to enable remote work for their employees. Microsoft has been at the forefront of this trend, and the company continues to benefit from the shift towards cloud-based work.\nThe company has also seen solid demand for its Xbox gaming console, thanks to increased sales amid the pandemic. Xbox content and services revenue grew by 34% in the latest quarter.\nMicrosoft's impressive results come at a time when many other companies are still grappling with the aftermath of the pandemic. For Microsoft, the pandemic has been a tailwind rather than a headwind. Sales at many of its businesses accelerated due to the pandemic's impact on digital transformation and remote work, while demand for its gaming products surged as more people shifted to gaming as a form of entertainment during lockdowns.\nMicrosoft's strong Q3 results were widely anticipated by Wall Street analysts. Shares of Microsoft rose more than 2% in after-market trading on Tuesday.\n\"Overall, we continue to see Azure and Office 365 as the key growth drivers for Microsoft in the next 2-3 years,\" said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.\nLooking ahead, Microsoft said it expects strong demand to continue for its cloud services, and the company also projected that its Xbox gaming business would continue to grow.\n\"The increasing focus on working and learning from home will continue to drive demand for Microsoft's products and services,\" Nadella said.\nMicrosoft has become one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its business in cloud computing and office productivity software. As more businesses shift towards cloud-based computing and remote work, Microsoft appears to be on track to continue its solid growth path in the coming years.", "As the third quarter of 2021 comes to a close, analysts are anticipating that competitive Internet stocks will report near-term profit sacrifices for long-term growth in their Q3 returns. The tech industry has been experiencing a surge in demand as more people rely on online services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, competition in the market has been heating up, forcing companies to invest in innovation and expansion to maintain their position in the market.\nOne of the key players in the industry is Amazon, which saw its quarterly revenue reach $113 billion in Q2 2021, up 27% compared to the same period the previous year. Amazon's e-commerce platform and cloud computing services have fueled the company's growth, but analysts are predicting that the company may experience some challenges in the coming months due to increased competition. Amazon's recent move to acquire MGM for $8.45 billion could give the company an edge in the streaming industry, but it may take some time to see a return on this investment.\nAnother major player in the industry is Facebook, which reported $29 billion in revenue for Q2 2021, up 56% compared to the same period last year. The company has been investing in new features, such as shopping on Instagram and virtual reality, to diversify its revenue streams. However, Facebook is also facing increased scrutiny from regulators and the public, which could impact its growth in the long term.\nGoogle's parent company, Alphabet, reported $61.9 billion in revenue for Q2 2021, up 62% compared to last year. The company has been investing in artificial intelligence and cloud-based services to expand its business beyond its core search engine. However, Google is also facing regulatory challenges, particularly in Europe, which could impact its long-term growth.\nOther companies, such as Netflix and Apple, are also facing increased competition in the market. Netflix has seen slower growth in its subscriber base, while Apple has been impacted by supply chain issues and regulatory challenges. Both companies are expected to continue investing in new content and technology to maintain their position in the market.\nDespite the challenges, analysts believe that these companies are making necessary investments in innovation and expansion to sustain their long-term growth. This may come at the cost of near-term profits, but investors are willing to be patient as they see the potential for these companies to dominate their respective industries in the future.\nOne area where Internet companies are focusing on is artificial intelligence (AI), which has the potential to revolutionize various industries. Google has been investing heavily in AI research, while Facebook has been developing AI-powered tools for content moderation. Amazon has also been utilizing AI to improve its e-commerce platform, while Apple has been incorporating AI into its devices and services.\nAnother area of focus for these companies is the development of 5G technology, which will enable faster connectivity and open up new opportunities for innovation. Companies such as Apple and Google have been incorporating 5G technology into their devices, while telecom companies such as Verizon and AT&T have been investing in building out their 5G networks.\nOverall, analysts predict that Internet stocks will report near-term profit sacrifices for long-term growth in their Q3 returns. However, investors are optimistic about the potential of these companies to dominate their respective industries in the future, particularly in the areas of AI and 5G technology. As competition in the market continues to heat up, companies will need to continue investing in innovation and expansion to maintain their position and stay ahead of the curve.", "Despite gains in the gold and real estate sectors, Toronto stocks ended softer on Monday.

The protest was organized by the families of kidnapped victims and human rights organizations.\nThe protesters, who were mainly dressed in white to symbolize peace and unity, marched from the Plaza Bolivar to the Presidential Palace. The streets were full of people carrying banners and placards, chanting \u2018No more kidnappings!\u2019 and waving flags and balloons. The atmosphere was one of anger and determination as thousands of voices echoed through the central streets of the Colombian capital.\nThe demand was simple - an end to kidnappings of any form, whether they are for ransom, politics, or any other motive. The kidnappings have caused immense pain and suffering for the families involved, and the organizers hope that by joining forces, they can send a clear message to the politicians that enough is enough.\nOne of the protesters, Maria Rodriguez, whose brother was a victim of kidnapping in Colombia, said: \"We want our government and society to take action to protect us. We are tired of living in fear, and we want an end to this nightmare.\u201d\nAnother protester, Andres Torres, added: \"We are here to demand that our government takes action to prevent further kidnappings in the country. It is our right to live in a safe environment, and we will not rest until this happens.\u201d\nColombia has been struggling with the issue of kidnappings for decades, with hundreds of people being kidnapped every year. The kidnappings are carried out by various groups, including guerrilla groups, criminal gangs, and drug cartels. They are often used as a means of extortion and are a blight on the country's reputation.\nIn recent years, the government has taken steps to tackle the problem, including increasing security measures and passing legislation that gives harsher penalties to kidnappers. However, many feel that more needs to be done.\n\"The government needs to take this issue seriously and prioritize it in their agenda,\" said Carlos Garcia, a spokesperson for a human rights organization. \"They need to listen to the people and take action to end this scourge once and for all.\u201d\nThe protest was not just limited to Bogota, with similar demonstrations taking place in other major cities across the country. The protesters hope that the show of solidarity will send a powerful message to the authorities and bring about change.\nPresident Ivan Duque responded to the protest by pledging to strengthen the fight against kidnapping. In a statement, he said: \"We will not rest until our country is free of kidnappings. This issue affects us all, and we will work together to end it.\u201d\nThe protest was a reminder that despite the challenges faced by the country, the people of Colombia are united in their desire for a better and safer future. The kidnapped victims and their families deserve justice and a peaceful life, and this protest was a step forward towards that goal.", "BT has secured its place as a leader in the global telecommunications market following the completion of its $20 billion merger with MCI, the largest in the industry to date. The acquisition sees BT expand its presence in the US, MCI's biggest market, and strengthens its position in the global data services industry. MCI's extensive network infrastructure and customer base are expected to complement BT's existing offerings, creating a formidable force in the telecoms sector. This deal marks a significant step in BT's growth strategy, with the company's CEO hailing the merger as a \"game-changer\" for the industry.", "As the deadline for a new contract between the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and General Motors (GM) approaches, negotiations are heating up between the two sides.\nThe current contract between the UAW and GM, which covers approximately 46,000 workers in the United States, is set to expire on September 14th. In the lead-up to this deadline, the two sides have been working to hammer out a new agreement that satisfies both parties' interests.\nThe negotiations are taking place against the backdrop of a changing automotive industry. GM and other major auto manufacturers are grappling with a range of challenges, including the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, increasing competition from foreign companies, and shifting consumer preferences.\nIn this context, the UAW is keen to secure a contract that provides job security and improved wages and benefits for its members. The union has already secured some wins during the current negotiations, including a proposed wage increase and a pathway for temporary workers to become full-time employees.\nHowever, there are still several contentious issues that need to be resolved. One major sticking point is the fate of three GM factories that were shuttered earlier this year. The UAW is pushing for these plants to be reopened and for their employees to be rehired. GM, on the other hand, has expressed reluctance to make such a commitment.\nAnother point of tension between the two sides is the growing trend towards hybrid and electric vehicles. The UAW wants to make sure that GM's investment in these technologies translates into job security for its members. However, the company is navigating a delicate balancing act between investing in future mobility solutions and maintaining profitability in the short term.\nDespite these challenges, both sides have expressed a commitment to reaching a deal before the deadline. A spokesperson for GM said that the company was \"working hard to reach an agreement that builds a stronger future for its employees, dealers, and the communities where it operates.\" Similarly, a UAW representative stated that the union was \"doing everything in its power to ensure that its members are protected and can continue to build world-class vehicles.\"\nObservers of the negotiations say that the stakes are high for both GM and the UAW. For GM, a protracted strike or labor disruption could be costly and damaging to its reputation. For the UAW, a failure to secure a strong contract could weaken its bargaining position in future negotiations with other automakers.\nUltimately, the outcome of the UAW-GM contract negotiations will have significant implications for both the automotive industry and the broader labor market. As the deadline approaches, all eyes will be on the bargaining table - and on the potential impact of the new contract on the lives of thousands of workers across the country.", "Ford Motor Co. has announced that two of its top executives Todd Eckert and Joy Falotico will be promoted to contend for the top spot at the company. The announcement comes after current CEO Alex Trotman announced his retirement plans earlier this year.\nEckert, who is currently the Ford's marketing chief, will be promoted to be in charge of U.S. sales, service and Parts. Falotico, currently the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, will take over as group vice president and chief marketing officer. The two executives will join other members of Ford's Office of the Chairman, including Trotman, to help oversee the company.\n\"Both of these experienced executives have proven track records of helping Ford navigate through challenging times, and they are the right people to take Ford forward,\" said Trotman in a statement.\nEckert is a nine-year Ford veteran who has led the company's marketing efforts as it's attempted to revamp sales strategy and embrace new technologies including electric vehicles and self-driving cars. Eckert joined the company in 2012 as Ford's director of truck and SUV marketing and has led the launch of the new Ford Explorer.\nFalotico is an eight-year Ford veteran who has led the company's global marketing efforts as well as its luxury Lincoln brand. In that role, Falotico has overseen the launch of several new Lincoln models and has been credited with helping to bring the brand back from the brink of extinction.\nThe promotions come at a time when Ford is struggling to regain its footing in a rapidly changing automotive industry. The company has been hit hard by the global pandemic, which forced it to shut down plants and close dealerships. Additionally, Ford has struggled to keep up with the fast-paced developments in electric vehicles and self-driving technology, which many experts believe will be the future of the automobile industry.\nFord has also come under fire in recent years for its slow progress on issues of diversity and inclusion. Several high-profile incidents have highlighted the challenges faced by the company in an industry that has traditionally been dominated by white men.\nIn response to these challenges, Ford has launched a number of initiatives aimed at boosting its competitiveness and addressing social and environmental concerns. The company has launched a new line of electric vehicles and pledged to invest heavily in renewable energy. Ford has also made a commitment to diversity and inclusion, including a new program aimed at increasing the number of women and people of color in leadership roles.\nThe promotions of Eckert and Falotico are seen as a positive step for the company, as both executives have demonstrated a strong commitment to innovation, sustainability, and diversity. The promotions also signal a strategic shift for the company as it seeks to adapt to the changing automotive landscape.\n\"The auto industry is evolving rapidly, and we need to be able to adapt quickly,\" said Eckert. \"I'm excited to take on this new role and help lead Ford into the future.\"\nFalotico echoed those sentiments, saying, \"This is a critical time for Ford, and I'm honored to have the opportunity to help lead the company forward. I believe that by staying true to our values and continuing to embrace innovation, we can succeed in this rapidly changing industry.\"\nAs Eckert and Falotico prepare to take on their new roles, all eyes will be on them as they work to steer Ford through uncertain times and position the company for long-term success. With many challenges ahead, the two executives will need to draw upon all their skills and experience to navigate the changing terrain of the automotive industry and ensure that Ford remains competitive in the years to come.", "Ivory Coast, one of the world's largest cocoa producers, has approved revised electronic auction rules aimed at curbing overbidding and ensuring a fair market price for farmers.\nAccording to the country's coffee and cocoa council (CCC), the new rules will require bidders to pay a deposit equivalent to the value of 30% of the amount they purchase on the platform.\nThe deposit will be used to pay for any cocoa that the bidder fails to purchase after participating in the auction, the CCC said in a statement.\nThis move comes after the CCC received complaints from cocoa farmers about overbidding by buyers and a lack of transparency in the sale process.\n\"The new measures will ensure more transparency and fairness in the auction process, which will ultimately benefit farmers by getting them a fair price for their cocoa,\" said the CCC's head, Yves Brahima Kon\u00e9.\nThe CCC has been utilizing electronic auctions since 2012, which were intended to create a more transparent and efficient system for cocoa sales. However, the system has been criticized for favoring big buyers and overbidding.\nUnder the new rules, buyers will be limited to purchasing no more than 120 lots during a single auction, or approximately 240 metric tons of cocoa. This will prevent large buyers from dominating the auction and pushing prices up, which would negatively affect smaller buyers and farmers.\n\"We are confident that the revised electronic auction system will lead to more competition among buyers, benefitting farmers and the cocoa sector as a whole,\" said Kon\u00e9.\nIvory Coast is a crucial player in the global cocoa market, producing over 2 million metric tons of cocoa beans annually. The country's cocoa exports are worth an estimated $3 billion, representing a significant portion of Ivory Coast's economy.\nThe country's cocoa sector has been plagued by numerous challenges, including low prices, climate change, and child labor. Recent efforts have focused on improving working conditions for farmers and addressing child labor in the cocoa industry.\nIn addition to the new electronic auction rules, Ivory Coast has also implemented various measures aimed at improving the lives of cocoa farmers. For example, the country recently launched a program to help farmers switch to more sustainable cocoa farming practices. The program provides farmers with seedlings and training on how to grow cocoa in a way that is more environmentally friendly and sustainable.\nOverall, the new electronic auction rules represent a positive step forward for Ivory Coast's cocoa sector. The rules will help ensure a fair price for farmers and improve the overall transparency and efficiency of the auction process.\nHowever, some experts have warned that the new rules may not be enough to address the root causes of overbidding and other challenges in the sector. More efforts are needed to address issues such as child labor and low prices, which continue to plague the cocoa industry in Ivory Coast and other cocoa-producing countries.\nRegardless, the revised electronic auction rules are a significant achievement for the country's cocoa sector and represent a positive step forward in efforts to improve working conditions and the lives of cocoa farmers.", "USAir announced today that they are cancelling their marketing agreement with British Airways, citing a lack of cooperation from the British airline. The move is seen as further straining the partnership between the two airlines, which has been on shaky ground for some time.\nThe decision to cancel the marketing agreement was made after months of negotiations between the two companies. USAir had been seeking greater collaboration from British Airways on key issues such as route planning, pricing strategy and marketing initiatives. However, they were unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with the British carrier.\nIn a statement released today, USAir\u2019s CEO, Robert Isom, said: \u201cWe have been in discussions with British Airways for some time now, seeking greater cooperation and collaboration between our two airlines. Unfortunately, we have been unable to find common ground on key issues and have therefore made the difficult decision to cancel our marketing agreement.\u201d\nThe cancellation of the marketing agreement is seen as a significant blow to both airlines, as it represents a significant portion of their respective marketing budgets. USAir and British Airways have both been struggling in recent years, as the global aviation industry has been hit hard by rising fuel prices and increasing competition from low-cost carriers.\nThe decision to cancel the marketing agreement is also likely to have a negative impact on both airlines\u2019 passenger numbers. USAir and British Airways had been hoping to attract more passengers to their respective networks through joint marketing initiatives and promotional campaigns. However, with the marketing agreement now cancelled, this is likely to become more difficult.\nThe move is also likely to place further strain on the partnership between USAir and British Airways. The two airlines have been increasingly at odds in recent years, as they have struggled to find common ground on key issues such as pricing strategy and route planning. The cancellation of the marketing agreement is likely to exacerbate these tensions and could lead to further disagreements in the future.\nDespite the cancellation of the marketing agreement, both USAir and British Airways have pledged to continue their partnership in other areas. The two airlines will continue to operate joint flights between the USA and the UK, and will work together to ensure a smooth transition for passengers affected by the cancellation of the marketing agreement.\nIn a statement released today, British Airways said: \u201cWe are disappointed by USAir\u2019s decision to cancel our marketing agreement, but we remain committed to working with them in other areas. We will continue to operate joint flights between the USA and the UK, and will work with USAir to ensure that our passengers continue to receive the highest levels of service.\u201d\nThe cancellation of the marketing agreement is a blow to both USAir and British Airways, as it represents a significant portion of their respective marketing budgets. However, both airlines remain committed to working together in other areas and will continue to operate joint flights between the USA and the UK.", "US-based conglomerate 3M has reported a 16% jump in earnings for the first quarter of 2021 after spinning off its slow-growing data storage and imaging businesses. The company's stock rose by more than 2% in pre-market trading on Thursday after it beat Wall Street expectations on earnings and sales.\nIn a press release, 3M said it had earned $2.7bn, or $4.59 per share, in the first quarter of 2021, up from $2.3bn, or $3.88 per share, in the same period last year. The company's revenue rose by 9.6% to $8.9bn in the quarter, beating analysts' estimates of $8.4bn.\nThe report showed that the company's sales grew across all its businesses, led by a 13% increase in its healthcare unit, which saw strong demand for its medical masks and respirators due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company's transportation and electronics business also grew by 7%, driven by demand for automotive and consumer electronics products.\n3M's CEO Mike Roman said in a statement that the results showed the company's \"continued focus on innovation and operational execution\", adding that he was \"pleased with the improvements we're seeing across the portfolio\".\nOne factor behind the company's impressive results was the spin-off of its data storage and imaging businesses, which were slow-growing and dragging down its overall profitability. In March 2021, 3M completed the sale of these businesses to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for $1.7bn.\nThe move was part of 3M's broader restructuring efforts aimed at focusing on faster-growing and more profitable businesses, such as healthcare, transportation, and consumer electronics. The company also plans to invest more in research and development to drive innovation and growth in these areas.\nSome analysts have praised 3M's strategy, saying it will help the company improve its profitability and competitiveness in the long term. \"There's no question 3M needed to get rid of those businesses,\" said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, in an interview with Reuters. \"They were basically a drain on the company.\"\nHowever, other analysts have expressed concerns that 3M's reliance on its healthcare business, which accounted for 23% of its sales in the first quarter, could be risky, given that demand for medical masks and equipment is likely to decline as the pandemic subsides.\n\"This performance is going to be hard to sustain,\" said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in an interview with the Financial Times. \"As the pandemic comes under control, we're going to see a shift in end markets, and that's where the vulnerability is.\"\nDespite these concerns, 3M remains optimistic about its future prospects, saying it expects to continue growing its businesses and improving profitability in the coming years. The company has set a target of achieving organic sales growth of 4% to 6% per year, and a return on invested capital of around 20%.\n\"We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong performance and sustainable growth over the long term,\" Roman said in the statement.\nOverall, 3M's impressive earnings report is a positive sign for the company and its investors, who have seen the stock rise by more than 17% this year. With its focus on faster-growing and more profitable businesses, 3M looks set to continue to outperform its competitors and deliver value to its shareholders.", "China's government is seeking $20 billion in foreign investment by 2000 to help fund its ambitious power expansion projects. China's investment climate is strong, and its power sector has been growing at an astonishing rate over the past decade. The country's leadership has set a goal of producing 680 million kilowatts (kw) of installed power capacity by 2000, up from the 150 million kW in 1985.\nChina's leaders understand the crucial role that foreign investors play in achieving its goal of expanding power capacity to meet the demands of its rapidly growing economy. Investment from foreign companies has already played a significant role in China's power sector, with many companies taking advantage of China's abundant natural resources and vast potential for renewable energy.\nChina's investment climate is also strong, with stable economic conditions providing investors with a sense of security. According to a recent report from the World Bank, China remains the world's largest recipient of foreign direct investment, attracting $150 billion in 2020 alone.\nTo achieve its goal of $20 billion in foreign investment, the Chinese government is opening up more of its power sector to foreign investors. This includes the establishment of joint ventures and the development of new power generating projects that are open to foreign participation. The government has also outlined a range of attractive incentives, including tax holidays and speedier approvals for foreign investment projects.\nForeign investment in China's power sector has the potential to bring significant economic benefits to the country. Not only will it help to expand power capacity and meet the demands of its growing economy, but it will also provide opportunities for local businesses to support the sector. This includes the development of new industries and jobs related to renewable energy.\nChina's move to open up its power sector to foreign investment is indicative of its continued commitment to attracting international capital and expanding its economy. By working with foreign investors, China can take advantage of the latest technologies and expertise to increase efficiency and improve the quality of its power supply. For investors, China's strong investment climate and expanding power sector represent a significant opportunity to take part in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.", "Toronto, Canada: The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Index reached a new high today, closing above the 5600 mark for the first time ever. This is the 50th record close this year alone, a testament to the strength of Canada's economy. The overall market is up over 23% in 1996, outpacing many other developed markets around the world.\nThe TSE's 300 Index is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the largest 300 companies trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It is considered a benchmark index for Canada's stock market and is closely watched by investors both in Canada and globally.\nToday's closing figure of 5623.92 is the highest ever for the TSE's 300 Index. The previous high was set on November 22, 1996, when the index closed at 5575.06. The market has been on an upward trend for most of the year, buoyed by strong economic growth in Canada and rising commodity prices.\nOne major driver of the market's success has been the technology sector. Companies like BlackBerry and Shopify have seen their shares surge this year as investors bet on their growth potential. The financial sector has also performed strongly, with banks like Royal Bank of Canada and TD Bank reporting solid earnings and growing their dividends.\nCanada's economic growth has been one of the strongest among developed countries, with GDP growth forecast to reach 3.1% in 2017, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This growth has been fueled by strong consumer spending and a rebound in commodity prices, which have benefited Canada's resource-heavy economy.\n\"Canada's economy continues to perform well, and this is reflected in the stock market's strong performance,\" said John Smith, a senior analyst at TD Securities. \"Investors are optimistic about Canada's prospects and are looking for opportunities to invest in the nation's growing economy.\"\nDespite the strong performance of the Canadian stock market this year, some analysts warn that there are risks ahead. The current bull market has been going on for almost nine years, and some worry that a correction is overdue. Additionally, rising interest rates in the US could hurt the Canadian economy, as it would make it more expensive for Canadians to borrow money.\nFor now, however, investors are enjoying the ride and looking forward to what 2018 will bring for Canada's economy and stock market.", "The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) announced yesterday that it will be changing its rules governing control blocks, a move that will have a significant impact on large-cap Canadian stocks.\nThe new rules will require any company that owns a control block of shares to have a majority of independent directors on its board. A control block is defined as a holding of more than 20% of issued and outstanding voting shares.\nThis change is part of the TSX\u2019s efforts to improve corporate governance and increase transparency in the market. The TSX believes that having a majority of independent directors on the board will ensure that all shareholders are treated fairly and that the company is run in the best interest of its stakeholders.\nThe TSX has been working on this rule change for several months in consultation with stakeholders and industry experts. This change is expected to come into effect later this year.\n\u201cThis is an important step forward for the TSX as we seek to enhance the quality of our markets and ensure that issuers comply with the highest standards of corporate governance,\u201d said Lou Eccleston, CEO of the TMX Group, which owns the TSX.\nThe rule change is expected to affect a number of large-cap Canadian stocks. Many of these companies have control blocks owned by founding families, which will now have to ensure that they have a majority of independent directors on their boards.\nSome experts predict that this rule change will lead to increased activism among shareholders, who may see this as an opportunity to push for changes in the governance of these companies.\n\u201cInvestors will now have more power to push for improved governance and greater transparency at companies with control blocks,\u201d said Sandra Levy, a corporate governance expert at Schulich School of Business.\nThere are concerns, however, that this rule change may lead to less liquidity in the market, as some of these founding families may be reluctant to sell their stakes and dilute their control.\n\u201cWe could see a situation where these founding families become even more entrenched and less willing to give up control,\u201d said John Smith, a securities lawyer with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\nDespite these concerns, many industry experts believe that this rule change is a positive step for the TSX and for Canadian companies.\n\u201cThis is a welcome development for the Canadian market, which has been criticized in the past for lax governance standards,\u201d said Levy.\nThe TSX has made significant strides in improving the quality of its markets in recent years. In 2017, it introduced a new rule requiring issuers to have a majority of independent directors on their boards, and it has since implemented several other initiatives aimed at improving corporate governance and increasing transparency.\nThe TSX\u2019s rule change on control blocks is the latest in a series of measures aimed at making Canadian companies more accountable to their shareholders and ensuring that the market operates fairly and efficiently.", "Netscape Communications Corp. revealed a low-cost version of its software for corporate networks on Monday to help the company compete in a crowded market with rival Microsoft Corp.\nThe new software, called Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0, bundles several applications designed to help businesses manage email, Internet access and corporate intranets. Netscape SuiteSpot 3.0 is priced at $1,295 per server, the lowest price point for the company's software for corporate networks.\nNetscape's move comes as it faces increasing pressure from market leader Microsoft. According to the latest figures from International Data Corp., Microsoft held a commanding lead in the corporate server software market with 40 percent market share in 1997, while Netscape had only 8 percent.\nNetscape also announced a strategic alliance with Microsoft in a bid to expand its market. Under the alliance, Microsoft agreed to bundle Netscape's Netcaster software with its Internet Explorer browser, while Netscape will provide support for Microsoft's ActiveX technology in future products.\nAnalysts believe Netscape's move into the low-cost, entry-level server software market could help the company compete with Microsoft while also widening its customer base.\n\"Netscape is aiming to capture the entry point of the market with this low-cost product,\" said Neil Macehiter, an analyst at Ovum, a London-based research firm. \"It's an important offering for the company to have, as it leverages the strength of Netscape's core technology at a more affordable price point.\"\nNetscape CEO and chairman Jim Barksdale said in a statement that the new software is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses take advantage of the benefits of corporate networks without the high cost.\n\"With SuiteSpot 3.0, we are giving customers greater control over their networks, while letting them reap the benefits of Internet and intranet-based computing at a price that's affordable for even the smallest businesses,\" he said.\nNetscape SuiteSpot 3.0 is designed to work with a variety of operating systems, including Windows NT, Sun Solaris and IBM AIX. It includes a range of tools to manage corporate email, Internet access and intranet-based collaboration. The software also includes support for SSL encryption and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tunneling to help safeguard corporate data.\nNetscape's strategic alliance with Microsoft comes as the two companies continue to compete in the browser market. Microsoft's Internet Explorer holds a commanding lead in the market, with Netscape Navigator losing market share since 1997. The two companies have also clashed over the use of Java technology, with Microsoft's own version of Java being incompatible with Netscape's.\nDespite their rivalry, Netscape executives believe the strategic alliance will help the company increase sales of its products while also expanding Microsoft's browser offerings.\n\"We view this as an opportunity to broaden our product line and increase the reach of our technology,\" said Netscape president and chief operating officer Mike Homer in a statement. \"Our customers have been asking for a choice of browser, and we're pleased to be working with Microsoft to provide them with that choice.\"\nMicrosoft executives also welcomed the alliance, with group vice president Bob Muglia calling it a \"good step for customers\" in a statement.\n\"This agreement will give customers a convenient way to obtain a choice of Web browsers from industry leaders,\" he said. \"We believe that offering customers a choice of browsers is important, and we're excited to be working with Netscape on this effort.\"\nNetscape's move into the low-cost server market and its alliance with Microsoft are seen as key steps toward helping the company compete with its larger rival while also expanding its customer base. For small businesses looking to take advantage of corporate networks and intranet-based applications, SuiteSpot 3.0 could be an affordable option, while Microsoft's decision to bundle Netscape's Netcaster software with Internet Explorer could help expand its presence in the browser market.\nAs competition in the market continues to heat up, both companies are likely to continue to innovate and collaborate in their efforts to meet the needs of their customers and outmaneuver each other in the battle for market dominance.", "Central and Eastern European bourses recently experienced an upturn in share prices, with investors flocking to markets in Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Czech Republic, among others. Unfortunately, the euphoria was short-lived and markets have since taken a downturn once again, signaling ongoing global economic uncertainty.\nThe ascent began in early 2021, with the Hungarian Stock Exchange seeing a 6% increase in just the first month of the year. By April, the Warsaw Stock Exchange had led the region with a 13% increase year-to-date, while the Prague Stock Exchange and the Bucharest Stock Exchange recorded gains of 8% and 6% respectively.\nWhile some analysts credited increased domestic economic growth and the decrease in COVID-19 cases as a factor, others believe that the gains were largely attributed to investors searching for higher yields in a low-interest-rate environment.\nThe overall sentiments in the region changed drastically after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that they may raise interest rates in the near future. This caused investors to once again rotate their portfolios and move out of stocks and into fixed income securities. Concerns around rising inflation and its impact on the market also contributed to the downturn.\nThe impact of market volatility was felt widely, with major companies like the Hungarian oil company MOL and the Polish energy group PGE seeing their share prices decline by 8% and 6% respectively within just one week. Similarly, the Prague-based lender Moneta Money Bank experienced a drop of 7% in its shares.\nDespite the recent setbacks, Central European bourses have proven to be relatively resilient throughout the pandemic, performing notably better than other emerging markets like Turkey and South Africa. In fact, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has recently been included in the FTSE All-World index, signifying its growing importance in the global investment arena.\nHowever, analysts remain cautious and warn investors of the potential risks that lie ahead. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to loom heavily on the markets, with setbacks seen in places like Greece, which has reintroduced lockdown measures amidst a surge in cases. The challenges of vaccine rollouts in the region also pose a hurdle to economic growth.\nPolitical tensions may also have an impact on market stability. The Hungarian government's increasing authoritarianism has come under scrutiny from EU officials, while the Slovakian government is in the midst of a political crisis, with the resignation of Prime Minister Igor Matovic in March.\nThe region has also been hit hard by a recent cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the United States, which caused fuel shortages and price spikes in countries like Hungary. Inflation in the region is expected to rise rapidly as a result, further eroding any gains in share prices.\nIn addition, the region faces longer-term challenges in the form of the slow pace of reforms and innovation. Many Central and Eastern European countries are still heavily reliant on traditional industries like manufacturing, and find it difficult to compete in a rapidly changing global market.\nIn order to address these issues, European Union officials are pushing for closer integration and cooperation between the member states. The EU's Recovery and Resilience Facility, which will funnel billions of euros into projects aimed at improving the economic and social infrastructure of the region, is seen as a step in the right direction.\nWhile the recent upturn in share prices in Central and Eastern Europe was short-lived, the underlying trends in the region suggest that it has the potential for long-term growth. However, investors must be aware of the short-term risks and volatility that comes with emerging markets.", "Mou Qizhong, the second richest man in China, is facing some rough times. The businessman is reportedly being hounded by creditors and investigated for irregularities.\nMou Qizhong is a well-known entrepreneur in China. He is the founder and former chairman of the Suning Commerce Group, one of the largest retailers in China. As the second richest man in the country, he has a net worth of $13.2 billion, according to Forbes.\nHowever, Mou Qizhong's fortunes seem to be turning sour. The businessman is facing mounting pressure from creditors, who are reportedly seeking to force him to repay debts owed to them.\nOne of the creditors is China Minsheng Banking Corp, which has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Mou Qizhong in a Shanghai court. The bank is said to be seeking the repayment of a loan of 1.5 billion yuan ($230 million) that it extended to Mou's private investment vehicle.\nOther creditors are reportedly taking similar action against Mou Qizhong, who is said to be struggling with a liquidity crunch. It is unclear how much total debt the businessman owes to creditors.\nThe mounting pressure from creditors is not the only problem facing Mou Qizhong. The businessman is also reportedly being investigated for irregularities by Chinese authorities.\nAccording to media reports, Mou Qizhong is being investigated by China's top anti-corruption agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. The investigation is said to be focused on the businessman's tenure as chairman of Suning Commerce Group.\nIt is unclear what specific irregularities the investigation is targeting, but reports suggest that it could be related to allegations of embezzlement and lax corporate governance.\nThe investigation into Mou Qizhong's conduct comes as Chinese authorities continue their crackdown on corruption and white-collar crime. The Chinese government has made the fight against corruption a top priority in recent years, and has pursued numerous high-profile cases against officials and businesspeople.\nThe investigation into Mou Qizhong's conduct is also likely to have wider implications for the Chinese business community. The Suning Commerce Group is one of China's largest retailers, and Mou Qizhong is a prominent figure in the country's business world.\nThe investigation into Mou Qizhong's conduct comes as China's economy is slowing down. The country's trade war with the United States has dented economic growth, and many Chinese businesses are facing uncertainty.\nThe mounting pressure on Mou Qizhong is likely to increase concerns among investors about the health of the Chinese economy. The businessman's troubles are also likely to be seen as a warning sign for other Chinese entrepreneurs, who may be facing similar problems.\nDespite the mounting pressure on Mou Qizhong, the businessman has remained defiant. In a statement released to the media, Mou Qizhong denied any wrongdoing and said that he would defend himself against the allegations.\n\"I have always acted within the law and will resolutely safeguard my own legitimate rights and interests,\" he said.\nMou Qizhong also sought to reassure investors about the state of his business empire, saying that the Suning Commerce Group was \"healthy and stable.\"\nHowever, the mounting pressure on Mou Qizhong is likely to be a cause for concern for investors, who may be worried about the impact of his troubles on the wider Chinese economy. The businessman's troubles also highlight the ongoing challenges facing China's business community, as it seeks to navigate an uncertain economic and political landscape.", "The Czech Republic's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for this year has been revised down to 3.1%, from its previous forecast of 3.6%, due to decreased export demand from Germany.\nThe Czech economy has been heavily reliant on exports to Germany, which accounts for approximately one-third of the country's total exports. However, Germany's economy, which is the largest in Europe, has been struggling in recent months due to a slowdown in global trade and the ongoing trade dispute with the United States.\nThe decrease in demand for Czech goods and services from Germany is, therefore, having a significant impact on the country's economy, particularly in the manufacturing and automotive sectors.\nThe revised forecast was released by the Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday. The bank's governor, Jiri Rusnok, stated that the revision was due to \"a significant slowdown in foreign demand, primarily from Germany.\"\nThe bank's report also noted that there had been a decline in the growth of domestic demand, which had previously been a driving force behind the country's economic growth. The report cited rising inflation and a shrinking labour market as key factors contributing to this decline.\nIn response to the revised forecast, the Czech government has announced that it will be taking steps to support the country's economy. These measures include a new economic stimulus package aimed at boosting investment, as well as increased government spending on infrastructure projects.\nThe government has also called on the European Union to take action to address the trade tensions between the EU and the US, as well as the ongoing dispute with China.\n\"We need to make sure that our exporters have access to new markets and are not overly reliant on one particular country,\" said Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis in a statement released on Tuesday.\nThe news of the revised GDP growth forecast has been met with concern by businesses and investors in the Czech Republic. The country's stock market has seen a decline in recent days, with shares in major companies such as Skoda Auto and Pilsner Urquell dropping significantly.\nSome analysts have also expressed concern that the downward trend in economic growth could lead to a rise in unemployment and a decrease in consumer spending, which could have further negative impacts on the economy.\nDespite these challenges, however, there are also some positive signs for the Czech economy. The country remains one of the fastest-growing economies in the EU, and there are indications that the government's stimulus measures could help to boost growth in the short term.\nIn addition, the CNB has announced that it will maintain its current monetary policy, which includes keeping interest rates low and allowing the Czech koruna to float freely against other currencies. This policy is intended to support economic growth and maintain price stability.\nOverall, the revised GDP growth forecast is a reminder of the challenges facing the Czech economy in the current global economic climate. While there are reasons for both concern and optimism, it is clear that continued efforts will be needed to support the country's economic growth and help it to navigate a challenging and uncertain global trade environment.", "Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, is expecting a significant drop in cocoa arrivals this year. According to industry sources, the country is likely to record a 25% decline in cocoa arrivals this season, due to erratic weather patterns as well as pest and insect infestations that have plagued the production of cocoa beans across major producing regions.\nCocoa has been at the heart of Ivory Coast's agricultural exports for decades, and the country accounts for about 40% of global cocoa supplies. Cocoa exports from Ivory Coast support over seven million people, including farmers and their families, traders, processors, and exporters.\nThe country's cocoa sector is also a significant contributor to the country's GDP, generating over 20% of the country's total exports and creating jobs for millions of Ivorians. However, the decline in cocoa production is alarming, and it could have far-reaching implications on the Ivorian economy and the global supply of cocoa.\nIndustry experts have attributed the production decline to several factors, including erratic weather, insect damage, and inadequate government support for the cocoa sector. The country has been experiencing abnormally dry weather patterns this year, increasing the risk of crop failures and pests.\nIn addition, the country's cocoa farms have been under threat from a range of pests and diseases, including the cocoa pod borer, which attacks young cocoa pods, causing them to wither and drop off prematurely. The pest has caused substantial damage to cocoa crops across the country, exacerbating the already dire situation.\nMoreover, experts warn that the country's cocoa sector is under-resourced and needs more government support to address the challenges facing cocoa production. The government has been slow to invest in research and development, and there have been few initiatives to train farmers on best practices or provide them with the tools and resources to combat pests and diseases.\nThe decline in cocoa production is already being felt across the sector, with farmers hit the hardest. The reduced yields will mean that many cocoa farmers will struggle to make ends meet and may have to abandon their farms altogether, further exacerbating the cocoa production crisis. Reduced cocoa production could also have serious social impacts on the country, given the high dependence of communities on cocoa farming.\nThe Ivorian government has announced several measures to deal with the declining cocoa production, including the distribution of pesticides and fertilizers to farmers to help address the pest infestations. The government has also called on cocoa farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices and diversify their agriculture towards other crops.\nThe government has also stated that it will take steps to stabilize cocoa prices, thereby shielding farmers from the market volatility that often accompanies declining cocoa production. The government has promised to strengthen its campaigns to encourage farmers to implement sustainable farming practices, such as agroforestry and shade-grown farming, to help protect their cocoa farms and increase productivity.\nThe government has recognized the magnitude of the problem and has taken steps to address the root causes of the decline in cocoa production. However, it remains to be seen whether these measures will be enough to support the sector and restore the production of cocoa.\nThe current situation highlights the importance of sustainability and the need for governments, cocoa buyers, and other stakeholders to support farmers in adopting sustainable farming practices. Cocoa production requires long-term planning and interventions, and support from all stakeholders in the sector is crucial to ensuring the sustainability and profitability of cocoa farming in Ivory Coast.\nThe cocoa production crisis in the country also highlights the need for more significant investments in research and development in the sector, as well as the need for coordinated efforts to address the challenges facing cocoa production, such as climate change, pests, and diseases.\nIn conclusion, Ivory Coast's cocoa sector is facing significant challenges as it grapples with declining cocoa production due to erratic weather and insect damage. The Ivorian government's efforts to support cocoa farmers and stabilize cocoa prices are commendable, but the challenges facing the industry require a long-term commitment to sustainable cocoa production and the collective effort of all stakeholders in the sector.", "Abidjan, Ivory Coast - The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) gathered in Abidjan, Ivory Coast this week for its annual meeting to discuss the troubling trend of low world coffee prices. Representatives from 25 African coffee producing countries attended the conference, along with industry experts and economists.\nIACO Secretary-General, Josefa Sacko, opened the conference by highlighting the current state of the coffee industry. \"The coffee sector is facing hard times with low coffee prices impacting the incomes of millions of families across Africa,\" she said.\nThe conference focused on the need for greater cooperation among coffee-producing countries to address the issue of low prices, which are largely due to an oversupply of coffee beans on the world market. The growing popularity of alternative beverages such as tea, as well as changing consumer preferences, have also contributed to the decline in coffee prices.\nDelegates discussed the possibility of introducing measures to stabilize the market, such as the creation of a common fund for coffee farmers or the establishment of a minimum price for coffee beans. However, many experts pointed out that such measures would require the cooperation of major coffee producing countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Vietnam, which are not currently involved in the discussions.\nIACO also focused on the importance of improving the quality of African coffee to increase demand and command a higher price. The organization plans to work with smallholder coffee farmers to provide training and support in good agricultural practices, as well as help them access international markets.\nThe conference also addressed issues related to climate change, which has significant implications for coffee production in Africa. Droughts, severe weather conditions, and the spread of pests and diseases are all affecting coffee quality and quantity. IACO emphasized the importance of adopting climate-smart practices to promote sustainable coffee production.\nThe conference concluded with a call for greater collaboration and coordination among African coffee producing countries, as well as with the international community to address the issue of low coffee prices. \"The coffee industry plays a critical role in the economies of many African countries,\" said Sacko. \"We must work together to ensure that the sector remains sustainable and benefits farmers and communities for generations to come.\"", "China has been once again in the headlines as prominent dissident Wang Dan is currently facing trial on accusations of plotting to overthrow the Chinese government. He was one of the key student leaders during the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square, which led to a brutal crackdown by the Chinese authorities. Wang, who is now based in the United States, has been a vocal critic of China's human rights record and has been actively campaigning for political reforms in the country for decades.\nThe Chinese government has accused Wang of conspiring with some other overseas activists to overthrow the Communist Party and establish a democratic regime in China. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Wang has denied the allegations and said that he has been targeted for his political activities. He also criticized the Chinese government for its crackdown on free speech and civil society.\n\"My protest has always been peaceful, and I have never advocated violence,\" Wang said in a statement released through his lawyer. \"I believe that the Chinese people have the right to choose their own leaders and live in a free and democratic society. I have been targeted for my beliefs, and I will continue to speak out against oppression and injustice.\"\nWang's trial coincides with the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, which remains one of the darkest chapters in Chinese history. On June 4, 1989, protestors, mostly students and intellectuals, gathered in the central Beijing square to demand political reforms and an end to corruption. However, the Chinese government declared martial law and deployed the People's Liberation Army to crush the protests. The exact number of casualties remains unknown, but estimates range from hundreds to thousands.\nWang was one of the student leaders during the Tiananmen Square protests and was arrested along with other activists in the aftermath. He spent four years in prison before being released in 1993. However, he was arrested again in 1995 on charges of subversion and sentenced to 11 years in prison. He was released in 1998 and went into exile in the United States, where he has continued his activism.\nMany human rights groups and Western governments have condemned the Chinese government's treatment of Wang and other dissidents. They have called for his immediate release and said that the charges against him are politically motivated. The US State Department issued a statement in support of Wang and other political prisoners in China.\n\"We call on the Chinese government to release Wang Dan and all other political prisoners and to respect the human rights of all Chinese citizens,\" the statement read. \"We urge the Chinese authorities to provide Wang Dan with a fair trial and transparent legal proceedings in accordance with international standards.\"\nChina has rejected these allegations and said that it is a sovereign country that is entitled to take action against anyone who tries to undermine its national security and stability. China has also accused Western governments of interfering in its internal affairs and using human rights as a pretext to justify their political and economic interests.\nThe trial of Wang Dan is expected to last for several weeks, and the outcome is uncertain. However, the case is likely to further strain China's relations with the United States and other Western countries, which have already been tense due to other issues such as trade and technology. It also underscores the ongoing struggle between the Chinese government and its critics over the direction of China's political and social development.", "In a bid to boost its economy and attract more foreign investors, the Chinese autonomous region of Tibet recently announced unprecedented privileges for foreign investors in the region. The move comes as China continues to open up its economy to the world, and as Tibet seeks to tap into the international business community for investment and development opportunities.\nAccording to the new policy, foreign investors will be granted a series of incentives and benefits to help them establish and grow their businesses in Tibet. These include preferential tax treatment, streamlined bureaucratic procedures, and easier access to funding and capital. Additionally, the new policy offers a series of special measures designed to help foreign investors navigate the unique challenges and opportunities of doing business in Tibet.\nAmong the most significant of these special measures is a new program to facilitate the hiring of Tibetan workers by foreign companies. As part of the program, foreign companies will receive financial rewards and other incentives for hiring Tibetan workers, who are often skilled in areas such as tourism, agriculture, and traditional handicrafts. This is seen as a win-win for both foreign investors and Tibet, as it will provide much-needed jobs and training opportunities for local people, while also helping foreign firms tap into the region's unique cultural and economic strengths.\nAnother key feature of the policy is a focus on promoting sustainable and environmentally-friendly development in the region. To this end, foreign investors will be granted support and funding to invest in renewable energy, green technology, and other sustainable development projects. At the same time, the policy also includes strong measures to protect the region's delicate ecosystem and biodiversity, and to ensure that foreign investment does not harm the local environment.\nSpeaking at a press conference to announce the new policy, a spokesperson for the Tibet Autonomous Region government said that the move was aimed at \"creating a globally competitive investment environment\" for foreign investors, while also helping to drive sustainable economic development in the region. The spokesperson also emphasized that Tibet was committed to fostering international cooperation and engagement, and to \"building a harmonious society, based on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and win-win cooperation\".\nReaction to the policy has been largely positive, with many experts and analysts hailing it as a significant step forward for Tibet's economic development. Some observers have noted that the new policy is a sign that China is becoming more willing to open up its regional economies to foreign investment, in an effort to stimulate growth and compete with other countries in the region.\nOthers have praised the focus on sustainability and environmental protection, noting that these are key issues for both investors and local communities in many parts of the world. Many have also lauded the program to promote hiring of local workers, saying that this will help to create jobs and stimulate economic development in rural and remote areas of Tibet.\nAt the same time, there have been some concerns raised about the practical issues involved in implementing the new policy, and whether it will be successful in attracting the kind of large-scale foreign investment that Tibet is hoping for. Some have noted that there are still significant challenges to doing business in the region, including issues related to infrastructure, logistics, and connectivity. Others have pointed out that there is still some uncertainty around the regulatory framework for foreign investment in Tibet, and that the government will need to provide more detailed guidance and support to ensure that foreign investors are able to navigate these challenges successfully.\nDespite these concerns, however, many observers remain optimistic about the future of foreign investment in Tibet, and about the potential for the region to become a major hub for international business and commerce. With its rich cultural heritage, unique natural environment, and growing infrastructure and connectivity, Tibet is seen as a key player in China's ambitious plans to become a global economic power. And with its new policy of providing unprecedented privileges and incentives to foreign investors, the region is sending a strong signal that it is open for business, and ready to take advantage of the opportunities that come with a more connected and globalized world.", "According to the latest statistics, China's economy has grown by 9.6 percent in the first quarter of 2021. Despite the global pandemic and its effects, China's economy continues to expand rapidly. However, despite the overall economic growth, urban family incomes are still lagging behind.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics released a report on April 16th, indicating that the Gross Domestic Product has reached 24.93 trillion yuan ($3.82 trillion) in the first quarter of the year. This shows a significant increase of 18.3% year-on-year. The growth has been attributed to the rise in exports, industrial output, and retail sales.\nChina's economy has been boosted by favorable policies, including tax cuts, infrastructure construction, and technological advancements. The country has also managed to keep a steady recovery rate, while the global economy has suffered greatly from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite this significant growth, urban family incomes remain stagnant. The report shows that the per capita disposable income of urban residents declined by 0.3% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021. This is the first time in over a decade that there has been a decline in urban incomes.\nThe findings show that the urban-rural income gap in China continues to widen, as income growth in rural areas has outstripped that in urban areas. The per capita disposable income of rural residents grew by 13.1%, while the corresponding income for urban residents rose by only 3.5%.\nExperts have predicted that the stagnant income growth in urban areas could be attributed to the pandemic's effects on the service sector. The service industry is a considerable contributor to the urban economy, but it has been hit hard by the pandemic. Many urban residents also face higher living costs, such as housing rents, healthcare, and education fees.\nSeveral measures have been implemented to address the issue of sluggish income growth for urban families. In 2020, the State Council issued a plan to increase the disposable income of urban residents. The plan aims to provide tax cuts, subsidies, and promote employment.\nThe government has also taken steps to increase the income of low-income groups, such as migrant workers and young people. Several cities have introduced minimum wage levels to ensure that workers receive a basic wage, and the government has provided subsidies to support small and medium-sized businesses.\nDespite these efforts, the income growth gap between urban and rural areas continues to widen. The government's efforts to reduce inequality have not kept up with the pace of China's economic expansion. Income inequality is a longstanding issue in China, and it has been a focus of the government's attention for several years.\nThe government's targets to eliminate poverty in rural areas have been successful, but the focus now needs to shift to urban areas and income inequality. In addition to the existing efforts, the government can also consider implementing policies such as increasing the minimum wage and improving the social welfare system.\nA fair and equitable distribution of wealth is essential for sustainable economic growth. The Chinese government needs to recognize the importance of achieving this goal and take necessary steps to address the issue. If urban incomes continue to lag behind, it could lead to discontent among the population and hinder the country's progress.\nIn conclusion, China's economy has grown significantly in 2021's first quarter. However, urban family incomes have not kept pace with the overall economic growth. Income inequality remains a significant issue that needs to be addressed. The Chinese government must focus on policies that address the income gap, which will benefit both urban and rural residents and achieve sustainable economic growth.", "Compaq Computer Corp, one of the world's largest manufacturers of personal computers, has lost a key executive to an internet startup. Mark Wills, a top executive at Compaq, has left his position to become president and CEO of pcOrder.com, an e-commerce company based in Austin, Texas. The move is a significant blow to Compaq, which has been struggling to maintain its dominance in the PC industry amid fierce competition from competitors such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\nWills, who had been with Compaq for 15 years, was widely seen as a rising star in the company. He had most recently served as senior vice president of global enterprise sales and services, overseeing Compaq's largest customers, including corporations, governments, and educational institutions.\nIn his new role at pcOrder.com, Wills will be responsible for leading the company's efforts to expand its e-commerce platform, which enables businesses to order technology products and services online. The company serves a range of industries, including healthcare, education, and government.\n\"pcOrder.com is at the forefront of innovation in the e-commerce space, and I'm excited to be joining such a talented and dedicated team,\" Wills said in a statement. \"Our goal is to empower businesses with the tools and technology they need to succeed in a rapidly changing digital landscape.\"\nThe news of Wills' departure has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with many analysts speculating about the impact it could have on Compaq's business. While the company has been making strides to diversify its product portfolio, including recent investments in cloud computing and cybersecurity, the loss of a top executive could hamper those efforts.\n\"Compaq has been struggling to adapt to the changing dynamics of the PC industry, and losing someone of Mark Wills' caliber is a significant setback,\" said Timothy Lajer, an industry analyst with Gartner Inc. \"It remains to be seen how the company will respond, but it's clear that they will need to find a way to keep pace with the competition.\"\nCompaq, which was founded in 1982, rose to prominence in the 1990s as one of the leading PC manufacturers in the world. The company was known for its innovative products and aggressive marketing strategies, which helped it capture a large share of the market.\nHowever, in recent years, Compaq has struggled to maintain its market share amid fierce competition from companies such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Sales of PCs have also been declining, as consumers increasingly turn to smartphones and tablets for their computing needs.\nTo stay competitive, Compaq has been making strategic investments, including recent acquisitions of companies in the cloud computing and cybersecurity markets. The company has also been focusing on its services business, which includes consulting, support, and financing for its customers.\nDespite these efforts, Compaq has continued to struggle with declining sales and profits. In the most recent quarter, the company reported a 4% decline in revenue compared to the same period last year, with net income falling by 19%.\nThe departure of Mark Wills is likely to further complicate Compaq's efforts to turn its business around. The company will now need to find a way to replace one of its top executives while also making progress on its strategic goals.\nFor pcOrder.com, Wills' appointment is a major coup. The company has been growing rapidly in recent years, with revenues increasing by 65% in 2020. With Wills at the helm, the company is well-positioned to continue its expansion into new markets and industries.\n\"Mark Wills is a proven leader with a track record of success in the tech industry,\" said John McMillan, chairman of pcOrder.com. \"We're excited to have him on board and look forward to working with him to take our business to the next level.\"\nThe news of Wills' departure is a reminder that the tech industry is constantly in flux, with new companies emerging and established players struggling to adapt. For Compaq, the loss of a top executive is a setback, but the company's long history of innovation and resilience suggests that it will find a way to navigate the challenges ahead. As for pcOrder.com, the appointment of Mark Wills is a sign that the company is well-positioned to seize opportunities in the fast-changing world of e-commerce.", "Hewlett-Packard (HP) has announced that it is set to unveil a new device that is aimed at revolutionizing the way people copy documents.

Both players had been performing strongly in the tournament up until their defeats, with Ferreira ranked third in the world and Martin ranked fifth.\nFerreira's match against the 12th seed, Petrovic, was a shock upset for many fans and analysts. Petrovic's aggressive play style proved too much for Ferreira, who struggled to keep up with his opponent's powerful serves and baseline shots. Despite a strong start in the first set, Ferreira quickly found himself trailing as Petrovic managed to break his serve multiple times. Ferreira fought hard in the second set, but his efforts were in vain as Petrovic held on to his lead and closed out the match 6-3, 6-4.\nMartin's quarterfinal match against the unseeded player, Kovac, was also a disappointment for the fans. Kovac, who had fought his way through qualifying rounds to reach the quarterfinals, proved to be a formidable opponent for Martin. Like Ferreira, Martin struggled to handle Kovac's powerful serves and had trouble finding his rhythm on the court. While Martin put up a good fight in the first set, he was unable to break Kovac's serve and lost it 6-4. The second set saw Martin become more frustrated and tense, which only seemed to feed Kovac's confidence. Kovac broke Martin's serve twice in the set, earning himself a 6-2 win and a spot in the semifinals.\nThe losses of Ferreira and Martin have opened up the field at the Czech Indoor Open, leaving many fans wondering who will walk away with the championship trophy. Petrovic and Kovac will face off in the semifinals, while the other semifinal match will be between the top seed, Novak, and the eighth seed, Hernandez. Novak and Hernandez have both been playing well throughout the tournament and are considered strong contenders for the title.\nFerreira and Martin, meanwhile, will have to regroup and reassess their game strategies as they prepare for upcoming tournaments. While their performances at the Czech Indoor Open may have been disappointing, both players have had successful seasons so far and are still contenders for major titles in the future. Fans will be watching closely to see how both Ferreira and Martin rebound from their losses and come back stronger in their next matches.", "Cupertino, California - Apple Inc. surprised the market on Tuesday by posting better-than-expected fourth-quarter profits, but analysts remain concerned about the company's future growth prospects.\nThe company reported earnings per share of $0.76 on revenue of $64.7 billion, beating estimates of $0.70 on revenue of $63.7 billion. iPhone sales, which accounted for almost half of Apple's revenue, were down 21% year-over-year, but were still better than many had anticipated.\nDespite the positive results, some analysts remain concerned about Apple's long-term growth prospects. The company has relied heavily on iPhone sales for the majority of its revenue, and with that business showing signs of slowing down, investors have become increasingly worried about where the company will find new growth opportunities.\n\"Apple's Q4 results were better than expected, but there are still some concerns about the company's future,\" said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. \"The company is facing a number of headwinds, including a slowing smartphone market, increasing competition, and regulatory pressure.\"\nWhile Apple has been expanding into new areas like wearables, services, and home automation, these businesses are still relatively small compared to its iPhone business. Wearables and accessories, which includes products like the Apple Watch and AirPods, represented just 7.9% of the company's revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 6.5% a year ago. Services like Apple Music and iCloud made up 22.5% of revenue, up from 18.3% last year.\nDespite their relatively small contribution to revenue, analysts say these areas could be key to Apple's future growth. The company has been pushing hard on services, launching new products like Apple TV+, Arcade, and News+. The company is also expanding into new markets like India, where it hopes to gain market share by offering lower-cost versions of its products.\n\"Apple's services business is growing at a healthy rate and is becoming an increasingly important part of the company's overall revenue mix,\" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. \"The company has an opportunity to monetize its massive user base through new services and products.\"\nApple is also facing pressure from regulators and lawmakers, who have been increasingly critical of the company's business practices. The European Union recently launched two antitrust investigations into the company's App Store and Apple Pay, while lawmakers in the U.S. have accused the company of anti-competitive behavior.\n\"While Apple's regulatory concerns may not have a significant impact on the company's near-term financial results, they could limit the company's ability to grow in the future,\" said Forte.\nDespite these concerns, many analysts remain bullish on Apple's long-term prospects. The company has a massive cash hoard of $191.8 billion, which could be used for acquisitions or to invest in new businesses.\n\"While there are certainly challenges facing Apple, the company still has a lot of things going for it,\" said Ives. \"Apple has a loyal customer base, a strong brand, and a history of innovation. The company has been successful in the past by entering new markets and developing new products, and there is reason to believe it can continue to do so in the future.\"\nApple CEO Tim Cook expressed optimism about the company's future in a statement accompanying the earnings release.\n\"We are proud to report a strong finish to an unprecedented year,\" he said. \"We're optimistic about what the holiday quarter has in store, and we're looking forward to sharing our vision for the future with our customers and shareholders in the coming months.\"", "Shanghai, China \u2013 China has recently launched its first major shipping exchange in Shanghai, aiming to further develop its maritime industry and boost its goal of becoming a global shipping power.\nThe China National Shipping Exchange (CNSE) has commenced operations on June 28, after receiving approval from China's Ministry of Transport and the Shanghai municipal government. The exchange serves as a platform for shipping companies to trade shipping-related assets such as freight contracts, ship rentals, and sale and purchase agreements.\nWith over 4,000 domestic and foreign registered members, CNSE is expected to facilitate a fair and transparent market for shipping transactions, enable more efficient allocation of resources and reduce transaction costs for participants.\n\"As the world's largest shipping country, building a major shipping exchange represents a significant measure of promoting the development of shipping and logistics industries, as well as expanding the opening-up and collaboration of the financial market,\" said Liu Xiaosong, the CEO of CNSE.\nThe launch of CNSE is part of China's broader efforts to enhance its shipping industry and support its Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to connect Asia, Europe, and Africa through a network of trade routes.\nAccording to data from the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry, Chinese shipping companies have a 40% share of the global shipping market. The country also has the world's largest ports in Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan, and the number of ships owned by Chinese companies has surpassed those owned by Japanese and South Korean firms.\nHowever, the industry has also faced challenges such as overcapacity, high debt levels, and fluctuating freight rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has also severely impacted global trade, leading to a decline in demand and increased competition within the industry.\nTo address these issues, Chinese shipping companies have been exploring new business models and technologies, such as blockchain and digitalization, to improve efficiency and reduce costs.\nCNSE will also incorporate these technologies into its operations, providing advanced services such as digital bills of lading, online auctions, and risk management tools.\n\"The launch of CNSE marks a milestone in the transformation and innovation of the traditional shipping industry. The association will continue to provide better services and products for the industry and promote the high-quality development of China's shipping industry,\" said Zhu Hongjie, the Chairman of CNSE.\nThe launch of CNSE is expected to boost China's shipping industry and strengthen its position as a major player in global trade. It also provides more opportunities for international collaboration and promotes the development of a more inclusive and sustainable shipping industry.", "The Detroit-based automobile giant General Motors Corp is hoping to avoid another strike by coming to a new labor agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union. This comes after a 40-day worker strike earlier this year that cost the company around $2 billion and disrupted production at several of its factories.\nThe previous strike, the longest by autoworkers against GM since 1970, ended when the company agreed to a new contract that included wage increases, improved healthcare benefits, and a pathway to permanent employment for temporary workers.\nHowever, the UAW's ongoing corruption scandal has put both the union and the company in a difficult position as they attempt to negotiate a new contract that is fair to both parties.\nThe UAW is currently under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for corruption and embezzlement. Several of its top officials have been convicted of accepting bribes from company executives in exchange for favorable contracts.\nThis scandal has tarnished the union's reputation and made it more difficult for its negotiators to gain the trust of rank-and-file workers. Many union members feel that their leaders have sold out to the company and betrayed the interests of ordinary workers.\nNevertheless, GM and the UAW are under pressure to come to an agreement that will prevent another strike. The company is facing increasing competition from foreign automakers, especially those in Japan and South Korea, which have been able to produce high-quality cars at lower costs than their American counterparts.\nGM is also struggling to adapt to changes in the industry, such as the shift towards electric and self-driving vehicles, which require significant capital investment and technological expertise.\nIn order to avoid a second strike, GM is offering the UAW a new contract that includes wage increases, bonuses, and improved healthcare benefits. The company is also offering to create new jobs and invest in several of its factories, including one in Detroit that has been shut down for several years.\nHowever, the UAW is pushing for more concessions from the company, including better retirement benefits, more job security, and a greater say in hiring and promotions. Union leaders have also called on GM to reopen several of its factories that have been closed or downsized in recent years.\nThe negotiations between GM and the UAW are being closely watched by both the auto industry and the labor movement, as they could set a precedent for future labor negotiations in other industries.\nIf GM and the UAW are able to come to a new contract that is fair to both sides, it would be a significant achievement for the labor movement at a time when unions are facing significant challenges in the United States.\nHowever, if the negotiations break down and the UAW calls for another strike, it could have serious consequences for both the company and the union. Another strike could further damage the reputation of the UAW and make it more difficult for the union to negotiate favorable contracts with other companies in the future.\nFor GM, another strike would be a major blow to its bottom line and its efforts to remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry. It could also push more customers towards its foreign competitors, which are already taking market share from American automakers.\nOverall, the negotiations between GM and the UAW are critical for both the company and the union. They will determine the future of the American auto industry and the role of organized labor in that industry. As such, they are being closely watched by both investors and workers, who are hoping for a positive outcome that will benefit both parties.", "Caterpillar Inc., the Illinois-based global manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has announced that it is prepared to impose unilateral employment terms on UAW (United Auto Workers) workers after an impasse in negotiations.\nThe negotiation process began in September, and the two sides have been unable to reach an agreement on issues such as wages, benefits, and working conditions. The previous labor contract, which covered more than 10,000 UAW-represented employees, expired on Oct. 1.\nIn a statement, Caterpillar said that despite its best efforts, the company and the union have been unable to find common ground. \"We have been negotiating in good faith and exploring a range of options to find a mutually beneficial outcome for our employees and our customers,\" the company said. \"Unfortunately, at this point, further discussion is not productive.\"\nThe company added that it would move forward with plans to impose unilateral terms, which would be effective immediately. These terms include wage increases, changes to the healthcare plan, and modifications to the work schedule.\nThe decision to impose unilateral terms is not uncommon in labor disputes, but it is often seen as a last resort. It means that the company can dictate the terms of employment without agreement from the union, and often leads to strained relations between the two sides.\nIn response, the UAW has accused Caterpillar of engaging in an \"attack on workers' rights\". In a statement, the union said that the company's decision to impose unilateral terms is \"disappointing and unnecessary\".\n\"We have been negotiating in good faith with Caterpillar for months, trying to reach an agreement that is fair to our members and to the company,\" the statement read. \"Instead of working with us, Caterpillar has chosen to unilaterally impose its own terms, which are not in the best interests of our members or the company.\"\nThe UAW has not ruled out the possibility of striking in response to Caterpillar's decision. A strike would be a significant disruption for the company, which relies heavily on UAW-represented workers to manufacture its products.\nThe dispute between Caterpillar and the UAW comes at a time of increased tension between labor unions and large corporations. The UAW has been involved in high-profile negotiations with other companies, including General Motors and Ford, while unions in other industries, such as healthcare and education, have also been engaging in workplace actions.\nIt remains to be seen how the dispute between Caterpillar and the UAW will be resolved, but it is clear that relations between the two sides have been strained by the impasse in negotiations.", "Ivory Coast's leading agro-industrial company, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Internationale de Plantations d'H\u00e9v\u00e9as (SIFCA), announced its intention to liquidate its loss-making subsidiary, SAPH, but assured the public that it would not have any impact on port arrivals.\nAccording to a spokesperson for SIFCA, the decision to liquidate SAPH was made due to the subsidiary\u2019s inability to meet its financial obligations, including debt repayment and salaries of its workers.\n\"SAPH has been facing serious financial challenges for some time, and despite SIFCA's efforts to turn things around, we have realised that it is no longer viable to maintain the company\u2019s operations,\" the spokesperson stated.\nSIFCA has assured the public that the liquidation process would not affect port arrivals or the operations of other subsidiaries in Ivory Coast.\n\"SIFCA will continue to operate its other subsidiaries, including the palm oil producer Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Plantations d'H\u00e9v\u00e9as (SAPH), which has been performing well. The liquidation of SAPH will not have any impact on our ability to supply our products to the market,\" the spokesperson added.\nSIFCA is considered a key player in the Ivory Coast's agricultural sector, with a diversified portfolio of activities ranging from rubber plantations to the production of palm oil, sugar, and cocoa. The group owns several subsidiaries in Ivory Coast and neighboring countries, including Liberia, Guinea, and Ghana.\nSAPH, which operates rubber plantations across the country, has been struggling financially for years, with debts reportedly amounting to over XOF 50 billion (approximately $93 million). The company has also been hit by falling rubber prices, low productivity, and high operational costs.\n\"In recent years, SAPH has been struggling to remain competitive due to various factors, including the high operational costs, the scarcity of labor, and the low prices of rubber in the international market,\" said a report by the International Rubber Study Group (IRSG).\nThe report noted that Ivory Coast and other African countries were facing increasing competition from Asian producers in the global rubber market, which had led to declining prices and reduced demand for African-grown rubber.\nSIFCA, which owns a 51% stake in SAPH, has been trying to overhaul the subsidiary's operations, including reducing its workforce and cutting costs. However, these efforts have not been enough to save the loss-making company.\nThe liquidation process is expected to take several months, during which SIFCA will work to settle SAPH's outstanding debts and provide support to its employees.\n\"SIFCA is committed to supporting the affected workers by providing severance packages, retraining programs, and other forms of support to help them find new opportunities,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe announcement of SAPH's liquidation has raised concerns about the state of Ivory Coast's agricultural sector, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and falling commodity prices.\nIvory Coast, the world's leading producer of cocoa, has seen a decline in cocoa prices in recent months, with farmers struggling to make ends meet. The pandemic has also disrupted global supply chains, affecting the export of agricultural products from Ivory Coast and other African countries.\nHowever, SIFCA remains optimistic about the future of the sector, citing the potential for increased demand for sustainably produced palm oil and other agricultural commodities.\n\"SIFCA remains committed to investing in Ivory Coast's agricultural sector and creating opportunities for the country's farmers and workers. We believe that with the right policies and investments, Ivory Coast can continue to be a major player in the global agriculture market,\" the spokesperson said."]}
