Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr", "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

The Crawick Artland Trust, which manages the site, has said it hopes to attract international visitors and boost business in Sanquhar, Kelloholm and Kirkconnel. The opening performance, which coincides with the Summer solstice, is called Oceanallover and it has been specially developed by artistic director Alex Rigg. He said: \"Through conversations with Charles Jencks and with the Duke of Buccleuch and the local community, it is clear to me that my job is to present something which is interesting to look at in itself but allows other people to see the potential of the site for future events.\" The performance is likely to raise", "The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also taking place.

They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of", "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 \"age restricted ... high quality assisted living\" apartments for which it said there was \"a", "The group behind London Array wind farm said it would take three years to look at the possible effect of the extra turbines on red-throated divers. It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected.

The NCA said that it had targeted users of software called Netspoof, a computer program that could direct huge volumes of internet traffic at websites and web servers in order to disable them.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is expected to announce the amendment to existing legislation on Monday. The changes - to be announced on Monday - will take effect from 16 May. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for data protection, said the change will sent a \"clear message\" to rogue companies. \"Nuisance calls are incredibly intrusive and can cause significant harm to elderly and vulnerable members of society.\" The government was committed to tackling the problem, she said.

Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours. The BMA's junior doctors committee is due to meet to consider its response. Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days. The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be \"clarity about the next steps by the end of the day\".

The IFA's Disciplinary Committee also imposed fines of \u00a3400 on each player, whose names have not been released. Prior to Wednesday night's hearing, all five players admitted to a breach of rules but claimed they had acted independently in placing bets.

Sharp said the TVs bearing its name broke US rules on electromagnetic emissions and that Hisense had made false claims about picture quality. Hisense said it \"categorically\" denied the claims made in Sharp's court papers and it would defend itself. As well as accusing the Hisense-made TV sets of breaking emission guidelines, Sharp said the devices also broke Federal Trade Commission rules on pictures sizes and did not meet wider industry standards covering device safety. Sharp's legal papers said its brand was at risk of being \"destroyed\" by the \"shoddily manufactured\" TV sets by the time the five-year deal ended. It wants Hisense to stop using the Sharp name. The legal action is believed to be linked to Sharp's efforts to rebuild itself after a long period of turmoil.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Gerrard travelled to Rotterdam and met international drug traffickers with the plan of importing drugs from Latin America to Europe. The NCA appealed for help to find him following an October 2013 raid on a cafe in the Dutch city.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts. The Scottish government said local authorities would be compensated. The poll tax, or community charge, was abolished more than 20 years ago in 1993 after only four years in operation in Scotland. The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets.

Drone-based complaints include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours, near misses with aircraft and prison smuggling, said PA. The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded.

The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period.

It warns, with the workforce slashed by 16%, there are not enough response officers to \"rush to help\", communities are being left unsafe at night and drink-drivers are \"getting away with offences\". The federation says the force has had to slash \u00a317m from its budget and there are \"at least\" \u00a310m in cuts \"to come\". Federation chairman Mike White said: \"In reality, 80% of our policing budget is down to staff and staff", "A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: \"There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences. \"In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's new role as a resettlement prison, and in delivering treatment", "Last week, the High Court's rejected a bid by ministers to delay publication of the plan, which was prompted by high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This means the document should be published in the next week. Courts had given ministers until Monday 24 April to set out the draft guidelines. But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules. Bid to delay air pollution plan fails A special hearing was held on Thursday 27 April to discuss this application, but it was rejected by the judge, Mr Justice Garnham. Now, Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman has said the plan will be published between Thursday's local government elections and the deadline of 9 May imposed in the hearing last week.

It's proven particularly popular with DJs, inspiring tweets, mash-ups, videos and confusion. But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'.

At Selkirk Sheriff Court the 48-year-old was found guilty of committing the offences at the Ship Inn in Melrose. He was human resources manager at the pub where his wife was licensee. The court was told he repeatedly indecently assaulted one female employee between 2001 and 2011 by touching her breasts and buttocks which meant she tried to avoid contact with him. In 2007, McDonald indecently assaulted another female by touching her in a sexual nature. She immediately left her job. He was also found guilty of uttering sexual remarks to staff members over a 10-year period and on one occasion exposed himself in front of members of the public and two female members of staff. On July 14 last year McDonald sexually assaulted an 18-year-old female customer in the pub by touching her breasts and putting his hand", "Ryanair has cancelled more than 250 flights across Europe so far, including at least 26 flights in and out of Dublin and Shannon airports.

A lack of safe routes was cited by 38% as a barrier to cycling. Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill said his department's investment in cycling \"will help keep young cyclists safe\". The survey suggested that 44% of people in this age group never cycled and were therefore \"missing out on the benefits of cycling entirely\". However, Brake also found more people surveyed disagreed (59%) than agreed (41%) with the idea that current speed limits in their area are too fast for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. Brake's deputy chief executive, Julie Townsend, said: \"That so many teenagers are being held back from walking and cycling by safety fears, in spite of its great benefits, is a", "More than 42,000 advance tickets have already been sold for the retrospective which opens to the public on Saturday.

It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash on 22 August. The AAIB said it was not clear whether Mr Hill initiated his ejection. The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited. The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit. The report states: \"The investigation continues to determine if the pilot attempted to initiate ejection or if the canopy and pilot's seat were liberated as a result of impact damage to the cockpit.\" The AAIB's report also revealed there was no \"blackbox\" flight recorder on the vintage jet, however, there were two cameras", "His wife greeted him at their home in Toronto, Canada, and he was seen on the estate grounds by 14:00 (16:00 GMT).

Earlier, Canada said he would be allowed to live there upon his release. Black was born in Canada but renounced his citizenship in 2001 to accept a peerage in Britain's House of Lords. He is a British citizen. The move to grant Black a one-year temporary residence permit stirred debate in Canada's House of Commons.

A limited company since April this year, it has set up a micro-brewery in Kirkhill Industrial Estate. Owners Dave Grant and David McHardy used redundancy pay-offs from their other jobs to help fund the business. Investors have also come on board to help finance the brewery, which is the only registered brewery in Aberdeen. Before the official launch this week, the brewery had been in operation for two months and in that time produced more than 20,000 litres of beer. With business development manager Louise Grant, the owners are producing eight beers which they are selling across the UK. Mr McHardy said: \"We have both been passionate about brewing ever since we purchased our first home brewing kits a few years ago. \"When I met Dave on a brewing course in England, it was clear to me", "Eleanor Payne and Samantha Lake, 19, and Daniel Greenwood, 22 died when their tour bus skidded and overturned near Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. They were among a group of students and teachers from Brooksby Melton College in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. After the hearing their families said the condition of the bus as an \"accident waiting to happen\". Previously, tour guide Trevor Dearlove denied failing to tell the passengers to wear seat belts and the bus driver was cleared of culpable murder. The three-day inquest at Loughborough Coroner's Court heard the group, who were studying for a degree in animal management and welfare, were on their way from Swaziland to visit a chimpanzee sanctuary.

The group of Central Asian nationals was suspected of killing 17 motorists in the Moscow area between 2012 and 2014. Cars were forced to stop on a main road and their drivers were killed for reasons as yet unknown; none of their possessions were stolen.

The figures also reveal that SSE has almost all of its customers on the most expensive form of tariff. 91% of SSE customers are on standard variable tariffs, compared to just 9% at First Utility. The number of people stuck on standard tariffs is controversial, as most fixed-rate deals are cheaper. In the UK as a whole, 66% of households are on standard tariffs.

Shena Winning said a picture of the trust's acting chief executive with Mr Reckless suggested the NHS backed UKIP. Mr Reckless said the photo showed his support for the hospital. Ms Winning's letter to former Conservative MP Mr Reckless said board directors were \"extremely concerned and surprised\" to see the picture of him with Dr Phillip Barnes. Ms Winning said the photograph had been taken in September when Mr Reckless was the sitting MP for Rochester. Mr Reckless defected to UKIP on 27 September, triggering a by-election in which 13 candidates are standing.

During training, men appeared to show a preference for heavier-looking women. Lead researcher Dr Carlota Batres said men's preferences may adapt in tough environments so they mate with women best equipped to survive and reproduce. \"Our findings provide new evidence for the malleability of preferences depending on the environment,\" she said. \"We found that the weight preferences in prospective female partners changed in response to the harsher environment and then remained at the new level while the environment remained harsh. \"Such changes in preferences may be beneficial because they allow for increased opportunities to form partnerships with those who are better equipped to survive illness or uncertain food availability.\" Participants were asked to rate computer-generated female faces, which varied in apparent weight.

Police in the western city of Bochum said the suspect had also boasted in a chat-room about murdering a woman. Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details. As the search for Marcel Hesse spread across the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, a school was placed under lockdown for several hours some 30km (18 miles) away.

The case will go back to the organisation's appeal board on 24 May, when Best's conviction is likely to be overturned. However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias.

About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November.
