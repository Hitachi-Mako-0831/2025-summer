Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr", "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region.

Speaking at an event in Berlin, he urged Germany to use its G20 presidency in 2017 to make progress. Mr Carney has previously warned of climate change risks for the finance industry. At the event on Thursday, Mr Carney said that in theory capital should flow from advanced to emerging economies due to high returns. In practice, however, the opposite has happened - and this has driven down bond yields in advanced economies, he said. When money has sporadically flowed to emerging economies it has had a destabilising influence, he said. \"In this context, green finance is a major opportunity. By ensuring that capital flows finance long-term projects in countries where growth is most carbon intensive, financial stability can be promoted,\" he said.

It is hoped the scheme could result in fewer visits to GPs -potentially saving the NHS millions of pounds a year. But pharmacies say cuts in funding to the sector could jeopardise the scheme. The Sore Throat Test and Treat service, which has been trialled in 35 Boots pharmacies, will determine if an illness is caused by a virus - meaning drugs will not help - or a bacterial infection. Results from a throat swab, which measures sugars on the tongue, are provided in five minutes. Patients who can be helped by antibiotics will be prescribed them by the pharmacist and not have to see a GP.

The Crawick Artland Trust, which manages the site, has said it hopes to attract international visitors and boost business in Sanquhar, Kelloholm and Kirkconnel. The opening performance, which coincides with the Summer solstice, is called Oceanallover and it has been specially developed by artistic director Alex Rigg. He said: \"Through conversations with Charles Jencks and with the Duke of Buccleuch and the local community, it is clear to me that my job is to present something which is interesting to look at in itself but allows other people to see the potential of the site for future events.\" The performance is likely to raise", "The European Challenge Tour event will be part of a big week in the season with both the US PGA Championship and Women's British Open also taking place.

They escaped back through the same hole. Police later found a burned-out vehicle close to the airport. Police are looking for eight men, a prosecutors' spokeswoman said. Caroline De Wolf, of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, estimated the haul at $50m, saying: \"What we are talking about is obviously a gigantic sum.\" Earlier reports suggested the figure was even higher - with the Belgian state broadcaster reportedly putting it at 350m euros ($468m). AFP quoted an unnamed spokeswoman at the same Antwerp centre calling the robbery \"one of the biggest\" ever. She said that the diamonds were \"rough stones\" being transported from Antwerp to Zurich. Antwerp is the hub of the world diamond trade - about 150m euros' worth of", "The Lyndhurst Park Hotel, once linked to smuggling, was visited by Treasure Island author Robert Louis Stevenson. Developer PegasusLife wants to replace it with 74 pensioner flats. Opponents insist the unlisted building is historically significant and an influx of elderly residents would put pressure on services in the village. The plans to be considered by the National Park Authority (NPA) are open for consultation until early January. Originally named, Glasshayes House, the mansion house on the edge of Lyndhurst was built in the early 19th Century as a private home for railway entrepreneur Charles Castleman. Along with Louis Stevenson, its notable historical guests included Lord Carnarvon of Highclere Castle. It later became the Grand Hotel, and then the Lyndhurst Park Hotel. PegasusLife plans to replace it with 74 \"age restricted ... high quality assisted living\" apartments for which it said there was \"a", "The group behind London Array wind farm said it would take three years to look at the possible effect of the extra turbines on red-throated divers. It had hoped to increase the number of turbines between Kent and Essex to 341. The area is the winter home of about 6,500 red-throated divers - at least one third of the UK's population. London Array said it had formally requested The Crown Estate to terminate the agreement for lease for the phase two area and had cancelled the grid capacity that was reserved at the National Grid substation in Graveney, Kent. The wind farm, 10 miles north of Ramsgate, Kent, was given the green light in 2006 on condition that phase two, to add an extra 166 turbines, would only go ahead if the red-throated divers were protected.

The NCA said that it had targeted users of software called Netspoof, a computer program that could direct huge volumes of internet traffic at websites and web servers in order to disable them.

The Department for Communities and Local Government is expected to announce the amendment to existing legislation on Monday. The changes - to be announced on Monday - will take effect from 16 May. Baroness Neville-Rolfe, minister for data protection, said the change will sent a \"clear message\" to rogue companies. \"Nuisance calls are incredibly intrusive and can cause significant harm to elderly and vulnerable members of society.\" The government was committed to tackling the problem, she said.

Ministers said on Thursday they would re-start talks if they focus on Saturday pay and unsocial hours. The BMA's junior doctors committee is due to meet to consider its response. Last Monday, the government said it was willing to pause the introduction of the junior doctors' contract in England for five days to allow for talks. The BMA also agreed to defer any new threats of strikes for five days. The BBC's health editor Hugh Pym quoted a source as saying the government's preconditions were seen as a complicating factor but that there would be \"clarity about the next steps by the end of the day\".

The IFA's Disciplinary Committee also imposed fines of \u00a3400 on each player, whose names have not been released. Prior to Wednesday night's hearing, all five players admitted to a breach of rules but claimed they had acted independently in placing bets.

Sharp said the TVs bearing its name broke US rules on electromagnetic emissions and that Hisense had made false claims about picture quality. Hisense said it \"categorically\" denied the claims made in Sharp's court papers and it would defend itself. As well as accusing the Hisense-made TV sets of breaking emission guidelines, Sharp said the devices also broke Federal Trade Commission rules on pictures sizes and did not meet wider industry standards covering device safety. Sharp's legal papers said its brand was at risk of being \"destroyed\" by the \"shoddily manufactured\" TV sets by the time the five-year deal ended. It wants Hisense to stop using the Sharp name. The legal action is believed to be linked to Sharp's efforts to rebuild itself after a long period of turmoil.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Gerrard travelled to Rotterdam and met international drug traffickers with the plan of importing drugs from Latin America to Europe. The NCA appealed for help to find him following an October 2013 raid on a cafe in the Dutch city.

The independence referendum led to an increase in numbers of people registering to vote. Expanded electoral rolls were used to identify those who had debts. The Scottish government said local authorities would be compensated. The poll tax, or community charge, was abolished more than 20 years ago in 1993 after only four years in operation in Scotland. The unpopular poll tax, which replaced the rates system, was introduced by the Conservative Thatcher government in Scotland in 1989 before the rest of the country, sparking protests on the streets.

Drone-based complaints include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours, near misses with aircraft and prison smuggling, said PA. The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded.

The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period.

It warns, with the workforce slashed by 16%, there are not enough response officers to \"rush to help\", communities are being left unsafe at night and drink-drivers are \"getting away with offences\". The federation says the force has had to slash \u00a317m from its budget and there are \"at least\" \u00a310m in cuts \"to come\". Federation chairman Mike White said: \"In reality, 80% of our policing budget is down to staff and staff", "A report into HMP Moorland said almost half of all prisoners claimed it was easy to get drugs compared to 28% at the last inspection. Inspectors said the availability of new psychoactive substances (NPS) was undermining recent progress. Prison bosses said more work needed to be done to tackle the problem. The report follows an unannounced inspection of the prison, near Hatfield Woodhouse, in February. It found the number of violent incidents, fights and assaults had increased since the last inspection in 2012 and levels were also higher than at similar prisons. More on this and other local stories in South Yorkshire Peter Clarke, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: \"There are real opportunities at Moorland to make progress, but the issues of NPS... have such a negative impact on prisoners' experiences. \"In particular, there is a real opportunity to make progress in embracing the prison's new role as a resettlement prison, and in delivering treatment", "Last week, the High Court's rejected a bid by ministers to delay publication of the plan, which was prompted by high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). This means the document should be published in the next week. Courts had given ministers until Monday 24 April to set out the draft guidelines. But on the Friday before the deadline, the government lodged an application to delay release until after the general election on 8 June. They argued that publication would fall foul of election \"purdah\" rules. Bid to delay air pollution plan fails A special hearing was held on Thursday 27 April to discuss this application, but it was rejected by the judge, Mr Justice Garnham. Now, Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman has said the plan will be published between Thursday's local government elections and the deadline of 9 May imposed in the hearing last week.

It's proven particularly popular with DJs, inspiring tweets, mash-ups, videos and confusion. But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'.

At Selkirk Sheriff Court the 48-year-old was found guilty of committing the offences at the Ship Inn in Melrose. He was human resources manager at the pub where his wife was licensee. The court was told he repeatedly indecently assaulted one female employee between 2001 and 2011 by touching her breasts and buttocks which meant she tried to avoid contact with him. In 2007, McDonald indecently assaulted another female by touching her in a sexual nature. She immediately left her job. He was also found guilty of uttering sexual remarks to staff members over a 10-year period and on one occasion exposed himself in front of members of the public and two female members of staff. On July 14 last year McDonald sexually assaulted an 18-year-old female customer in the pub by touching her breasts and putting his hand", "Ryanair has cancelled more than 250 flights across Europe so far, including at least 26 flights in and out of Dublin and Shannon airports.

A lack of safe routes was cited by 38% as a barrier to cycling. Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill said his department's investment in cycling \"will help keep young cyclists safe\". The survey suggested that 44% of people in this age group never cycled and were therefore \"missing out on the benefits of cycling entirely\". However, Brake also found more people surveyed disagreed (59%) than agreed (41%) with the idea that current speed limits in their area are too fast for the safety of cyclists and pedestrians. Brake's deputy chief executive, Julie Townsend, said: \"That so many teenagers are being held back from walking and cycling by safety fears, in spite of its great benefits, is a", "More than 42,000 advance tickets have already been sold for the retrospective which opens to the public on Saturday.

It also said pilot Andy Hill was thrown clear of the aircraft during the later part of the crash on 22 August. The AAIB said it was not clear whether Mr Hill initiated his ejection. The 51-year-old pilot is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital. The report says the Hawker Hunter's canopy was released at the initial impact. At this time fuel and fuel vapour was released and then ignited. The jet split into four parts and both Mr Hill and his seat were thrown clear of the cockpit. The report states: \"The investigation continues to determine if the pilot attempted to initiate ejection or if the canopy and pilot's seat were liberated as a result of impact damage to the cockpit.\" The AAIB's report also revealed there was no \"blackbox\" flight recorder on the vintage jet, however, there were two cameras", "His wife greeted him at their home in Toronto, Canada, and he was seen on the estate grounds by 14:00 (16:00 GMT).

Earlier, Canada said he would be allowed to live there upon his release. Black was born in Canada but renounced his citizenship in 2001 to accept a peerage in Britain's House of Lords. He is a British citizen. The move to grant Black a one-year temporary residence permit stirred debate in Canada's House of Commons.

A limited company since April this year, it has set up a micro-brewery in Kirkhill Industrial Estate. Owners Dave Grant and David McHardy used redundancy pay-offs from their other jobs to help fund the business. Investors have also come on board to help finance the brewery, which is the only registered brewery in Aberdeen. Before the official launch this week, the brewery had been in operation for two months and in that time produced more than 20,000 litres of beer. With business development manager Louise Grant, the owners are producing eight beers which they are selling across the UK. Mr McHardy said: \"We have both been passionate about brewing ever since we purchased our first home brewing kits a few years ago. \"When I met Dave on a brewing course in England, it was clear to me", "Eleanor Payne and Samantha Lake, 19, and Daniel Greenwood, 22 died when their tour bus skidded and overturned near Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. They were among a group of students and teachers from Brooksby Melton College in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. After the hearing their families said the condition of the bus as an \"accident waiting to happen\". Previously, tour guide Trevor Dearlove denied failing to tell the passengers to wear seat belts and the bus driver was cleared of culpable murder. The three-day inquest at Loughborough Coroner's Court heard the group, who were studying for a degree in animal management and welfare, were on their way from Swaziland to visit a chimpanzee sanctuary.

The group of Central Asian nationals was suspected of killing 17 motorists in the Moscow area between 2012 and 2014. Cars were forced to stop on a main road and their drivers were killed for reasons as yet unknown; none of their possessions were stolen.

The figures also reveal that SSE has almost all of its customers on the most expensive form of tariff. 91% of SSE customers are on standard variable tariffs, compared to just 9% at First Utility. The number of people stuck on standard tariffs is controversial, as most fixed-rate deals are cheaper. In the UK as a whole, 66% of households are on standard tariffs.

Shena Winning said a picture of the trust's acting chief executive with Mr Reckless suggested the NHS backed UKIP. Mr Reckless said the photo showed his support for the hospital. Ms Winning's letter to former Conservative MP Mr Reckless said board directors were \"extremely concerned and surprised\" to see the picture of him with Dr Phillip Barnes. Ms Winning said the photograph had been taken in September when Mr Reckless was the sitting MP for Rochester. Mr Reckless defected to UKIP on 27 September, triggering a by-election in which 13 candidates are standing.

During training, men appeared to show a preference for heavier-looking women. Lead researcher Dr Carlota Batres said men's preferences may adapt in tough environments so they mate with women best equipped to survive and reproduce. \"Our findings provide new evidence for the malleability of preferences depending on the environment,\" she said. \"We found that the weight preferences in prospective female partners changed in response to the harsher environment and then remained at the new level while the environment remained harsh. \"Such changes in preferences may be beneficial because they allow for increased opportunities to form partnerships with those who are better equipped to survive illness or uncertain food availability.\" Participants were asked to rate computer-generated female faces, which varied in apparent weight.

Police in the western city of Bochum said the suspect had also boasted in a chat-room about murdering a woman. Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details. As the search for Marcel Hesse spread across the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, a school was placed under lockdown for several hours some 30km (18 miles) away.

The case will go back to the organisation's appeal board on 24 May, when Best's conviction is likely to be overturned. However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias.

About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November.

The change will come into force across the EU from Friday. As a result, the inquiries in the UK into whether the policy was anti-competitive are expected to be closed. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the UK and the Federal Cartel Office in Germany have been investigating Amazon over the policy, following numerous complaints. The OFT was looking into whether Amazon's policy could affect the prices that traders charged, including on their own websites. It was also concerned that it could restrict the entry of other traders into the market. Now, as a result of Amazon's change of policy, it said it was minded to close the investigation, while the German authorities said they wanted to check the policy was definitely withdrawn. \"We welcome Amazon's decision to end its Marketplace price parity policy across the European Union,\" said Cavendish Elithorn of the", "Six US Marines and two Nepali soldiers were on board the helicopter as it delivered aid to earthquake victims.

A Nepali battalion are searching on the ground, while US aircrafts work in shifts to search for the missing crew. The air search had been halted overnight due to darkness, but resumed in the morning with the Americans deploying two Huey helicopters and two MV-22 tilt-rotor Osprey aircrafts. The missing US team had been working in the vicinity of Charikot, a village that has been hit hard, a spokesman for the US Pacific Command said.

He added: \"But above all, investment in job opportunities.\" He said he would not \"punish the people of Wales by underfunding the Welsh Government\", adding there would be \"recognition of the levels of poverty that exist in many of the valley towns\".

Health will be a central part of the Chancellor George Osborne 's spending review next week - he will set out how the \u00a38bn commitment will be phased in. But since the pledge was made before the election, he and other ministers have been careful to say this extra funding over and above inflation is for the NHS. It is expected that the Chancellor will confirm that this investment will be granted to NHS England.

James Fuller (48) and Tom Smith (47 not out) put on 57 before Curran broke the stand by bowling the former, and Surrey reached 74-2 in reply at close of play. Surrey went into the game needing a maximum of 43 points from four matches to be sure of a return to Division One next summer. And they reduced the home side to 63-4 after Curran's younger brother Sam (2-47) had Will Tavare lbw in the second over.

It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving confidence in understanding politics. Those aged 16 and 17 were able to vote in the referendum on 18 September, the first UK ballot to include them. Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later. More than 1,000 young people responded to each survey. They found under 18s were at least as interested in politics as adults. Only 7% had never talked about the referendum with anyone. Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%. Parents had a strong influence in encouraging young people to vote, but had less impact on how", "Trish Knight has told the BBC her whole family was still struggling to come to terms with the death of James, 26, following a drunken row at his home in Leicester in March.

The Daily Record newspaper quoted eyewitnesses as saying Mr Roberts had been subjected to a horrific beating for about half an hour before his attacker dragged him into the street and left him lying in a puddle.

Mr Smith said he would have Mr Jones sit in a shadow cabinet with metropolitan English leaders and the Scottish Labour leader. Meanwhile he blamed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for the party's fall in support at the assembly election. Labour fell short of a majority at the May election, losing one seat. Mr Corbyn launched his campaign to hold on to the Labour leadership on Thursday, urging MPs to get behind the party. Mr Smith said the perception that he thought there should be no further powers devolved to Cardiff Bay was an impression Plaid Cymru was \"keen to build up as they were trying to drive a wedge between me and Carwyn Jones\".

The motorist from Liverpool had committed speeding offences and failed to declare the name of the driver of the vehicle, the IAM said. A man from Warrington has the second highest number of points at 36 for driving without insurance. Other drivers who avoided bans include: All points were accrued from 2011 to December 2013.

In 2015, the court fined whaling company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha 1m Australian dollars ($760m; \u00c2\u00a3580m) for catching minke whales within the waters of Australia's Antarctic whale sanctuary.

The Liberal Democrat councillors who threw out the plan had faced criticism after it emerged their party accepted tens of thousands of pounds in donations from the club. The councillors had not declared the donations at the meeting. Both Labour councillors and the developer Oakmayne were unaware of the size and scale of the donations until they were revealed by the BBC. It also emerged that the council's in-house lawyer had warned councillors they may be in breach of the law by not declaring the gifts.

Chief Constable George Hamilton and other members of the senior PSNI members will meet members of the Policing Board to discuss an implementation plan to address concerns raised. A number of changes to the 22-week training course were introduced immediately.

Ms Plass, who walks the cliffs regularly, said the section next to the coast path was slowly falling away. \"Every time I go there it seems the fissure has grown and the cliff has moved closer to falling to the beach,\" she said. \"It could go at any time because the hot weather will expand air pockets in the cliff and send it off.\" She spoke to one of the men taking pictures, but he said they were \"fine\", she said. \"It is not fine.

Bamber challenged a refusal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal as a miscarriage of justice. The CCRC, an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages, rejected Bamber's last appeal in April. The decision on Thursday follows a single judge rejecting Bamber's application for permission to seek judicial review of the CCRC's decision after he studied the case papers in private. Bamber made a renewed application dealt with by Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Globe. Announcing the decision, Sir John said that having looked at the approach taken by the CCRC in the case he could not see \"any way\" in which a challenge could be made to the decision reached. \"It seems to me that a challenge is impossible to mount,\" he said.

Little Mix said they had no idea there was a charity with the same name when they came up with Rhythmix. \"We're happy that this has now been resolved,\" they added. \"We're the same girls as we've always been and we want to thank all of our fans for their continued support. \"We came up with some ideas for our new name which we discussed with Tulisa and she", "The supermarket's like-for-like sales, which strip out new stores, fell by 0.5% in the period to 11 March. However, Argos sales rose 4.3%, resulting in a 0.3% increase excluding fuel across the Sainsbury's group. Sainsbury's said the market remained \"very competitive\" and the impact of cost pressures \"remains uncertain\". The supermarket's performance was worse than the 0.1% rise in like-for-like sales seen in the 15 weeks to 7 January. Sainsbury's convenience stores saw total sales growth of almost 7%, with 10 new outlets opening in the quarter. Chief executive Mike Coupe said customers had welcomed Sainsbury's \"differentiated food offer\", with new products including butternut squash waffles and sweet potato tagliatelle. General merchandise sales were down 4%, which Sainsbury's said was due to Easter and Mother's Day falling later this year.

It is the second Local Nature Reserve created in the Falkirk Council area. The local authority now plans to use the reserve status to attract funding to the area. The new status marks the end of an era for the site, which until the closure of its central colliery in 1983, spent almost 200 years being used for heavy industry. Parts of the area already had been recognised for their environmental importance. The mudflats and \"island\" off the foreshore are designated as a Special Protection Area for their conservation value. Councillor Adrian Mahoney, convener of leisure, tourism and community welcomed the new status for the Kinneil foreshore.

Buyer Silverstone Auctions contracted Jensen specialists Cropredy Bridge to restore the car's engine, brakes and bodywork. Morecambe, who died in 1984, was the car's sole owner. It left Jensen's factory in West Bromwich on 23 September 1968.

It includes comments from Morecambe's chauffeur Mike Fountain, who sometimes drove the comedian and his wife Joan around in the Jensen. However, as the car was marketed as a two-seater, there was little room for a third person. Mr Fountain said Morecambe often ended up \"screwed up in the back\". The Jensen was, he said, Lancashire-born Morecambe's favourite car, however not everything about it pleased him.

McAllister, 19, initially attacked the father with a bag of potatoes outside the family home. Four days later he slashed the youngest victim across the forehead with a knife. He also assaulted police during his arrest. 'Extremely serious' Describing McAllister's offending as \"extremely serious,\" the judge handed him a five-year sentence - half of which will be served in custody, with the remainder on supervised licence upon his release. Prior to sentencing, Belfast Crown Court heard the first incident occurred in the early hours of 6 June last year, when McAllister approached a house on Antrim Road in north Belfast. When the father answered the door, McAllister asked about the whereabouts of another family member, before punching the man in the face and hitting him with a bag of potatoes.

It is believed that Whitley's widow could not afford a marked grave. Chelsea's official historian Rick Glanvill said to have a headstone for Whitley would \"mean a huge amount\". \"I'd been exploring connections between the club and the cemetery, as it's unique to have one next to a football ground. \"The club's first owner and first director are buried there but what was missing was a player, so the significance of finding Whitley was huge.\" Mr Glanvill said he found out about Whitley when a neighbour - a keen Manchester United fan - bought him Albert Sewell's book Chelsea Champions! at a flea", "Unarmed Anthony Grainger, 36, was killed when he was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police operation in Cheshire in 2012.

Archaeologist Nicholas Reeves believes Tutankhamun's remains may have been rushed into an outer chamber of what was originally Queen Nefertiti's tomb. The remains of Tutankhamun, who may have been her son, were found in 1922. He died 3,000 years ago aged 19. \"Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted,\" Mr Reeves said at a press conference with the Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati on Saturday, AFP reports. \"The radar, behind the north wall [of Tutankhamun's burial chamber] seems pretty clear.

The Winnington Turn Bridge, which is part of the A533 between Northwich and the M56, is a Grade II listed structure and was one of the earliest swing bridges in Britain to have electric power.

Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media.

He was detained after security agents found blood on his hands and clothes, court documents said. Mr Manzanares' court-appointed public defender has not commented. The victim has been identified by US media as Kristy Manzanares, from Utah. A witness who entered the couple's cabin before the security agents said he saw the 39-year-old suspect dragging the victim's body to the balcony, the documents said. The witness then grabbed the woman's ankles and pulled her back in. When he asked Mr Manzanares what had happened, the man allegedly said: \"She would not stop laughing at me.\" Later, during a search by FBI agents, the suspect said, according to the documents: \"My life is over.\" The incident happened on Tuesday", "Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy is expected to win the most seats, while losses are predicted for the ruling military-backed party.

The man can be seen picking up the food waste bin, checking it, then dumping the contents into the bin next to it. Waste company Serco has apologised for the \"completely unacceptable\" behaviour of one of its agency workers. Mr Gwyer was shocked and disappointed that his efforts to recycle at his home on Colombia Avenue appeared to be in vain. He told the BBC: \"It puts people off making the effort. You just think: what's the point? Life would be easier if we just put everything in one bin!\" However, he was adamant he held Serco responsible, not the worker. He said: \"I don't really want to single out any of the lads. It's a horrible job.\" But he added: \"They just seem to be rushing everywhere and", "In the UK the products affected include funsize Mars and Milky Way bars and boxes of Celebrations. In the Netherlands Mars and Snickers bars were also affected. It comes after a customer in Germany found bits of plastic in a Snickers bar in January. The plastic was traced back to the Mars factory in the southern town of Veghel in the Netherlands. A Mars Netherlands spokesperson said: \"We cannot be sure that this plastic was only in that particular Snickers. We do not want any products on the market that may not meet our quality requirements, so we decided to take them all back.\" The recall only involved products manufactured at the Dutch plant. It covers mostly countries in Europe and does not extend to the US, where Mars is based. The company has not said how many bars are affected or how much the recall will cost.

He claimed he was taunted and spat at by staff from a competitor company. One of Donnelly's workers, James Moore, was also convicted of common assault. The victim, Kevin Boyle, claimed his nose was broken in the incident on 11 May last year. Donnelly, of St James' Park in the city, claimed he had been on the streets to try to stop aggravation between the rivals. He told Belfast Magistrates' Court that his firm had signed up to a code of conduct following meetings with City Centre Management and the Department of the Environment.

But it said he did not see settlements as an \"impediment to peace\" - a departure from previous US positions. The fate of settlements in the occupied West Bank is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel's pro-settlement government, which had sharp differences with the Obama administration on the issue, felt emboldened when Donald Trump took office last month. Since then, it has authorised 6,000 new settlement homes, in one of the biggest surges for years. On Wednesday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was moving ahead with plans to set up a new settlement in the West Bank for the first time in more than two decades.

He is the second postman from Royal Mail's Peebles office to be recognised for his heroics. His colleague, Lawrence Fairbairn, was invited to the Queen's garden party after saving a woman who was trapped in her bath for three days. Mr Waters, 61, discovered the woman while he was delivering mail in a rural part of the Scottish Borders at 12:00 on 4 June. She had been trapped under her car since 10:00, when it had apparently suffered a problem with its handbrake and rolled backwards on top of her. The postman, who has 18 years experience, released the woman before raising the alarm, waiting with her until the ambulance arrived.

Ms Huws said she hoped her report was the \"beginning of the end\" for patients being unable to have healthcare \"appropriate to their needs\". Welcoming the report, ministers said they would respond within six months. The inquiry, based on the experiences of more than a thousand Welsh speakers, found that 90% of them agreed that they should have the right to use the language when dealing with NHS wherever they live in Wales. Other findings included that: Welsh speakers who gave evidence to the inquiry reported feeling awkward and struggling to explain their feelings to an English speaking doctor.

The council said there had been issues with Entrust but it was improving. Entrust delivers much of the training and consultancy work in schools across the county. The staff transferred to the firm in 2013 included classroom support staff, school cooks, cleaners and caretakers. Ofsted carried out the inspections at 18 schools to see how effective Entrust was in supporting and raising classroom standards. It found six schools required improvement and three, which had previously been rated as good, needed to be placed in special measures. The remainder were rated as good. Ofsted regional director Lorna Fitzjohn said: \"There is considerable uncertainty among head teachers about how the local authority and Entrust work to improve", "The England midfielder, 24, made his debut from the bench in Saturday's 1-0 home win against West Bromwich Albion.

It is believed that the men were involved in repeated attempts to infiltrate the Microsoft network between January and March this year. Both were charged under the UK's Computer Misuse Act that criminalises unauthorised access to computers. Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data. Detectives from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu) carried out the raids which, said Det Sgt Rob Bryant, also led it to seize devices believed to have been used in the attacks. He added that Serocu had worked with Europol, the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, the FBI and Microsoft to investigate the intrusions. \"After speaking with Microsoft, we can confirm they did not gain access to customer information,\" he said. \"It is too early to speculate", "The firm said net profit came to 45.6m Australian dollars ($32.4m; \u00c2\u00a322.7m), an increase of 56.7% on the same period a year earlier.

Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the", "It joins Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and South Lanarkshire to make the voluntary move.

It plans to build new accommodation and education blocks at Cookham Wood, taking its capacity from 131 to 208.

It would mean current restrictions on industrial action in the NHS, the fire service, schools and other devolved services in Wales would change. UK ministers say industrial relations are a matter for Westminster. A key element of the UK government's law is to only allow strikes backed by 40% of a union's members in a ballot. But members of the Welsh Assembly's Equality, Local Government and Communities Committee agreed the new legislation was needed to maintain Wales' \"social-partnership\" approach. In March, Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said it would be a \"democratic outrage\" if ministers in London tried to block the Welsh Trade Union Bill.

The species is rare in Britain, but \"quite well-known\" elsewhere in the northern hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Canada, said Prof Horne. He was alerted to the possibility that the creatures were living in Loch Leven during a visit to the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne. Prof Horne had gone there to study a large archive of ostracods collected by a 19th Century naturalist, George Brady.

Despite the ban, more than 90% of girls and women aged between 15 and 59 in the country have undergone the procedure in recent years, according to UN estimates. Fadl was convicted in January 2015 on charges relating to the 2013 death of Suhair al-Bataa, who was from a small farming community on the outskirts of the Nile Delta city of Mansoura.

The skeleton is too small and fragile, and the rocks around it too hard, to allow it to be studied by conventional means. In addition, the rock matrix in which the fossil is preserved contains trapped minerals which prevented it from being scanned in a standard CT scanner.

More than a third of the 184 people falling into the \"young\" age bracket said they did not donate because they had a fear of needles, while about a fifth said it was because they did not know where", "Clifford, 73, was accused of indecently assaulting the girl between October 1981 and May 1982 at his Mayfair offices in London. He always denied the allegation. Clifford, of Hersham, Surrey, is serving an eight-year jail sentence after being convicted in May 2014 of a string of indecent assaults. Some of the biggest names in show business, including pop mogul Simon Cowell, late reality TV star Jade Goody and boxer Muhammad Ali, were represented by Clifford during his career. The jury took five hours and 50 minutes to find him not guilty. Wearing a blue suit and open-neck white shirt, Clifford smiled briefly and winked in the direction of his daughter in the public gallery, upon hearing the decision. He also raised his hand in a gesture of thanks to his counsel, before being led back into custody to continue his prison sentence. During the trial prosecutors accused Clifford of trying to use his \"position of power\" to \"humiliate\" the alleged victim and force her", "The alleged victim, now aged 55, told the Mirror newspaper he was abused in the 1960s and 1970s by the late MP who was a friend of his foster parents. South Wales Police admitted the claims were first made in 2013 and they failed at first to contact the complainant. The force has referred the matter to the police watchdog, the IPCC. The alleged victim, who now lives in Australia, told the newspaper he was raped by Thomas, who later became Viscount Tonypandy, at his home and another address in Cardiff. \"He spent a lot of time at my house as my parents were good friends with him. Things started small but then got a lot worse. It has been with me all my life,\" he said. He claims he reported the abuse to South Wales Police on two occasions but was \"disappointed\" with the response from officers.", "They have \"received no allegations\", but are assessing applying for an investigation-extension. The Conservatives blamed an \"administrative error\" for not declaring \u00c2\u00a338,000 of general election expenses for their Battlebus 2015 tour. It follows a Channel 4 investigation into spending in a number of constituencies, including Carlisle. The extension must be secured before a year elapses following the filing of the election expenses. Carlisle MP John Stevenson said bus costs were not included in his expenses because activists on it had been campaigning in a national, not local, capacity. \"My election agent made a return of my election expenses as required by law,\" he said. \"The party's national bus tour was authorised and paid for by Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ), was intended to promote the party's success in the general election and did not form part of my local election expenses.\" A number of police forces are investigating whether some MPs' agents should have filed", "General Athanase Kararuza and his wife died instantly, while their daughter was injured.

A string of high-ranking army officials have been targeted during the conflict. Security forces have also been accused of killing opponents and dumping them in mass graves by rights group Amnesty International. Shortly after the attack in Bujumbura, the International Criminal court announced that it was starting a preliminary investigation into the violence in Burundi.

It said there had been a \"lack of proper engagement\" over the consultation and was considering launching a judicial review. The BBC has contacted the Airports Commission and is awaiting a response. The commission gave people three weeks to submit further evidence about air pollution on 8 May, but campaigners argue this was shorter than the consultation time usually recommended by the government. The Teddington Action Group also claims the period was insufficient for people to read the report's 200 pages of technical data. Spokesman Paul McGuinness said: \"The lack of proper engagement by the Commission in relation to the latest air quality consultation is unacceptable and local people should be consulted in a meaningful way on an issue that directly impacts their health and wellbeing.\" The group also alleges there could be", "Birmingham's population is expected to rise by 150,000 by 2031 and the city council is planning to create homes and hundreds of acres of employment land.

They were each jailed. Both have applied for leave to appeal. Matthews suffocated the teenager at her home in the St George area of Bristol on 19 February while trying to kidnap her. Hoare, 21, who was pregnant at the time, was at the address. Hoare's paperwork has been received by the Court of Appeal, while Bristol Crown Court said it had received Matthews' application to appeal on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the court said this had now been passed on to the Court of Appeal. Becky's body was dismembered and hidden in a shed while a huge manhunt in Bristol attempted to track down the 16-year-old.

TV presenter and adventurer Ben Fogle has backed the Blue Marine Foundation project and will help transfer the first 1,500 oysters. Olympic champion Sir Ben Ainslie has already supported the bid. Oyster fishing in the Solent was banned after the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Project found the molluscs were failing to reproduce as a result of water quality, invasive species and over fishing. A pilot project, involving adult oysters, was previously held at Ainslie's racing team's base and at the University of Portsmouth's raft in Langstone Harbour. Following its success, Blue Marine Foundation said 10,000 juveniles would be transferred to cages at the two sites, as well as at four marinas across the Solent over the next month.

Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park confirmed it has issued a provisional tree preservation order after a campaign. Along with the bike, it is thought a ship's anchor and chain and parts of a horse's bridle may also have been swallowed up by the sycamore's expanding trunk. The tree is in Dorothy's Field, Brig o'Turk, about half a mile north of the village on the Glen Finglas road and about seven miles west of Callander. The tree is thought to have self-seeded, sometime in the late 1800s, and gathered the metal as it was next to a blacksmith's scrapheap.", "Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs a meeting will be called once there is a resolution on Northern Ireland following earlier elections. Mr Davis said that does not meant there will not be \"further discussions\". He hinted the devolved administrations would get notice of the triggering of Article 50. He told the Brexit committee: \"We will be having conversations with them beforehand\". Mr Davis told MPs that a meeting of the joint ministerial committee (JMC) on European negotiations would be held \"as soon as we can once we have a resolution on Northern Ireland.\" An executive has yet to be formed after elections to Stormont earlier this month. Mr Davis confirmed that the Brexit bill, which allows the prime minister to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal Brexit process, is expected to become law on Thursday.

Robins are adapted to hunting insects in dim light, so are thought to be particularly sensitive to the effects of artificial lighting. The researcher said blue light from neon signs was likely to be especially disruptive to the birds' body clock. Dr Dominoni was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting, in San Jose, California. He said: \"I live in Glasgow now and I hear robins singing throughout the night, singing all the time. Robins are one of the most sensitive species to light.\" In order to investigate the phenomenon, Dr Dominoni is putting cameras in nesting boxes to find out when robins sleep. But the reasons for the robins' nocturnal singing have been a subject of some debate. Other researchers have proposed that the birds predominantly sing at night in urban areas because it is too noisy", "Turkey launched the Ilisu dam project on the river Tigris in the 1950s, but legal battles tied up work on it until 2006.

The government says the dam will provide the country with much-needed power generation and improve local irrigation, but critics complain that thousands of years of cultural heritage will be lost. The government is building a new town for the displaced locals, and a museum to house ancient monuments, but opponents say there is much more to be explored from an archaeological perspective.

It can irritate the skin and cause breathing and digestive problems.

Lindane is still used in some developing countries. And it is an ingredient in some head lice and scabies treatments used in some countries, including China, India, the US and Canada. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) panel also concluded that another insecticide, called DDT, was \"probably carcinogenic to humans\". And it classified a third insecticide called 2,4-D as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Most uses of DDT have been banned since the 1970s, but the IARC says exposure to DDT still occurs, mainly through diet. This is because DDT and its breakdown products are highly persistent and can be found in the environment and in animals. Since its introduction in 1945, 2,4-D has been widely used to control weeds in agriculture, forestry, and urban and residential settings. Occupational exposures to 2,4-D can", "Clive Seaman, 60, of Taunton, was found guilty of 10 counts of sexual abuse by a jury at Exeter Crown Court. The assaults happened in the 1980s and included three that would now be classed as rape of a child.

Sutton was a town councillor in Combe Martin, Devon, where he moved to start a new life after a previous conviction in London in 2010. The convictions were for downloading indecent images and trying to contact a 14-year-old girl online.

Gilligan's Island, which ran from 1964 to 1967, was about seven travellers marooned on a Pacific island. The Brady Bunch (1969 to 1974) was about a clean-cut, attractive family formed by the marriage of a widow and widower and their six children. Analysts say the shows were hit in part because they presented a wholesome image of America during a time of social upheaval. Both programmes have endured on countless television repeats, influencing generations of children in America and beyond who never saw them on the original run. Mr Schwartz conceived of the idea for The Brady Bunch in 1965 after reading that one-third of American households at the time included a child from a previous marriage. \"I realized there was a sociological change going on in this country, and it prompted me to", "They claim that under Barnett formula rules, Wales should get an extra \u00a31.67bn and Scotland \u00a32.9bn.

The Barnett formula is used by the UK Treasury to determine how much extra money should go to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in the event of an increase in public spending in England. Wales' Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and his Scottish counterpart Derek Mackay have insisted Barnett rules should apply in this case too. \"The UK Government has abandoned these well-established arrangements to the detriment of Wales and other parts of the UK,\" Mr Drakeford said. \"It is simply inexcusable that the UK Government is willing to 'bypass' those rules.\" He added: \"At a time when public services in Wales are under pressure as a result of the UK Government's damaging and ongoing policy", "Fewer pupils have missed lessons and preliminary test results show an improvement after changes were made following a critical Ofsted report.

The schoolboy was in several heavy tackles before collapsing near the end of the game in January 2011. He had been momentarily knocked out at the start of the second half of play. His parents had argued he should have been taken off the pitch at that point in the game. The coroner said this was the first recorded death due to second impact syndrome in Northern Ireland and probably in the rest of the UK.

Researchers from Bradford University presented their work at the British Science Festival. Collaborations between the group and international film studios are ongoing. Traditionally, motion capture is only used to record the movement of humans. Animals are created directly by animators, but they can make mistakes if the biomechanics are not fully understood - and it is time consuming work. This can lead a film audience into an \"uncanny valley\", where focus is shifted from the story to the inaccuracy in the animation. Motion capture works by placing cameras with infrared LEDs around an area containing an object, person or animal wearing reflective markers. The light hits the reflective markers and thus the marker's position is reflected back and recorded. This is not new technology, but the", "Media playback is not supported on this device Shapovalov was fined $7,000 (\u00a35,600) for his actions during a Davis Cup match with Great Britain's Kyle Edmund.

The barometer measures areas such as levels of staff demand, employment and wages to create a single-figure snapshot of labour market conditions. The figure is measured against a baseline of 50, with anything above representing an improvement and anything below a deterioration. Edinburgh recorded the strongest increase in permanent placements and Dundee the largest rise in temporary positions across the country.

Mr Khamenei accused the US of reneging on the West's nuclear deal with Iran and said trusting them was a \"mistake\".

Scientists analysing data from Nasa's Mercury Messenger spacecraft now think this mystery darkening agent is carbon in the form of graphite. This graphite may be a relic of the planet's primordial crust, which was later covered up by volcanism. The findings are published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Patrick Peplowski from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Maryland and colleagues analysed measurements of the darkest parts of Mercury's surface taken by Messenger at the end of its mission. They found that the darkest \"stuff\" on Mercury had a carbon-rich composition and that it was associated with large impact craters. According to the team, this association is consistent with the dark material coming from deeper within the planet and being exposed when space rocks gouged it out.

These deflected light patterns help electronics \"learn\" walking patterns and detect if they are deteriorating, for instance in the elderly. The carpet was demonstrated at the Photon12 conference in Durham, UK. The optical fibre network at the heart of the effort makes use of the same types of fibres that transmit data to homes and across oceans, in which light bounces along the fibres' length. To make them sensitive to the deflection caused by pressure, the researchers carved grooves in the fibres along their length so that the bouncing of the light was less efficient at the point where pressure was applied. Detectors at the carpet's edge convert the light into electrical signals which are then analysed by a computer. That analysis borrows heavily from technology developed at the university for use with medical scanners.
